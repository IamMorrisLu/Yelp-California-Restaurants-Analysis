SHk_eYKzIOPvgwvTThtXiQ,Romaine's,American,positive,"I am an avid customer. The specialty breadsticks=the bomb. Plus if your salad weighs more than 6.15 you get a free breadstick! Good selection for anything you want. Nice employees. Hot soup. If your looking for a salad bar, go to romaines!"
SHk_eYKzIOPvgwvTThtXiQ,Romaine's,American,positive,"If you love healthy and fresh food, then this is the place to go! :)

Huge variety in all kinds of salads, very fresh and well prepared. Lots of organic stuff.

Also, their soups are amazing, always super hot and with fresh ingredients.

BEST food on Campus."
SHk_eYKzIOPvgwvTThtXiQ,Romaine's,American,positive,"Only salad bar on campus (besides from the dining commons that are for the people living in the dorms) It has a large selection of fresh organic vegetables, leafy greens, seafood salads, pasta salads, potato salads, greek salads, nuts seeds and raisins, hot soups, FRESH BAKED BREADSTICKS (all whole wheat, and there is a special bread that is 20 cents more, but contains cheeses, pesto, artichockes, etc. the ingredients are always changing) and hot cornbread made that day as well. 

the price of your salad goes by weight. so the way it works is that you grab a plastic bowl, fill it up with as much as you want, and then you pay by the ounce. ($6.44 per lb) 

If you spend more than $6 on your salad, you get a free breadstick!"
SHk_eYKzIOPvgwvTThtXiQ,Romaine's,American,positive,"The butternut squash soup blew my mind and I was very tempted my their spanakopitas. Everything's fresh and I love that they have a large selection of toppings (almonds, chow mein noodles, dried cranberries, etc)"
SHk_eYKzIOPvgwvTThtXiQ,Romaine's,American,negative,"beware do not eat here!! 

i ate here with my girlfriend and we both got the worst food poisoning ever!!!

we had to go to student health and thought we were going to die it was so bad!

people on yik yak also asked if anyone else got food poisoning and they had to be hospitalized. i will be reporting romaines to the health inspector!!

do not eat here!!!"
SHk_eYKzIOPvgwvTThtXiQ,Romaine's,American,negative,"Gotta love college food.

Romaine's is a salad bar ""restaurant"" that also offers soup and baked potatoes.

They have organic spinach, green lettuce and spring lettuce mix. There is a sign that warns you might find bugs in the lettuce. Beware!

There are typical salad toppings, some pasta salads, etc. Some examples: egg, turkey, tuna, olives, tofu, cheeses, and so on. 

It's $0.50/oz, so don't get more than you can eat!

Their soups are ok. I like the Cauliflower Soup. The chicken ""Pozole"" is more like chile verde (not very good). Their breadsticks are ok. Their cake-loaf slices are tasty. I have yet to try their cookies.

Overall, because you can customize your meal, it's a good choice when you're hungry."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Brandon Ravens was the best server. He made us feel so personalized, brought the drinks in literally less than 2 minutes. He is so easy going but knows how to be professional at his job. Islands is a great place to relax, have a drink and maybe a fry or 2. My 2 friends and I felt as if we were in heaven, we love it here. Will definitely be coming back and becoming regulars. We love the entire staff. 10 outta 10"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Chain restaurant but their menu options are good, service is great, and everything fresh."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,The cheddar fries are quite delicious and the service was exceptional. Come here if you want a chill time and some good food.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Decided to check out Islands and wasn't disappointed the food was delish and the service was outstanding we did have to wait a bit but it wasn't bad they texted us to tell us our table was ready. La Cumbre needs more people friendly places, while we waited we walked around and it was a ghost town...sad compared to how it used to be"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Great service by Lety and atmosphere Glad to know they have Gluten Free bread! Loved the Beach Bowl with Hoison sauce.  Couple of suggestions: keep the salt/seasoning off fries and add grass feed beef to the menu; I'm sure customers such as myself would pay more for that option.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,This restaurant is so great I can come here all the time and  it's not that expensive so that's why love islands
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Excellent service and the hamburgers!!We highly recommend cocktails are also wonderful and Alexis was the best!!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Love this place.. Atmosphere is amazing.. Every employee is polite, happy and very courteous.. it makes me happy to be here every single time..I never order burgers anyplace else.. but the burgers here are amazing!!! I highly recommend Islands to everybody!! Don't miss out"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Absolutely amazing service. They were so helpful with the menu and more than patient with us as we were catching up with friends and couldn't decide what to get! The food was amazing and the drinks are delicious. Can't wait to go back! :)
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Islands sucks! Nobody knew what they were doing, service was terrible, we had to get up to go order at the kitchen, we got our bill before our food, after half an hour we ask to check on our order and they bring it out packaged to go! So I take it in stride and say thank you, pull out my food, unpackaged my food...and there is no silverware, so I ask for silverware, and the guy says ""it's in the bag"", so I then explain further that I would like a fork that is not plastic, and he says ""well your food is to go so we give usually give plastic utensils""... wtf I didn't order my food to go!!!!! Food is not that great either."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"It's basically The Habit. The Burgers were a bit larger but double the price, quality was equal. Service was slow. Took 20 mins to meet our waiter. They forgot the waters twice. Took 15 mins for the bill after asking for it. 99 out of 100 you will find me at The Habit. Wasn't a good experience."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Went in for lunch today with my husband and ordered two burgers medium rare- husbands burger came out perfect but mine was medium well. I was talking and didn't realize it until I was on the second half of my burger( literally had half a burger left) and showed the waitress each burger and said it was ok but to let the manager know that they need to make sure the burgers are getting cooked to order. She said ok and left. Then some girl who looked barely 18 walked up and asked what the problem was. I let her know about the burgers and she had the nerve to tell me that ""next time I come in and noticed this BEFORE MY MEAL WAS FINISHED she would be able to help me"". I let her know that my meal was only half way eaten and that I had just noticed it. I also let her know that I was not trying to get her to comp my meal and she said she understood and was not there for that reason. ? Really- you call yourself a manager? I worked in restaurants from 16 to 26 and would have never treated a customer that way. I paid the bill , left a 20% tip FOR the waitress and left. Never to return to this particular restaurant even though I love Islands and they are only 2 minutes away from home.  Nope. I'm good. Good luck in that shopping center- restaurants don't last, especially with rude managers

On the other hand the waitress/ bartender was awesome! Great service. And the fries were fantastic! This review is only regarding the manager, the over cooked burger, and the unusually high bar stools that are extremely uncomfortable."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Went in for lunch on my break with a co-worker, seated right away as the restaurant was not busy. We were sat in a booth across from 3 booths that were dirty and had dishes piled up on them. After about 10 minutes with no server in sight, the manager came over to take our order, he was nice. After he left, a few minutes later a guy pops up and says can I take your order. We said we just ordered, he said ""no worries"", which was the beginning on the ""no worries"" marathon. Each time our waiter came by for any reason, he said ""no worries"", we could even hear him saying it at other tables.... no! Make it stop!!! Utensils were dirty, order was wrong, restaurant was completely disorganized and dirty. Needless to say, l will not be going back."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Best local spot in town. Amazing wait staff and the the manager Brandy will go above and beyond to make sure you have a amazing meal and experience! She adds a personal touch to every trip that makes you feel welcome. Best burgers, beer and Brandy in town!!!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Carol was amazing! She was not only sweet but very attentive! We always had refills at the table at all times. Everyone including the server assistants were very attentive as well! Always asking if we needed anything else. i would also like to say this new location is beautiful! Good job
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I was craving chicken wings at 9:30 pm and it being SB, there is not much choice for wings. 
We were greeted at the door, they opened the door for us and sat us near the back of the restaurant.  I got chicken wings as my entree and chili cheese fries as an app. And le bf got the moa loa chicken burger? I don't remember if that's what it's called but it was basically a buffalo chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce. With no blue cheese. 

Our server was on top of refills and really friendly. I wish I could remember her name.  

Chili cheese fries were huge and delicious. Really cheesy. Will order again. 

Buffalo wings were ok; they were a little on the soggier side than crispy side. Probably won't order again. 

Le bf said his chicken burger was really good. He would order it again. 

All in all it was pretty good!  Excited to explore the menu!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Nice happy hour, but waaaayyy too much oil used in their cooking. Plate was soaked... yuck"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Met a friend here for lunch this week.  The restaurant has only been open a month.  They did a great job with the decor and kept the same footprint as the old Marmelade.  They added some comfortable booths so that's nice.  We were seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  Since we hadn't seen each other in awhile and were talking, it took some time to realize no one came by.  
It took 15 minutes for our server to bring two iced teas.  We ordered and the food came out fairly quickly.  When our server left,  my friend realized we had no chicken on our salads.  We both happened to have ordered the same thing.  I also had asked for my dressing on the side.  It was not.  Finally our server came back by and we waited again to have the problem fixed.  
Fast forward to the bill.  After checking it out we noticed we had been charged for three salads not two.  They fixed that little problem as well.  Check your bill always!
Bottom line,  I won't be rushing back there anytime soon."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"The menu here has delusions of grandeur - i don't think the food is worthy of the prices they charge. But, the food is decent, the service is good, and the atmosphere is, well, an Islands. If that's what you're looking for, then you're in luck! Happy hour makes it reasonable."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"It was nice to hear that an islands was coming in to town we go with our friends to the one down by there house because they have decent variety of meal choices and great options for kids. They have a few options if you are trying to eat healthy also. Our waitress was nice and our food came out fairly quickly but a couple of dishes weren't as hot as they could have been. 
The thing that I really hate especially on weekend afternoons is being told that I have to wait 15 to 20 minutes when there are multiple booths open with only a few people in waiting."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"This is a first impression review, but I do want to go back after our first visit.
The burgers were quite good and much better than expected, though the fries were a little bland. I had a mai tai, which was super fruity and flavorful! We came during Happy Hour, but ended up getting charged non-Happy Hour prices for drinks. Apparently only the bar area and outside seating and subject to Happy Hour prices, which I don't think was advertised clearly enough. I can understand why they do this though (presumably to separate the Happy Hour crowd from the family crowd), but a bit more indication would have been nice, as the price difference was over $10. We talked about it with the waitress though, and they gave us the discounted prices afterwards! This definitely makes me want to come back again."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Server kept calling me ""boss,"" which I found annoying. He transferred us to a new server named Summer while he took a dinner break. She was very nice and accomadating. The food itself was very okay. I ordered the Maui burger which wasn't anything to write home about and my girlfriend got the Hawaiian burger which she said had way too much teriyaki sauce on it. I also witnessed an employee eating fries with his bare hands from where the guest's food comes out which is a health code violation. I'll be going to the habit across the parking lot the next time I have a craving for a good burger."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,I am not sure why the negative reviews?  I have been there twice and it was great each time.  Good food and GREAT service!  Glad they are in Santa Barbara now:)
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Meh ... the best thing about this place is their happy hour specials Sunday- Thursday... good prices .. but would not return otherwise. The meat in their sliders was too dry, not flavorful. Their fries where super hard. I'd prefer The Habit over these guys any day. I tried the nachos too... they were ok, I liked the better than the burgers and fries!!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,Super disappointed. Grew up going to Islands and always loved it and enjoyed the food. Haven't been to Islands in awhile and decided to try it out again because of all the fond memories I've had from there in the past and was frankly disgusted. The burger itself was way too over cooked and dry. Left feeling gross and oily.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great location off freeway. Plenty of parking. Friendly hosts and servers. Wait time for a party of five was less than five minutes. I ordered the low calorie Northshore tacos I believe. Tacos were light, tasty, not overlysauced. Ice tea refills came in fast and steady. We hung out for more than a hour at the outside patio dining area. Endless fries...need I say more. Server was very attentive."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"We really like this place!  We've been here once for lunch and ordered online once for dinner.  Online ordering works really well.  It lets you select exactly which ingredients you want on each dish and then pick up your order ~35 minutes later.  Since this place just opened, when we went to pick up our order, it was packed with numerous people waiting for a table, but our order was ready and waiting!  They got our order exactly right, even though we customized our dishes.

This place isn't fancy, but the ingredients are fresh and made well.  It's a great place for a burger or sandwich.  So far we've tried their burger, turkey burger, grilled chicken breast sandwich, and both regular and sweet potato fries.  Their burgers and sandwiches include endless fries if you eat in the restaurant.  My husband likes the regular burger.  I prefer the ground turkey patty with wheat bun.  The turkey patty has a good flavor, is tender, and isn't salty.  The grilled chicken breast is okay.  We've had it twice; once it was tender, the other time, it was a little tough and a bit rubbery.  They use fresh pineapple in their Hawaiian burgers, and their fries are cut fresh.  I like that they go easy on the seasoning salt on the fries, so everything is just right and not too salty.

The atmosphere inside is pretty loud, so ordering takeout the 2nd time around was just right for us."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I have always enjoyed Islands and this location is excellent. Stopped in for lunch and the food was hot off the grill. Great quality and also very attentive, pleasant service. Highly recommend."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I've visited the restaurant with my husband and my three kids, and none of us liked it. The food is expensive and very bland."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great happy hour. Great place to bring kids. The Beach Bowl with Teriyaki and either fish or chicken is the best item on the menu, can be meatless too. Staff is super friendly as a culture. Ice cold beer mugs. Turkey burgers are made in house, as well as fresh cut fries in house, and the fries order size is huge. Nachos with chicken or chili or ""the works""(both chicken and chili) are also particularly tasty. Lastly, on a cold day like today the tortilla soup is delicious and in large bowl, all you can eat. For the folks who like to eat out with the family and be served by their community in a chillaxed atmosphere."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great food and service!  Brandon was great. Loved the fish tacos, veggie tacos - and the fries of course!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Islands is a great chain for families with kids and I am thrilled with the healthier menu options like veggie burgers and island slaw.  It is nice to have the chain in SB which has traditionally been pretty averse to chains.  For the most part the service is pretty good, our most recent visit the service was AWESOME, but there have been some issues with slowness and wrong menu items in the past, which were likely more a result of them being newly opened and just ironing out the kinks.  I'm sure this will become a regular place for us for a quick and easy dinner."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I wish I could give more stars, but I can't. After being told the wait time for 2 was 20 minutes and the hostess clicked 30-35 minutes on the tablet right in front of my face, we weren't seated for an hour and 10 min. 5 parties of 2 who arrived AFTER us were seated BEFORE us."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Happy hour fail! After ordering all our food and drinks on happy hour and hanging out after happy hour we were charged regular price and had to dispute the bill. HOWEVER, that wasn't the biggest issue! The waitress accidentally spilled ranch all over my friend, it was a complete accident and we felt horrible for the poor girl. Then the manager comes out and talks our ears off about his life but doesn't offer to take at least an appetizer or drink off the bill for the inconvenience of now being covered in ranch I mean it was everywhere! I also paid 10.50 extra on my already pricy margarita for an extra shot that was not added and even after I explained to the waitress she wanted to argue with me about it. I've ordered that drink before from islands, not to mention if one drink had two shots of tequila you would be able to taste it. Needless to say I probably won't be back!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great Restaurant experience overall. Love arriving hungry and leaving satisfied and full. I got a cheeseburger and added avocado. The avocado was just perfect and bright. I also got a chocolate milkshake, they're very thick at first but very tasty, they are big though definitely share-friendly. Service was also 10/10 very fast and many check ins."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Back for a burger. I had the new French Onion burger. Good solid burger with suateed onions and grueyer cheese.I think the patty was under seasoned. I added their spice mix and the whole burger popped with flavor. Maybe someone missed it on the grill. I loved the fries! All unique sized and different levels of crunch. My wife like the smaller crunchy ones. She had the Greek salad (again).. loves it and I admit it is very good. But...my Bloody Mary was very weak.If anyone is spending money on a cocktail they want to know they had one. The service was great. Haley has served us before and she really is on point. Overall, burgers are good and we will  return."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,So happy to have an Island burger again! Food and service was excellent. Our waitress Priscilla was wonderful. There for my friend Lilly's 88th birthday and they brought her a bowl of ice cream with a candle in and sang her happy birthday!  It was wonderful. Definitely going back. I had my favorite the hula burger and it tasted great as usual!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great service, super bomb food, relaxing environment. We loved everything about this place and the experience. Its a very well run restaurant, the staff know their jobs and are doing them well. 
Friday night, 2 of us, waited about 15 minutes and were seated, had the Longboard Burger with Onion Rings (hubby had his with fries). Yum. Worth every penny. We'll be back for sure, cant wait to try everything on their menu"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Thursday night and the place was packed! That was great to see. Despite being super busy our wait time was only about 20 minutes.  Kaitlin was our server and clearly in training as she was being shadowed by someone, but she did an exceptional job and handled our very needy table with the skill of a veteran server.  Her smile and friendly demeanor made us all comfortable as we struggled with which one of the great beers to have. Yes, they have a good selection of beer! Hey Newbury Park store, you could learn something from this! It's the sole reason I don't dine there more! Anyway, we were all super impressed with our entire experience here. Great food, great beer, great service! We will definitely return!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I was pleasantly surprised to hear we were getting an Island's here in Santa Barbara. It's been awhile but I've visited one in Orange County and I remembering it being really good. This time, not so much. The burgers were nasty. Each half of the bun was slathered in a TON of mustard. Geez, why? No mayo. Buns were soggy and the patty was over salted and over cooked. The beans were way over salted. One taste made me just about gag. The fries were dry and over salted as well. Very unpleasant. In general the food tastes like over processed, frozen food that's been microwaved. It just has that quality. We were kicking ourselves over not going to the Habit across the parking lot. Which I comparison, is fresh, delicious and cheaper! I felt bad because I told my husband how good Islands was and it ended up being a total letdown. Not going back."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I often complain about cooks that under season food. Many times this means merely adding salt and pepper.
Today we checked out this new La Cumbre Plaza venue.
Clearly, the cooks here need a lesson as to when and how much salt to add.
This is what we ordered:
Spinach Artichoke Dip
Cheese Fries 
Nachos
The Spin/Arti dip was Ok but needed salt and pepper because the taste was wimpy.  Something with spice as in crushed red pepper or jalapeño  would have really helped.
The sad thing here is that the accompanying chips were fresh and crispy.
Both the Fries and the chips in the Nachos were ridiculously over salted. And I mean someone on the cooks line extremely over salted both appetizers. 
Again: all of the elements of both dishes were first rate but all were drowned in a sea of salt which makes the fact that the Guacamole was fresh and tasted of pure avocado not avocado from the freezer.
I'm thinking that one specific person on the appetizer line was adding salt, a lot of salt for no other reason than he likes salt. So this is more of a head cook thing than an Islands procedure thing,
I mean I get it: appetizers are meant to be salty in order to promote the ordering of drinks. But should the food be so salty as to raise our blood pressure by 10 points?
All that said: Islands on State is a beautiful facility.  And the service from all was efficient and first rate. Plus the manager did not hesitate to allow my Yelp 5% discount. And he did it with a smile.
So what does all of this boil down to?
Islands deserves another go I think, maybe my one visit was not indicative of their menu as a whole. Also: my Island friends you are just steps away from Lure and as such you have to get it together, Peace."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Excellent burgers, drinks, and service from our friendly waiter, Erik! :) This is one of my go-to burger places whenever I visit Southern California."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,This place has ok food. Prices are a little too high for what it is. But on the bright side you do have the fries to wait for. When I went there the wait was an hour and 30 minutes. A little long
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Phenomenal food and even better service. Our server Mackenzie was not only a doll, but a very well trained, knowledge server who knew the menus inside and out. Reccomend the right beers for our main courses and ALWAYS had a smile on her face. Giving the Habit a VERY good run dmfor their money"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"So this isn't my first time at Islands but it just might be my last. Went in earlier and was told about happy hour so we sat at the bar. Ordered water and some appetizers. 2 orders of wings actually. We talked and enjoyed our wings and before we had a chance to order more food, they bring us our check and tell us to have a nice day. Never asked if we wanted more food(we absolutely did) refresh our drinks(yes we did). I understand the hustle and bustle of a restaurant especially on Sundays, but I felt that we were rushed out of the restaurant as if we were bothersome. I left a little note on the receipt stating this same the fact that I have posted here. Never have I felt that way before or being rushed. Thank you for the customer service."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Always a great time, great service and delicious food. On our visit this evening we were pretty ""needy"" customers and our server Kat handled it with a smile. Her manager Leo was very helpful as well. We will be back."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Would've given a worse review, but the manager, Ruben, took care of us. Acknowledged the issue with a poor server, and worked to make it right. Maybe the issue is because they're new? Not sure. Because of Ruben, I'd be willing to try again.

Here's the full review:

Went about two weeks ago, and had terrible service. We were seated on the patio with two separate large groups with kids. Took 10 minutes to even be acknowledged, and then our food ended up coming before our drinks. Had to wave down the girl server (not the one who took our order) who was shocked we hadn't received drinks. Unfortunately, there was a ""glitch"" in my boyfriend's order, so it went in after I received my food. Had to ask the server for a salad so he wasn't siting watching me eat. His food came out another 10 minutes later. Once the other table finally left, our server was more attentive. Perhaps he thought they would tip more? No clue. We complained to the manager - Ruben - who apologized profusely, and comped our meal."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Since I already frequent Islands in my area, when I found out this was opening I had to come. I managed to get a spot to their ""trial run"" and was blown away. 

First off, this location is beautiful. The bar top is amazing. The contrast of dark and light natural wood really give this place a unique look. It's very modern with a tropical feel. Apparently, majority of the pictures hanging were taken by Santa Barbara natives and in the surrounding area. I thought that was a neat little fact. 

The place was swarming with staff and managers. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. Many people stopped by and asked if we need anything or just to see how they were doing tonight. For a brand new place, I never would have known they weren't fully open yet. 

The food was delicious. Everything was so fresh and looked amazing. They're wings, the best. I get them at every location and they're hand downs some of the best ever. No one ever believes me but they really are. A must try. 

All in all, it was a really awesome experience. I highly recommend it. It's a fantastic addition to the area and the food / staff alone makes it worth. Great job you guys! I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,Great location.. bugers are above average ...Service was a+ even though they were quite busy . Hope to try again in near future.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Summer was an amazing server ! Made it super easy to order and was attentive. Will definitely be coming back because of the great service and atmosphere
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Staff was wonderful!! Food great and wonderful lunch specials!!! Thank you Brooke!!! Paradise in paradise!!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Burgers there are amazing !!! I cant fer enough fries are really good great beer options too great environment to bring your family and friends
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Loved the bloody mary mix!. I had the fish tacos, while the fish wasn't very flavorful, the meal was very good. Get the beans as they are unique, with a hint of barbeque sauce. Wife had the greek salad and was impressed with the quality of the feta (melt in your mouth). Décor is classic surf theme. Server was excellent. We will be back for the burgers."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Go to place for great happy hour and great beers.. Travis and everyone who works there provides great customer service. The manager walks around to make sure you've had an amazing experience as well.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Eh, nothing outstanding. In fact they have to over cook your burgers to comply with their ""house rules"" so expect a dried out burger, no pink center. Also, food seemed salty, but that is probably typical for a burger joint. It's fancier than fast food, and a good place to bring families, teams, etc. something for everyone off the menu and it's inexpensive or maybe reasonably priced for SB. I have no plans to go back. Miss Lure"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Good food, reasonable prices, the music is really loud.

It's a shame. The music is pablum, and not what I'm here for."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"My husband & I couldn't wait to visit this old favorite place when it appeared in the sophisticated Santa Barbara atmosphere. Yes, we love all the individual, unique menu restaurants here, but having a dependably good lunch for two for around $20 is nearly impossible.
Hence, Islands. The great familiar interior, (our first was Pasadena, second, Valencia) slightly upscale,fits well in it's newest location. 
Lunch specials were ideal, since we wold have ordered the Big Wave (regular & vegetarian) anyway. The huge burgers are accompanied by a load of fries, (extras went home with us) and non-stop iced tea and Coke. Our server was so attentive, we never had to summon him, even though the place was packed. Out the door for around $26, (including a good tip) with a couple of the famous Islands drink coasters. All smiles."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Food was mediocre, at best. Really disappointed about their burgers - perhaps, my expectations were too high. Too many people approaching me about how things are - they need to chill out"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Kyle was our server and he was amazing!!! This place is great. They offer endless Coke's and fries! The service is amazing. Kyle was quick and helped us in and out. We loved him!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Two of us came over for lunch after 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We were seated right away. It was my first time at this specific restaurant. 

Our table had not been reset for service. No napkins, no utensils. When we did get utensils, I sent mine back twice because the knives were filthy.

We waited for almost 10 minutes before a manager came over and took our order. Manager was fantastic. 

In the meantime, the three tables next to us were piled with dishes. And stayed that way.

Our waiter finally appeared and asked to take our order. Ummmm.... we already placed our order. He said ""no worries"".

He continued to say ""no worries"" every single time he came to the table. I counted 7 times. We even heard him say it to another table.

Food was good.... got my order wrong, but it was easily fixed and the food was tasty.

I won't be back. Service here is a joke. Cleanliness is a joke."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great service. My buddy and I had an amazing time today. Not just the food but we were very impressed with our server/bartender, Eric. When  things weren't just right he went out of his way to make us happy. First time I've seen my buddy give a $20 tip! Good job, Eric. You are appreciated."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Love this place.. Atmosphere is amazing.. Every employee is polite, happy and very courteous.. it makes me happy to be here every single time..I never order burgers anyplace else.. but the burgers here are amazing!!! I highly recommend Islands to everybody!! Don't miss out!!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Awesome addition to the Santa Barbara list of great places to go! Totally kid friendly and have always been super busy. The staff although young was excellent and very attentive! Fun atmosphere ZERO attitude!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Fun atmosphere, fantastic service, yummy food! We went on a Friday night after football practice with two ravenous kids. We were seated quickly, orders were taken right away, and we enjoyed our burgers and salad! Plenty of tables and love the outdoor patio with fire at one table! Manager is super friendly and attentive! Check it out!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"BEWARE- they steal at this location! usually love Islands and have been to many different locations but this location steals. We ate here for dinner. After I signed my receipt with the intended tip, they added $10 more to the tip. I called to rectify the discrepancy but I have not heard from them since then even after giving them my number and the receipt number. I was looking forward to coming here- there are not a lot of child friendly places and this ruined it for me."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Went in last Sunday to check the place out. Cannot complain about the service; very prompt and courteous, and the food came quickly. We both ordered burgers. They were nothing special, the meat was somewhat dry, but our waiter said they would be cooked medium and I think it said something about that on the menu too. But both of us detected a rancidity in the oil used on the bun (buns were toasted.) I read another reviewer mentioning this as well. We spoke to the waiter and he went to the kitchen, came back and said that next time we should ask them not to use the soy-based butter substitute. We work in the food industry. This was rancid oil. I suspect they keep a big tub of it near the griddle, which is hot. That is the worst thing you can do with an oil product as this promotes oxidation which leads to rancidity. The main reason I am writing this is to get the attention of the kitchen manager so that they check this oil and insure that it is kept fresh."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I have never had a worst waitress or restaurant experience in my entire life. Not only did I wait 20 minutes before being helped, she also forgot everything. Two seconds after we ordered she looked at us and asked ""wait just to make sure you wanted the normal chicken right?"" Umm no we ordered the spicy which was just discussed. This woman next to me also had a long wait before our waitress came to help her, and again after she ordered the waitress I think her name was Heidi had to go back and ask her what she wanted again. I can understand having a bad memory, but maybe use a pad and pencil to write it down if you can't rememeber. We asked for an extra fork and ranch which the ranch took another 10 minutes to get to us, and had to re ask for a fork. She asked if we needed anything else but at this point I wasn't ready to wait 10 years for a plate. Never did she check up one us, she was barley around so I couldn't ask for the check. And once she finally did come around it took 20 minutes for the check which I assume she forgot to get us because another waitress brought it when we made eye contact with her. This meal took us an hour and should've only taken 20-30 minutes, since we only ordered cheese fries which came out in a timely manner. The place was basically empty and not at all busy, so I can't even find an excuse for this. Our waitress even took the time to chat and say hi to an old friend who came in, but couldn't find the time to help her tables.... I will never come back here which is a shame because I was excited to try the food even though it's insanely expensive."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,First time here and I instantly loved the vibe the second I got in! Everyone was very patient and kind! I will definitely be coming here more often with friends and family!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Have had issues here before, poor service, order not correct when served BUT TONITE was a different story. We voted n said one more bad experience and never again ! Tonite Rudy took care of us, always ready to get what we needed. Orders were correct, food served hot and kept our drinks topped off. 
Told the manager that Rudy was the Best n the reason we will return."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"We've been here for three times by now and we loooveeee it!!! Service was good, their piña colada and lava flow are so delicious and soft! Burgers are the best we've ever tried! All desserts are tasty and exquisite!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I was talking with a family member that insisted that islands was better than Red Robin, as I was comparing the two with her. It's got burgers and fries and drinks. And they are good. But I have to say, it's no RR. Sorry, but that being said, it IS a good burger! I would like to see Dos XX  on tap, but you can't have everything. Their tap choices are all the typical semi local brewery's fairs, which are pretty good! The fries... what can I say? Red Robin fries are bottomless!! Islands fries are hot crisp and just mushy enough inside. I filled up for sure! I'll go there again next time I find myself in the la cumbre plaza area."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"We tried Islands tonight and were very pleased with our meals and service. Started with the artichoke dip, portion was huge and we loved every bite:) 
Had the chili burger with fries for main and thought it was very good, yummy chili and excellent fries.
Managers were very friendly and on point making sure all customers were happy. We definitely will be returning soon for another great experience!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Longboarder with crispy onions and turkey patty, and American cheese.. It was very flavorful. Turkey patty moist but crispy on the edges.  This and the buffalo chicken sandwich have proven to be the best things to order here. The only downside was that the fries tasted a little fishy.."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,we've tried this place three times. The first time was good enough for us to come back again. The second time was mediocre at best. And the third time was only because we were in the neighborhood and rushed and they were open. We have had slow service. And terrible food. We sat at the bar on our third time and they actually forgot to bring us our order. The manager had to come apologize. It's just I don't know if they're too big and they're understaffed. If all our food comes from a box and it's heated? I don't know. I want to love this place. I've been to the Santa Barbara store and it's good. This place needs to get their act together.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Let me start off by saying this is the coolest decorated restaurant I have ever been to. The surfing decor is awesome and there is a lot of seating. This place is perfect for families.
Ordered a Maui burger with a turkey patty and onion rings. The burger patty had an odd, sort of sweet taste to it which I did not prefer. The onion rings, however were delicious!
My order took a little while to make, but the staff was friendly and helpful.
Overall, I would come back, I just would order something else besides the turkey burger."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"We have gone here a few times and the food was great every time.  The fries are super yummy.  The meals are large and have good flavor, and they have a good selection of items.  The staff is freindly and the food is great."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I came to islands Sunday. I was greeted by the sweetest most helpful hostess ever, I asked her name and she said it was Allison. First impressions are important and Allison gave a fantastic first impression, she was just so sweet and helpful. We were seated in a short time, and bam we were served by such a great and friendly server, so of corse I asked his name and it was Dylan. He did a superb job, and I am not the easiest person to serve, I can be a little picky. Between Dylan and Allison , they made my visit to Santa Barbara and islands that much more special. The next time I am in town I will definitely come back to islands to say hi to those two, and of corse have a great burger and cold beer.   Thanks you guys"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Back to square one!.......
Let me start by saying ...we are still, fairly regular customers.
Purely due to the cordial and polite staff in the front of the house.
They do everything possible to ensure that the patrons/ guests have a good dining experience.

As for the back of the house!!!!
A total disaster on all fronts.

Cold greasy fries ...potato and or sweet potato fries!
Cold soggy fried wings....even though we have repeatedly over the past 3 or more months, ordered/request extra crispy wings tossed in ""heat hot"" spicey sauce. 
With a side of ""heated"" extra sauce.....which everytime is forgotten and ends up coming straight from the fridge! 
But that's not the worst...... the meat is no longer all white, but more often, grey to purplish and rubbery, in place of the moist fall of the bone high quality wings they once served!!

Such a pity it's gone to pot....or is that what the smoke in the kitchen is...lol.

We shall be contacting head office again!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"You win some, you lose some.  I hadn't visited an Islands Restaurant in a few years so I was looking forward to visiting again.

  When I arrived with my party of four, I was told there would be a wait unless I agreed to sit outside.  It was a chilly Santa Barbara Saturday evening and two of my party were young children;  so I opted for the wait.  I left the family to use the restroom and I saw four or five booths available.  Are those only for 4+ parties?  Well, we were seated and server Katelyn took our order.

  After a 30-45 minute wait our orders arrived.  My wife got the wrong order so as the kids ate, we waited some more - and waited, and waited.  Rich the manager came with our food and apologized.  By that time the kids were done eating, it was getting late.  I brought the family in for dinner, not for a couple hours of sipping iced tea waiting for our entrees.  Katelyn generously brown bagged our dinner for us.  Compounded with the long wait time and wrong orders was exceedingly loud music - seriously loud, as in a Rave or dance club.  I asked Katelyn if she could ask the manager to turn it down.  I don't know if that message ever got to manager Rich because it was still loud when we left.  Maybe Katelyn couldn't hear me over the heavy base in the music? Curious thing is that most of the customers were seniors;  I don't see how the loud music would appeal to them.  

I can't really comment on the quality of the food, since all, I had was iced tea, but it looked tasty from afar.  

To end on a good note, Rich the manager did apologize and personally bring our orders to our table - what a stand up guy!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Had great service tonight. We enjoyed the spinach and artichoke dip, though the tortilla chips are a bit chewy. My son loved the longboard. Fries are ok. I DO NOT recommend the grilled fish tacos. Lacking flavor and freshness."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Consistently good food. Great place for families. We've tried everything, but really like their nachos, burgers and milkshakes."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Islands was wonderful!!! Our server matt was so great, helpful, and knowledgeable! He was simply wonderful and I would recommend any islands with matt"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Went in today on my lunch break with 2 coworkers. They sat us down we waited for 20 minuets and got no service. Others were sat down after us and got a server right away. They were not even busy when we walked in. Was really disappointed because was really looking forward to a burger. We got up and left, walked over to the Habit, served in 5 minuets there."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Wanted to try out the new spot in La cumbre plaza and we love it, Casual atmosphere and great vibes.

We will be back :)"

sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"This is one of the best restaurants I have been too! This is the best place to watch any sports event game and to eat burgers, tacos or sandwiches!! I came in to Islands restaurant with my boyfriend and his family for their first time and they including myself loved the food and the service. Our server Heidi was the best. She was very helpful and attentive to our needs. Heidi is by far one of the best servers I've received in Santa Barbara. She is wonderful!! We need more servers like her!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Oh my god, that was amazing we always used to the islands in LA but we now live in Santa Barbara. 
I have never eaten and had such great food served by amazing people in my life. We own a few sandwich shops in Santa Barbara and always like to support new restaurant. This by far has been the best experience in food and service in Santa Barbara for a long time. The management are super professional and also care about what they do. 

The wings are my favorite and the fries are to die for..great job everyone at Islands. !"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"They have some great food..burgers and salads highly recommended. The downside is the amount of turnover due to extremely poor management. I stopped going only because I got tired of hearing all the backstabbing. But it is definitely worth giving a try and hopefully, now with new management, your experience is well worth your time.

sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"First time coming here with my boyfriend. Yesterday my braces were tightened and as some know, it's hard to eat anything. 
My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and were attended within minutes as compared to other restaurants where you just sit there awkwardly.
The bartender was extremely nice and very attentive. Coming around every so often. Just in time for another drink.
We ordered the Mao something (it's a hard name). Lemme tell you it was just right. Nice and soft enough for me to able to eat and bite into the food. Fries were a little crunchy but my P.O is they were just right. 
We also ordered a smoothie. It was coconut, strawberry and banana I think and it was sooooo delicious. 
My overall opinion is this is probably one of the best restaurants in town. 
We'll definitely be coming back soon"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Honestly, not good. This place is seriously over hyped. Burger patties tasted like pure butter. The fries were obviously frozen and they tasted like they were recently pulled out of a bag. The burger looked good, but sadly the looks were better than the taste. The taste was pretty bland and boring. Honestly, save your time and money and go to habit right across the parking lot. The wait was ridiculous. All in all, I don't recommend this place at all."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"My son and I come to this location frequently.  We always have great service!  The staff is friendly and the food is great. 
I come with friends and sit on the patio at the ""fire table"" and enjoy the tropical cocktails and beer. 
I am surprised by some of the reviews because the service is always consistent and the servers are attentive and helpful (even when my son asks for a million things)."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"First and last time here. The world of ""fine"" should be removed from the name. Worst burgers, we have ever had. Don't think that patties were made from 100% beef. The taste and texture would tell what it was made from.
The one star is just for our waiters who was super friendly, kind and polite."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Drinks are on it! Incredible happy hour martini is $5!!! Absolutely can't be beat, besides the drinks the staff can most definitely not be be, our server heidi was so sweet what an angel, not to mention the incredible bar tenders (I think nay was her name). Thanks Tim and staff for the best day off a girl could ask for. Wouldn't expect this from islands, I will definite be back because of the customer service. Till next time :)"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I just have to say, being in the service industry, their wait staff rocks! The are a great team! Oh, and by the way, tasty food!"

sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Back open for business! They were SO nice-great service and great happy hour. They were really throwing out the welcome mat! Plenty of seats, lots of space and nice outdoor patio. Happy this place is open again, will be back!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Went in for lunch today with my husband and ordered two burgers medium rare- husbands burger came out perfect but mine was medium well. I was talking and didn't realize it until I was on the second half of my burger( literally had half a burger left) and showed the waitress each burger and said it was ok but to let the manager know that they need to make sure the burgers are getting cooked the way they are ordered. She said ok and left. Then some girl who looked barely 18 walked up and asked what the problem was. I let her know about the burgers and she had the nerve to tell me that ""next time I come in and noticed this BEFORE MY MEAL WAS FINISHED she would be able to help me"". I let her know that my meal was only half way eaten and that I had just noticed it. I also let her know that I was not trying to get her to comp my meal and she said she understood and was not there for that reason. ? Really- you call yourself a manager? I worked in restaurants from 16 to 26 and would have never treated a customer that way. I paid the bill , left a 20% tip FOR the waitress and left. Never to return to this particular restaurant even though I love Islands and they are only 2 minutes away from home.  Nope. I'm good. Good luck in that shopping center- restaurants don't last, especially with rude managers

On the other hand the waitress/ bartender was awesome! Great service. And the fries were fantastic! This review is only regarding the manager, the over cooked burger, and the unusually high bar stools that are extremely uncomfortable. 

Update:

24 hours after posting my review I was contacted by ""Lani"". - She asked me to rethink my review, see what she had to say below: 

""You should really think about revising your review. It's unfortunate that your burger was a tad over cooked, but to slam some young woman who probably just got promoted is disgusting. By your name and photo I'm guessing your a female, please try to think of supporting other women as opposed to what you are doing. Hopefully she hasn't lost her job over your post!"" 

Hummmmm NOPE!  NOT gonna remove or revise a truthful review. I wonder why this mysterious person wants me to do such a thing? Is she perhaps the manager I have been referring too in my review? Or her Mommy?"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Have been to this location multiple times and ordered take out as well on multiple occasions, only once have we had less than stellar service.  The perfect family time restaurant.  I have been here with the two young grandkids and their parents and we have always had excellent service and fantastic food and beverages. Would definitely recommend if you are visiting from out of town or just want a casual dinner with a casual drink.  Great service, great prices and super friendly people! Had an issue once, but let management know and it's been great ever since!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Place is pretty good. I like the environment and mood overall. Has nice flatscreens all around the restaurant so there are things to entertain us while we wait for our food
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,Place is pretty good. I like the environment and mood overall. Has nice flatscreens all around the restaurant so there are things to entertain us while we wait for our for our food
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"So So burger place that is pretty costly. There are many other choices in SB and Goleta.  Cajun Kitchen has a wicked huge burger and Habit is another great choice at a great price and Cal taco in Goleta is one of my Favs. I tried Islands with my wife and it was happy hour so they seated us and I was told after that we could not have any happy hour pricing as it was only good at the bar or outdoor seating, I wish they told me that before seating us. The burgers get quite expensive and we paid the full price on beer. My server was switched halfway through and it was hectic. I wish it was still Red Robin instead. Had the server honored happy hour pricing for us i would have left a better rating as that was a big turn off to us?!!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Had an amazing dinner there. Kim our waitress was amazing. It's been a long time since we had be given such outstanding customer service. Glad to know their are great waitresses that truly care about their customers. Could not ask for better good or service. Give her a raise.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Better than I expected, good service and pretty lively and kept clean inside. I got the miso grilled salmon rice bowl with veggies and it was really tasty. Nice amount of veggies with brown rice, so a great healthy and good tasting option."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,My famous Asada fries are the best. And the tortilla soup is amazing. I highly recommend. Tim  & Lonnie are awesome
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"All I ordered (delivery) were dessert items.. but I mean... haha. I thought it was a joke at first. This was a sundae and the other pic- no that's not a dollop of butter - that's the ice cream that came with the ""brownie with ice cream""..."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"From day one my wife and I ate regularly here and really enjoyed Islands,especially the good food and friendly service, but sadly it started on a slow downhill slide, which continued until after several further visits, and our positive input recommendation regarding the poor service and cold meals, we had enough..... I posted a one star review and my wife complained to the head office.
Such a shame!

Senior management contacted us and requested we revisit as secret shoppers, with a complimentary $20- gift card and report back....so here goes!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,Basically McDonald's with fake Hawaiian decor. The management and staff don't seem to care too much.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Sat at the bar with a friend. No complaints about the service. Everyone working there was friendly and efficient. I got the fish tacos and my friend got a burger. We also ordered a side of guacamole and chips. My main criticism is of the food. Everything was just bland, bland and bland. It's not that anything was really bad, it just lacked flavor. Maybe we're just spoiled by other good restaurants in Santa Barbara. It's probably a fun place for kids but we will not be going back."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"This place was definitely better than I expected it would be. To be honest, I only went because I had a gift card and was really craving a burger. Santa Barbara has a good burger scene and Islands has every right to be a part of it! The burgers were tasty, mostly because the toppings and combinations worked well together. My main concern was that the patty was very well done, despite having ordered it medium. The menu noted that they only do medium and up, which is a bit of a bummer given I'm much more of a medium-rare kinda person.

I will be honest, for a well-done burger, it was pretty good! I ordered a side salad with my meal, which was pretty average. Next time I will go all-out and get some fries. My boyfriend ordered them and I would recommend!! They were very crispy on the outside. We finished the meal with a vanilla shake, which was good but a bit too malty. 

Finally, the service was good! I felt like our waitress was incredibly busy but managed to juggle a ton of tables on a crowded night! It did take us a really long time to both a. get anyone's attention to order upon arrival, and b. get our food. Normally I'm not too picky with this, but it was pretty slow for a burger place!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"First things first. They have amazing service. Best service I have had. Food is pretty good as well, but again, I would come here just because the staff makes it so comfortable. Love this place!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great place, this is my new hangout spot with my dad on the weekend, I love this place."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I've been here a few times now since they've opened up in Santa Barbara and I've yet to be disappointed. My go to burger is the Sriracha Smack- definitely try it if you like semi-spicy food! The pepper crusted Kilauea burger is also super yummy!
The service here can be occasionally slow when they're super busy, but the staff is great. If you're looking for a semi-inexpensive place to grab a tasty burger on the weekend, this is your place!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Our server was personable and friendly. However, he never asked how the food was. My rice was dried out and tasted microwaved. The cooked carrots were also dried out. There was a random piece of lettuce on my plate that looks like it fell on from somewhere else. Our fries didn't come until we were all done with our meals (and we had to ask about them twice). My water was never refilled once. The rest of my family somewhat liked their meals, but not super impressed. Our wait time to be seated was about 15 mins even though there were at least 10 open tables around the restaurant. Also, the chemical smell from the cleaners or the soap from the bathroom was overwhelming anywhere near the restroom side of the restaurant. I will not go back."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great happy hour spot and love the family friendly vibe! Food is great and the bar is fun...service is on the ball and everyone is extremely friendly!
Love the new neighborhood spot!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,The food is pretty good and the waiters were on top of it. What is frustrating is that they do not serve happy hour throughout the whole restaurant. We were a whole family and they only have happy hour for the bar and the outside area. It was cold and real windy outside so we did not want to eat there and the bar did not have enough room for us. So therefore we should not be allowed to happy hour while we watch the games? Not sure about the sense and customer service in that?
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Food was a little pricey but good for burgers. The service was pretty slow for drinks, we waited a while for our first and even longer for our second. The drinks also did not taste like they had more than a half a shot in a giant pint glass. It was happy hour but all in all the drinks were not even worth that price."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Okay I come here a lot- happy hour deals with my dad and what not, but today was exceptional! 
I have a mango allergy (I usually tell staff, but I didn't think of it today) and I ordered the ""locals menu,"" fresh salmon. It was tasting great; too great, I thought! Asked my dad to see if the sauce tasted like mango- he agreed that it did. We asked our male server, I didn't catch his name. He went back to the kitchen, and our server Kim literally came running out to tell us it was mango free! She was so concerned, and took such great care. 
Secondly, I ordered a tequila sunrise but they were out of orange juice. I got a tequila with some pineapple juice instead, and she took it off the bill. 

All of our food was great, but that's not even the point- our servers, especially Kim took the time to make sure we were enjoying our food/drinks and that I was safe. What's the point of going out if the service isn't excellent?! 

Keep going like this, y'all! Great dinner and great staff. Way to go, management. :)"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"We were turned away from the nearby fish restaurant because we had our dog with us, so decided to get takeout from Islands. The service was very efficient despite the long line of people and our 5 meals took only 20 minutes to prepare. Each burger was packed in a box to prevent smashing and the fries also had their own cardboard box. The generous portion of fries were a tad too salty but otherwise excellent. The burgers were cooked to perfection and tasted great. La Cumbre Plaza is usually like a ghost town but the restaurants with expanded outdoor seating seem to be bringing things back to life."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Amazing onion rings, burgers came out perfect, friendly staff. Overall a great meal in a comfy booth. I will definitely be back!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Our favorite hangout, Islands,  now has Impossible Burger!
Fabulous!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"If you're looking for just OK food in an OK setting with OK service, this is the place for you. The burger and fish tacos were bland (I never add salt in restaurants but the fish tacos had absolutely no salt and it was mostly batter than fish). I would recommend instead going to Lure next door for a much better experience. Since I'm trying to be positive these days it is perhaps not a bad place if you're in your 20s wanting good but inexpensive beer on tap for happy hour and wanting to watch sports on multiple TVs."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I went in for lunch today and ordered their classic cheeseburger off their lunch menu. Comes with a HUGE basket of fries that were cooked perfectly! For under $10, they've got a winning combo here. Friendly service, and the a/c was at just the right temp.

The only downside was their free WiFi - it's slower than USPS. Seriously! Tim, the manager on duty said they're working on it, so that shouldn't be a deterrent. Starbucks next door has great WiFi, so it's probably just a faulty router. No biggie!

5 stars for a great lunchtime experience at a very reasonable price."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I had not been to an Islands since High school so my expectations were not super high. I was pleasantly surprised with the steak tacos (steak had great flavor!) and my husband enjoyed the Malibu burger (cheeseburger with bacon). We also sampled the fries, nachos, and wings which were pretty typical bar fare. Definitely stick to the entree (burgers/tacos) portion of the menu!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Me and the old man come here usually every Sunday evening during football season. We always sit at the bar, so we only get acquainted with the bartenders, and they're all pretty chill. Food is always good. I like the beach bowl, it's super healthy but darn tasty too! Prices are nothing special, they're about average, but c'mon, we live in Santa Barbara. The burgers look amazing, which I plan to try eventually. All around a good reliable place to get your football (or any sport) viewing on and enjoy some good ol' fashioned American food."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Came in here recently. Absolutely delicious food and great service. I will definitely be back. Loved the atmosphere.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Not the best islands, but fuck.. I've missed it since I moved here.. tortilla soup and fries, can't beat."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Not really impressed. Burger was dry and not too flavorful. Happy hour decent but the service was left to be desired. It's a chain so don't expect too much. So much in Santa Barbara, try somewhere else"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I've eaten at Islands on average once a week for past year but will no longer frequent this establishment in Santa Barbara.  The last three times have been a serious challenge culminating with my last visit.  A male server at the bar, who has been working there for a long time, and who has a habit of engaging in long animated conversation with customers, which causes serious neglect of other customers, did it one too many times. After receiving my drink, I sitting there with the menus, attempting to get his attention, waiving at him, only to have look ""through me"", all the while laughing and chatting it up with a young lady 15 feet down the bar.  After what seemed like 10 minutes I stood and started waiving both arms and saying ""excuse me"".  Once He came my way, he just didn't appear to care. I will most likely not go back even though they have great food at good prices."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"My wife and I love this place! The best burgers anywhere ever. Really. Their fries with skin on are non greasy and awesome. 
We have enjoyed A+ service as well. The only fly in the ointment was the deadpan bartender on a previous visit. I guess we got spoiled by the genuinely friendly waitstaff we have had before.  Always great places to sit and we love to sit at the bar."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Islands has quality food and amazing service. Kim (waitress) has an amazing attitude, great personality and made our experience unforgettable. Service is worth experiencing and highly recommend you try Islands out. Good for family, and HH."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,All the employees are so nice here. Great service  food is good too. My favorite is the beach bowl.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Our server literally saved our experience.  A big shout out to our server Alec who paid for our nachos because they were so late.  We could tell they were having a off night, most likely someone called out and people were working doubles.  If it hadn't been for our server being so nice and apologetic we would have left angry, but we left happy and left him a huge tip, as I'm sure he's dealing with some angry customers who are less understanding than us tonight."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Very disappointed. Islands has always been one of my favorites. The Togo lunch was much anticipated and I felt great about supporting one of my favorite restaurants however, both meals ordered were a huge disappointment. I had the yaki tacos and they had so much sauce that I couldn't eat them. They were drenched and it was like soup. We personally picked up the Togo order and our side beans was given to us sideways in the bag. Therefore it spilt juice all over the car. The side of beans was a ridiculous small portion. We ended up throwing our meal away and it's $30 I'll never get back. Won't be returning. The quality, quantity and service have nothing to do with Covid. Can't blame it on that."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,My new favorite place to eat! The staff is exceptional and friendly and the food is to die for. Easily the best fries I've ever had. Love the atmosphere and location and I hope they are here to stay!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Three years later.... well I said I would never return, but I did and I'm sorry for that. What a mistake! I won't waste anymore time explaining why. Just don't go to Islands Fine Burgers. YUK and a waste of money. The one star goes to the waitress."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,How do u forget the guacamole on the Maui burger. You might have well just served it with no patty.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I went last night with a friend. We were told 45 minute wait. We went to the bar and ordered a drink. We got texted about 1/2 hour later. 

The positive things I saw were: the staff is attentive, friendly and well-trained. They aim to please. 

I wanted a tropical drink but because of sugar content, I got a skinny margarita. It was ok. I had to ask for more tequila because it wasn't very strong. The bartender obliged me.

I ordered the Hawaiian burger with the slaw. The slaw was mostly tasteless like it had no seasoning. All I could taste was the vinegar. I asked for a caesar salad instead. That was fine. But the burger was a dried out, thin, tasteless patty. Really Islands? I can go to Mesa Burger and for less money, I can get a real, hand-made beef patty with lots of flavor by a celebrity chef. The stuff on the burger was unimpressive except the grilled pineapple was fresh (which is surprising). 

I'm not a huge fan of Habit Burger except the Tri tip sandwich, but their burgers have more going for them than Islands. 

My friend felt the same way about her choice of the Malibu burger. Just meh!

There are TVs everywhere. Why does every casual concept restaurant think folks just want to watch sports? I don't. I want atmosphere. There was nothing special about the decor. It was cold and cafeteria-like. If it was fun and tropical, it would've made a difference to me. 

And it was so LOUD! Even the servers talked loudly over tables to each other. 

If you like a loud, boring looking place that serves pricey, bland food and dried out, tasteless burgers, then head to Islands. I don't want to be mean, because I truly root for new places but I want the new places to actually be good. And this place was just so marginal!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great food, great service and reasonable price. We got happy hour menu slider which was delicious. It had onion fries and they were perfectly crunchy n yummy. 
Also got mango margarita which was big size, fresh and perfectly balanced. Would highly recommend this spot"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Great happy hour! Monday through Friday until 6:30pm. Good selection kids meal. Burgers are huge! Love the onion rings.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"We first heard of this restaurant when they had a booth at the UCSB Alumni event earlier this year. Their food was far and away the best of all the vendors. My son and his roommate loved the sliders.
Today I came down to take him shopping and we happened to be in the La Cumbre Mall and remember this restaurant was here. We came in for lunch and were not disappointed!
The ambiance is fun and comfortable, the service was outstanding and the food was even better then we remembered.
It may just look like a ""burger"" joint but the food was fresh and you could taste the quality of the ingredients.
My son wants to bring his roommates back and next time I come down, I am definitely trying one of the fun cocktails on the menu!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,This place sucked.  The service was slow.  It was very loud.  I asked for a medium burger and got a burned over cooked pice of meat. The fries were stale and the drink was watered down. You can get a 10 times better burger across the way at the hamburger habit for half the price.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Hey 1st night they're open and pretty successful! We only had a 15-20  minute wait to get a table so had a drink in bar. Multiple TVs with Basketball, Olympics and even Hockey. Service was super good!! Mackenzie was great, smiling the whole time while it was packed! All the food came out Hot!! Love that! 

One con? As is becoming the norm in SB ( maybe everywhere?) for Burgers etc it's pretty pricey for food. $5.00 Mai Tais on Tuesday makes it better but expect the food portion to be higher than you expect when you get the bill.  Here's a tip, go during happy hour   

Bottom line is I'll be back & I'll glad there's a place for Happy Hour in La Cumbre plaza again."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,The food is so good! They could work a little harder on customer service. However the food is worth the wait. It's perfect for a late night family dinner on those nights that you just don't feel like cooking. Oh and make sure you try the islands seasoning. You will not regret it.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"1st timer and I'm not impressed. 
Ordered a Big Wave with cheese 
Containing Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles & mustard

It was made well done but so dry it was tough to pass without water. 
I would probably recommend medium in that case. 
Had to go to in n out the next day to satisfy my cravings.  

Also got a tortilla soup as recommended by the waitress which was good. 

Partner got the Hula medium rare
Containing  sautéed  mushrooms, Swiss, lettuce, tomato & mayo.
And garlic cheese fries. 
He enjoyed his meal very much."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I am just so upset. My family and I come for happy our, sat at a table, ordered off the happy hour menu, and then receive the bill with all of our happy hour items at full price! I want to clarify our server was good as was our food. The manager comes by and tells us that we didn't sit in the ""correct"" section for happy hour since we got a table, to which I told him that there were happy hour menus on the table. Why put a happy hour menu on a table that isn't in the right section for happy hour?? Super misleading. And then he tells us that we should have told our server we were ordering off the happy hour menu first, and he refused to give us any kind of consolation. We only ordered items off the happy hour menu, and ended up paying $30 more than we expected because of this ridiculous and misleading policy or whatever you want to call this. He was just unsympathetic to our situation. The host even walked over to us afterward and apologized to us because he overheard and knew we got screwed over. This was incredibly upsetting and I'm just appalled with how this was handled."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"We live a few blocks away and were pleased with our first few visits, but recently things have gone downhill and corporate needs to pay attention to their customers and fix things. 

Most recent visit on Saturday 6/1/19 at 5pm, i figured I would slip into the bar and get takeout for my family, a small order of 2 burgers and a kids meal. I waited 45 minutes to receive the food. The restaurant was half empty, and there was some talk among regulars about the restaurant being understaffed and also overwhelmed with takeout / delivery orders. 

Aside from the long wait time, we ordered the burgers medium and received well done, actually more than well done. Food quality has declined and was very mediocre. 

I won't get into details but there are other signs that indicate corporate is more interested in the bottom line than a high quality experience for their guests. Good luck Islands, we hope you can turn things around because our hopes were so high!"

March 23rd. Very interesting conclusion to my experience that day; management at Islands sent me an email within two hours expressing their concern and were serious about making me feel that they were going to make sure none of their guests would have a similar experience. They assured me that the manager of this Islands would reach out to me. That never happened. You be the judge!!!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Great food , slow service. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone especially because they have veggie burger option which is great but if you have somewhere to be this is not by any means a fast or even reasonably timed dinner or lunch spot. If you have grumpy friend/ family members who complain a lot maybe don't bring them here because you won't hear the end of it."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I used to visit islands quite a bit when my daughter was little-we loved the cheese fries and kona pie.

This islands is definitely more spacious and bright than the islands I remember but the food is consistent and tasty!

Im still a fan of the tortilla soup (not so much the cheese fries) and my boyfriend loves the burgers.

Service is always fast and friendly!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"We have been going to Islands Venice/Marina del Rey for many, many years because the food is good, but also because of its laid back, beachy, surfer and tropical ambiance which makes it a great casual place to stop by in flip-flops for a drink and a burger. Now that Islands SB opened, we couldn't wait to check it out, and the place didn't disappoint. However, and though the food is still abundant and delicious, there are a few differences from the other location: The SB location looks more like a sports bar than a ""beachy"" casual restaurant. We don't know if flip-flops are allowed, but we are happy to announce they DO welcome DOGS! For that alone, it continues to be one of our favorite places in California.
Now, about the food and drinks, yep, the quality is still there, and I would have given them 5 stars, but alas, I ordered the Pineapple-teriyaki burger with veggie patty, and though the overall burger and fries were as good as always, the veggie patty was rather bland and no taste at all. Perhaps Islands should try and use the same patties vendor that The Habit uses on their veggie burgers, those are the tastiest ever! (by the way, The Habit's veggie burger is approximately half the price of Islands, but The Habit doesn't have a slick bar  ;-) -So, six in one hand and half a dozen on the other, depending on the mood. Welcome to SB, Islands!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,My friend and I came into today to try this place out. We walked in and were greeted by the hostess right away and within seconds taken back to our booth. The hostess asked us how are day was going and she also asked if it was our first time here which it actually was. Once we were seated our waiter came over I forgot his name but he was really nice. The hostess had told him it was are first time here and he gave us free fries on the house which was super kind of him. After looking over the menu For a bit the manager came over and introduced herself which is really awesome and I did not expect that! She was very sweet and really seemed to care about our experience which I appreciate as a customer. Once we looked over the menu I decided on the Hula burger which was delicious! I also go a side of onion rings which were yummy! Over all me and my friend really enjoyed our experience and we will be back again!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"As others have said just an overpriced burger joint. I had the bluenami burger with promises of blue cheese crumble, I had to actually tear the burger apart to find the blue cheese, did not match any of the 15 pictures of the burger in store. My partner had a fish bowl it was ok,but the raw broccoli was tough to get down. The worst part was the kids menu. Three chicken strips for $7.50 no sides, no drinks just three chicken stips come on??? Only positive was the place was clean."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I came here because the Santa Bárbara hype of a new burger spot in town, however I must admit that the food was mediocre. The burgers were bland, the fries were obviously not trying to be discreet about being frozen. My boyfriend & I instantly regretted not going to habit down the parking lot. #regrets 
The customer service from our waiter was great that's why it got two stars, the food just isn't comparable to habit or even in & out."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Islands is a great addition to La Cumbre Plaza. I'm so glad we have another option to dine at in this area. Hopefully this chain restaurant will be a survivor and keep serving good food. 

The staff here was very welcoming and our waiter Matthew did a great job tending to us throughout our visit. The restaurant itself has been transformed into a beachy tropical vibe and the patio area looks great! 

For my order I couldn't decide between the Malibu burger which has applewood smoked bacon or the Hula burger with mushrooms. Thanks to my friend we decided to split the burgers and share that way we had the best of both worlds! 

The Hula burger was my fave! They didn't skimp on the shrooms and it was full of flavor, juicy and delicious. Get the wheat bun! 

The Malibu was served picture perfect but It was loaded with too much raw onion for me which i had to take out, but if i order this again I'd ask for grilled onions. I didn't realize it only had mustard and no mayo. I'm not a huge mustard fan but overall the burger was still good and I'm glad i could try it. The fries were just ok but they are bottomless so that's a plus! 

For drinks we had the Mai Tai and I have to say this was the best Mai Tai I've had thus far. It wasn't too strong as they tend to be and it wasn't overly sweet. It was made perfectly! I especially loved the crushed ice. They have Mai Tai Tuesday specials for $5 bucks! Regular price is close to $10 so take advantage of that special. 

Happy Hour on the weekday is 3pm-6:30pm an extra half hour  longer than Lure and starts again at 9pm to close. The outside patio area also includes happy hour prices. 

Overall I had a great experience here and only time will tell if the service will remain 5 Stars and the food served as fresh and delicious as it was on my first visit. Looking forward to my next visit to try more items on the menu."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I'm happy that this place is still seating guests. I came here predominately because I wanted to watch the Memphis vs Portland 8 seed battle and the staff was so nice and helpful. 

The manager came out to put the game on for me and my friend and I just relaxed here as we were leaving Santa Barbara back to Los Angeles.

We ordered a couple burgers and a side of green bean fries. Everything was great and I left satisfied.

I've never been here being from the mid south. I gave this place 5 stars because the service was great. They are working hard through COVID 19. And the food was exactly what I paid for and it was flavorful and fresh.

I'll be back. One day."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I've been a fan of Islands for a long time, been to several different locations around California. So when one was opening up in my home town I was excited.

However, the 4 times I've been to this location since it's opened, I've had my order messed up 2 times. This is a minor inconvenience at a fast food place if you're eating alone, but at a sit down restaurant in shared company with friends or family it can really sour your outing if you have to have your meal remade. By the time you get your food, your entire party is done eating. Even worse if you're hungry. 

In the first instance of getting my order wrong, I ordered the Big Wave burger. It comes with mustard on it and I asked for no mustard (I don't like mustard). The burger ended up having mayo on it instead (I REALLY don't like mayo). The Big Wave burger as described on the menu is not supposed to have mayo. I did not ask for mayo. At least the waiter was nice, apologetic, acknowledged the kitchen made a mistake, and that she would have another one made. 15~ minutes later my new burger arrives, after my party has already finished eating. The burger wasn't even comped. 

In the second instance of getting my order wrong, once again I ordered the Big Wave burger. Again I asked for no mustard. This time, mustard was on the burger. And once again, I point it out to the waiter, it was sent back, and I wait another 15 minutes for my food while my party finishes theirs. This time they ended up comping the burger.

The staff is very nice, courteous, and attentive, the food is good, but a 50% chance of getting my order wrong, it's just not worth it. I do not think I will be revisiting this location."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Had a very nice experience here on Saturday night! Yet another new burger joint that took us forever to finally get to. My wife ate at Islands Restaurant in Huntington Beach a while back and kept raving about it. We had a short, 10min wait for dinner with our family of 5. Décor is Hawaii/surf (surprise); lots of fun stuff, surfing videos, etc. for the kids to look at.

Wife and I started with a couple of Mai Tais that came out quickly, and took us back to Kona...yes, they have a full bar! Beer selection is good as well, with a number of local brews. Limited, yet diverse menu, including lots of burger combinations ($12-$13), plus some seafood, chicken, salads and ice cream goodies, all at reasonable prices. Four of us ordered burgers and one, chicken nuggets. Everything came out quick and hot. The burgers were all good sized and flavorful. I ordered the ""Malibu,"" which happened to come with mustard on it; it worked perfectly for me. Fries were delicious too and tasted dare I say, ""fresh,"" not frozen. Brandon, our server, rocked it by accommodating our every customization and drink refill. We also ended up in a nice, 10 minute conversation with the manager, who was doing the rounds and creating a pleasant all-around vibe - found out he's local too!

My rating of an establishment or service reflects both my expectations, and total experience. For overall burger taste, yes, places like Mesa, Habit and Eureka have a pinky up on Islands, but Islands exceeded my expectations for service and an overall good time. And did I say they have a full bar? It's a much needed, laid back and family friendly breath of fresh air in La Cumbre Plaza."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Great restaurant!

We come to Santa Barbara often, but never make it this far up state street. We sat on their patio with our dog, they have heaters so we were very comfortable.

We came during happy hour, so I had the happy hour mai tai. Not the best, but good for the price. We had some happy hour apps: buffalo chicken mini quesadillas - good but very spicy, and the Kalua sliders - very good! They also brought us a plate of fries because we were first timers. At first I though ok fries, cool, but there's fries are SO GOOD! Highly recommend! 

Then we were still a bit hungry so we shared the break point burger. AMAZING. Then to finish we shared the kalua our, very good! 

On top of the great food and atmosphere the best part was the service! From the host to the waiter, to the multiple managers who checked in with us, everyone was incredibly friendly and accommodating! I highly recommend."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Five start food and five star service. For a casual restaurant the quality of service is bar none. Heidi are server was the sweetest cutie pie in Santa Barbara and was an overall an excellent waitress. Will return for happy hour next time. A phenomenal establishment!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Ambiance/decor:  very good inside and out on patio.  Like a trip to the islands without leaving town. Beach/island/surfing vibe. Booths and tables. Also seating at the bar. 
Food: I had 2 fish tacos - grilled mahi mahi piled into sturdy corn tortillas along with shredded cabbage and a drizzle of a creamy sauce. Wedge of fresh lime topped each taco. Salsa served on the side as well as nicely seasoned ranchero beans.  
Free chips and salsa if you add the Islands app to your phone.  
Service: very good; frequent refills on iced tea - last refill was offered in a take out cup which we gladly accepted. 
Dog friendly on the patio. Water brought for our dog without asking."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,I love coming in here to eat! The food is always so delicious and the atmosphere and service is wonderful every time.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Food was yummy, it was either this or Panda Express since everything closed so early. Would give the burger a 7/10. Food arrived in about 30 minutes, the fire outside was nice."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,While playing in the light and shadows of burgerdome hoopla do your happy dance for Islands. Lots of competition in this market and consistency is key and that's what is happening here.  At this level it's a staff situation to make or break. Fun time burger names. VeRy good onion rings and good tasting burgers bookended by bottomless soft drinks. Sign me up Nancy.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Over priced ok burgers. Our waitress asked us how we wanted them cooked. We said medium and we got well done. The habit serves better food at a third of the price. We spent $50 for two burgers , a small beer and a shake. Not worth it."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Island's is highly underrated. If you get their burgers, you get bottomless fries. ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS get at least one. Or ur soft. But ya, it's kind of pricey for a burger place, but there are a few other burger places around here that have similar priced burgers. Island's just has bottomless fries. That's what sets this place apart from the other over priced burger establishments"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Great service and great food.  Brooke our server was pleasant and helpful. Made great recommendations from the menu.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Despite being busy, the staff was courteous and attentive (kudos to our waitress, Summer!)  We ordered the Luau tacos and the China coast with a Mai Tai.  The drink came out quickly, the food soon after.  Water glasses were always full. 
We also spoke with the manager Rick and appreciated the fact that he took the time to chat with us even though it was incredibly busy.  
So happy that we finally have an 'Islands'!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Haven't been to an Islands in about 4 years and glad I went to the one in uptown!  This is in a great location in the la cumbre plaza by starbucks. 

We went in on the first Sunday football of the season and it wasn't too packed! There were PLENTY of TVs and the bartender really caters to which teams are there and pays attention. He did an amazing job taking our orders quickly and coming back to make sure we had beers every time. The place was clean and service was great. The owner even walked around and talked to everyone making sure they were having a good time and seeing if there was anything he can do.

We had some of the happy hour items (all day Sunday!) and they were delicious. Had the hawaiian sliders and it was really good. They were even kind enough to separate the pineapple as I don't like savory with sweet. We also had the chicken nachos and those were amazing.

Overall a great experience and we'll be back to watch more football or just for lunch or dinner!

sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Went by Islands to get my free bday dessert. It happened to be happy hour so we stayed and had some snacks for dinner. My husband got the pulled pork sliders and I had the sriracha wings. We also shared some cheesy fries. What a feast!! 

I LOVED the sriracha wings and my husband really enjoyed the sliders. The cheesy fries were very good. 

My favorite, of course, was my free bday KONA pie!!  It was HUGE and a delicious treat to celebrate my birthday."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Although Islands is well known to be as a very busy restaurant, the day I went in wasn't. I was greeted by a very amicable Host and was sat down at a nice location outside. A few minutes later, I then noticed an odd smell that did not sit right with me. I examined my surroundings and noticed the heaters, which then occurred to me that it may be a gas leak. i addressed the situation to my server from which they said that they would address it to their manager. The manager, whom I believe his name is David, came out and said he didn't smell anything. Unfortunately, this smell was becoming persistent and unpleasant. And for a slow day, it took my server at least 20 minutes to come to my table to ask me for drinks and another 15 to bring them and ask for my order. I was on a bit of a time crunch that day and had also addressed that but I suppose that they didn't care for my time. After taking my order, I had to wait another 30 for them to bring my meal out. I then asked myself, What the Heck could be taking so long for my server to bring me my food in such a slow day?! Anyways, Food was great, service not so much. Managers should be doing routine checks on anything that has pipes or anything that could affect the customers experience at such a lovely restaurant. I also hope that they improve their serving time when it is a slow day. I'd understand if it were busy however, as mentioned, it was slow. Godspeed to those who also went through this unfortunate time."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Service always seems to be a challenge and when there is no hostess present you can be left standing at the entrance for a long time and then some random person will take you to a seat and throw a menu at you and then you wait again for a very long time until you are seen. Who knows where the manager is at this time of the late evening but still...
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Disappointing, again. My family and I used to love this place. The food is good but recently the service has consistently gone down hill. This is mostly due to their new french fry procedure. You are supposed to have endless fries. However, what really happens is that you get fries for an appetizer and a dessert because it they can't manage to get them to you during your meal... you know, with your burger."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Beer selection is weak, no dark beer
Ranch dressing is very thin, almost watery
Burger bun is weak, falls apart

Service is excellent, food and beer needs improvement"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,The sweet potato fries are everything!!!! The food here is really good and whole wheat buns are a good addition to the meal. I got my burger well done and it was everything I could ask for. The service here was really good and they were helpful. Overall this was a good experience and a place I would come back to. They also have take away or delivery which is a nice option if you cant make it to the restaurant.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I've been here a bunch of times but tonight was worth a review.  

Thank you John for the phenomenal service!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Updated: went here on a Sunday at lunch time with a party of eight. We got seated right away and had an amazing server (John) who was very attentive. We had our drinks and fries constantly refilled. The bus boys and server did a great job clearing the table as needed. The manager came by to check on us two or three times. The food was also good! I loved my Impossible Burger. Delicious! The fish tacos were good as well. My grandmother put some hot sauce on but that's just her preference for all food. I appreciated the kids menu as well since it offered a good amount of options. Overall a great time! We will be back. 


Great happy hour! Monday through Friday until 6:30pm. Good selection kids meal. Burgers are huge! Love the onion"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"The service was great. The menu has changed a lot since the last couple of years I've been here. They don't give unlimited fries with the burgers anymore(not that I really liked their fries). Instead they added two different french fries, one being the truffle fries and another kind which we did not order.
I got my usual, the pipeline, and added an extra patty thinking the patties were small because it's been a long while since I've been to Islands. The only disappointment I had with this burger was that there wasn't a lot of chili on the burger. I also ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer and it permeated truffles which was amazing. The truffle fries are sprinkled with truffle oil and Parmesan cheese that comes with a truffle aioli. My only disappointment with the fries for me personally was it being over cooked to the point where it was no longer fries but potato chips(in all honesty I like soft light fries...don't get me wrong I also like fries that are crispy on the outside and soft on in the inside but this was just chips).  Flavor wise it was on point even the truffle aioli was great. I just wish their fries weren't dry or potato chips. It's alway been a gripe of mine with Island's fries. I like that they also take the axxess card!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I should have read the other reviews before trying Islands. Now that I have read the reviews I now know this place is hit or miss. Our meals were a miss. My house burger was swimming in muster that was applied by the kitchen. So much mustard it was running out and down the sides. The kitchen must have caught this and tried to wipe it off only to smear it all over the bun. I took a bite and muster squirted out. I opened the burger up and scraped it out, but the bun was still drenched. My side salad had the same problem only it was dressing. The lettuce was swimming in salad dressing to the point that it wasn't green anymore but all white from the dressing. The next time the waitress came by and asked if we needed anything I complained about my burger and salad. She sent the manager out who when was told about my burger commented he had watched me scrape out the burger. Then went on to say ""Islands is known for putting on allot of sauce on the burger including muster"". He did admit the salads were way over the top with dressing and would talk to the kitchen about that. I guess they are still being trained? Good for them but l loose oh well I'm never going back. 
They did knock off $4 oh wow. Over $40 for 2 beers and a crappy experience."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"My friend and I decided to check this new spot out. I ordered the island fish tacos, while he ordered the steak tacos. We botch traded one taco so that we could try both. The island fish tacos were amazing! The steak was your average steak taco. I would go again but not switch out a taco lol. The margarita was fresh. All employees were attentive which is always a plus. Despite parking being hit or miss, I scored a spot pretty close bye! Woot woot."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Our dinner here was just great. Server was friendly and attentive. Food came out hot and how we ordered. We both got burgers but saw a few other things on the menu that sounded tempting for next time. I used to love their fries though and they aren't as I remember but who knows if that's my memory or what (their seasoning is still good). Fun place if you're looking for a sit down more than just burgers burger joint.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"The music is way too loud there. There was also competing very loud rap music coming from the kitchen, which was unbearable. The food was very average. The french fries were not worth wasting calories on. On a very positive note, I had an excellent server, even though it seems like there isn't much management on duty. I would skip this place next time."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Update: 
We went back recently with the family and had a wonderful dinner, the service and food was back up to par and the family dining atmosphere is always a plus! Coloring books for the kids for the win!

Previous review 
Bummer the service is so poor at this establishment, we love the food and it's great for family dining! We had a recent experience where our server was more interested in hanging out chatting with the regulars then actually being a server. We watched refill after refill head to their tables and never once were we asked if we would like refills on our drinks. We had to ask for everything from napkins to cutlery to ketchup and even then it took multiple trips to bring us everything. When we were finally able to flag our server down for refills the meal was basically over. These days it's not worth it to diner out if the service is going to b so bad."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I've been to Islands a couple of times in the past few months, and I'm growing quite fond of it.  It's a nice place to head for when you want to watch a game while grabbing a bite and a brew.  To date, my friends and I have never had trouble finding seating when we come here :-)

The interior makes you feel like you're on an tropical island. The venue is filled with surfboards, hibiscus decor, and plants. Prepare to embrace a tropical vibe!

Last time we came, our friendly waitress brought me three draft tastes so I could pick the right brew to match my mood.  With that done, I was craving a burger so I consulted our very helpful waitress again, and I decided to take her suggestion and go with the Maui Burger.  That comes with onion, lettuce, tomato, Swiss, mayo, and guacamole; I got it on a wheat bun and it came with a side of fries.

Before I was ready for my second beer, the burger arrived and I dug in - it was very good!  The Swiss was nicely melted, the guacamole was fresh, and the beef patty was cooked medium rare, exactly as I had asked.  It was flavorful, juicy, and nicely seasoned.  With a second brew to keep it company, I was one very happy camper!

Islands is a place that I've been enjoying and have no problem recommending, especially if you want to eat out somewhere while watching a game.

I'll be back!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"It's a fancy Habit with table service and twice the price. If the service was better and the food was at a higher level maybe, but as it was I doubt that we'll be regulars. Simple requests were forgotten as the servers were congregating and talking rather than paying attention to the floor. 

The place does look nice though."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Place was amazing!!! 

The help was awesome!!

very good."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Great service !  We stopped on our way up to Santa Ynez -Solvang for lunch.  We go to the Islands near us but the service here was top notch & very friendly.  Our server Heidi was great and we enjoyed our lunch break.  We had a chips and salsa with queso and the fries that was with my son's burger came out piping hot a little ahead of time & they were hard to resist!  I had the Siracusa honey wings which were pretty spicy and overall pretty good.  My wife had the toucan burger with a side of chicken tortilla soup.  We all ate for about $25 before tax & tip so it was a great lunch for a great deal.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"I've been coming to this great spot for a few years and decided to finally put a review thanks to a Great experience I had recently:

Patrick helped me out on the phone and in-person. He went above and beyond and reassured me everything was okay and helped me with some complications that came up with my order by using the mobile app.

Had I known Islands restaurant had a mobile app, I would've used it to build up my points for a while already, since any time I pass through Santa Barbara, I make sure to stop by here every time for a great meal made the way You want it.

My go-to is the Kilauea burger (with the veggie patty) and a cool Breeze smoothie...and maybe some wings!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Absolutely awful. Not only did the keep me waiting for 35 minutes for a simple order, they kept saying ""it will be ready in 2 minutes, we're waiting for the hot fries."" Well the fries were cold, along w my undercooked burger and they forgot the hot wings I ordered. Needless to say I won't be coming back again..."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,Great burgers cooked as asked! Great service! And plenty of TV's to watch sports! And it's not a la carte.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Although I had gone to Islands a few times in the LA area when I was younger, I hadn't gone to one in well over a decade, so I decided to give this one a try.  The burger is just as good as I remember, with a sweet and tangy teriyaki sauce, pineapple ring, and soft whole wheat bun.  I also really enjoy the fries at Islands, and everyone who knows me knows that I'm really picky about fries.  I just really enjoy what Islands has going on, and I'm glad that there's one close-ish to me.  I'll definitely be going here more when I'm able."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Two words, one name. Brandon Raven. The BEST service that I have gotten at a restaurant in a very long time. He always checked in on us and had the best of attitudes. 10/10 recommend and request him if you can, for the gatsby of experiences!!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Been coming to Islands since it opened and always enjoyed their food and bottomless fries. However, my family and I went today and were told everything is now a la carte. We figured the burgers would be around $9 instead of the usual $13.5. But found out the burgers were only dropped $0.50. So now you are paying the $13 and have to pay $3 for French fries. This is way too much money for what you get. You compare it to Red Robin where you spend around $12 for a bigger, better burger AND bottomless fries. I don't like the ""better ingredients"" excuse. If you want good ingredients and quality burgers go to ""Mesa Burger"". Most people can care less. Good ingredients is cool but not worth this price hike. If they needed more money, I would suggest increasing the overall price and keeping the bottomless fries part of the menu. It sucks paying almost the same price (-$0.50)  but now have to pay $3 for fries. Waste of money, and will no longer recommend this place to friends and family."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"We've given them a try several times, and we always leave with the same opinion: This is just an overpriced burger joint. You pay more for the atmosphere than you do for the food. 

On our last visit the fries were cold and bland, and the burgers were average. The salads are good, though, and the drinks are decent. The service was polite and attentive, no complaints there.

Santa Barbara is full of places serving a gourmet burger, so I doubt we'll give Islands any more chances to impress us."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,Looks like they listened to my feedback. Permanently keeping French Fries separate from the burger would have ended the business. Glad to see the change.
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Okay, LAWD JESUS where to start where to start..

It was a family members birthday and we decided to go to islands! We were a group of 15 and they were pretty accommodating, so that was nice.

As we waited to be seated, some of us were at the bar ordering drinks before dinner. I ordered 2 DBAs, and a tequila soda with lime. Got the check.. and WHAT the actual F?  $37.00?!?!? I tipped 3 dollars for a total of 40 dollars for 3 drinks! Oh hellll to the no. 

I also noticed on a sign that DBA is on happy hour for 3.50 each..so IF I am correct. 2 DBAs = $7.00. So I'm guessing my tequila soda was 30 dollars. Fair enough. ‍

When the bartender finally came around, I asked why my three drinks came out to $37.00 he said, ""I'm not sure actually."" Gave me and itemized receipt with the ""correct,"" amount of now 27 dollars. Which technically is still 9 dollars per drink..still not right... I look a little closer and.. they had charged me extra tequila! 7 dollars more to be exact. Asked the bartender again.. and again he says he doesn't know why. He then figures it out, hands me a receipt for 18.00 which seems right. Perfect. 

We sit down, food comes out fast, which is great. My girlfriend sitting next to me asks me if my burger tastes weird, I said no but she asked me to try hers. The bun on her burger didn't taste right, so she requested a new one. Waiter asked what was wrong with it, and immediately got her a new plate of food. Another waiter came up and asked her what was wrong with it, and she apologizes and says her food will be out shortly. THEN a manager comes out, asks her AGAIN what was wrong with her food, she then replies, if you must know, ""the bun tastes a little plastic-y,"" which then the manager replies, ""DOES ANY ONE ELSES TASTE LIKE PLASTIC?"" Way to embarrass her! Funny enough, she owns a food business in the Santa Barbara area. I just found that so Incredibly rude. 

This was a Friday, it's now a Tuesday and my refund is not in my account. I honestly don't care to deal with it, or go back. I'll just walk over to habit down the block if I'm ever craving a burger."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"The service is always good, the servers have a good attitude, and the food is consistent, great-tasting and fresh.
We're also super impressed with the safety measures you've been taking at this location. Great job Islands SB, you guys are really doing great."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Well we ate here first time and I did not like it. My hamburger was dry and no flavor. The milkshake was really thick and drank with a spoon. The salad dressing was soured. Maybe it was a off night, but $48 for burger, shake, wings. I really wish the City of SB stepped up and opened up a PF Changs or Cheesecake Factory in the replacement of this resturant... the server was very good!!"
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I would never go to a restaurant called ""Islands Restaurant"" to get a hamburger.  Would you?  Somewhere in our ever-changing culture is a sub-group of people who will eat ""Hawaiian-anything"".  This case, it's Hawaiian hamburgers.  I was a tag-along on this ""search and destroy"" mission to find a hamburger.

This is a Southern California chain that has not spread to the North.  (I'd like to think we of the North are more discriminating in our hamburger tastes.)  The decor is bright, clean, cheery and Hawaiian.  The staff are young, attractive, cheerful and very helpful.  I've always fancied myself as ""dysfunctional"", so the Islands Restaurant atmosphere gives me the creeps.  I'm looking for an older woman with that rough ""I've been around the block"" look to make me feel at home.

I ordered the Point Break Burger because there was a little card on the table suggesting as much.  The drawing on the card looked very attractive and I enjoy blue cheese.  The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare.  Just as I like it, and it was not a cheap paddy!  Good ingredients.  It's just that I didn't like it.  It was laborious to plow through that burger.  ""Now I'm eating food."", I thought.  ""Very soon, I will be satiated and I will stop eating.""  My favorite places in the North, I think, ""God this hamburger is sooo delicious!  I hope this moment never ends!"". 
 Islands Restaurant is a different experience.

Later, I asked our waiter if they had ""cheese burger"" on the menu.  He cheerfully showed me.  Everyone who works there is very enthusiastic.  (They must pay them well.)  I think it's called ""The Big Wave"" with cheese.  Remember when Starbucks would try and force you to say ""Venti"" when you wanted a medium coffee?  I never did.  It was like they were taking a piece of my soul by forcing me to use their language.  A cheese burger is a cheese burger.  Calling a cheese burger ""The Big Wave"" is like telling me if I want a cheeseburger, I have to wear a funny hat.  My friend Jim use to tell me I overthink a lot of things.  He says overthinking makes life more difficult.  I think Jim is just as miserable as I am, so what?

This is a place for young families.  Young families who like to drink.  They have a full bar and feature tropical drinks served in beer mugs.  Hawaiian drinks like Lava Flow and Sunset Colada.  Maybe that's what makes Islands Restaurant so popular.  Where else could you get a drink like that?  

The staff are very good to the little babies that sit in little chairs made for that purpose.  The staff will bring sliced avocado and steamed broccoli for the babies.  The service is very good.  The manager is on top of things.  She came around to make sure things were good.  The little babies were throwing their broccoli on the floor and eating the avocado.  Life is good at Islands Restaurants for the infants.

Islands Restaurant doesn't get an amazing review from me because it isn't for me.  It is for a younger crowd.  Sometimes it's just exhausting for older people like me to be around so many younger people.  Everyone moves fast, talks fast and are so helpful.  I'm use to asking for a spoon and getting it after I finished my first course.  Here, that spoon may materialize seconds after it's asked for.  That can be scary for we older people."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,The best service! Everyone there is so nice and helpful and the food is always delicious! Thanks Islands!
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,positive,"Good, comfortable spot to enjoy a nice meal. 

I enjoy the tropical vibe that this place offers. They have a number of deals which are accentuated by their smartphone app. Simply check in for perks like a free appetizer or be the first to know about a promo item. 

The various cocktails are basic but good, exactly what I'd expect from a chain restaurant. I've ordered a few of the sandwiches and they have all been exceptional. The buckets of fries are massive and are definitely meant to be shared! Good deal overall. 

Service has been good for the most part. The staff are friendly but there has been more than one occasion where my table is either forgotten or the employees are just spread thin - these instances were prior to Covid. Either way, they are always accommodating and make me feel welcome. 

Check this spot out if you're in search for a solid sit-down meal without a line."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Pretty good Burgers the staff is always nice but the burger was almost $18 and came with no fries! Omg that is kind of alot. I got a burger to go and the bag seemed really light so I looked and saw no fries when I asked the staff , said the burger came without fries ,I asked if that was a new thing and they said yes you had to order them separately . I can understand ending bottomless fries as that could  be abused but giving no fries at all especially for a $18 burger makes it not really worth it."

sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"First time @ Islands this past weekend for my father's birthday and I have mixed feelings.

Positives: 
1. Very friendly SERVERS
2. Buffalo Wings are BOMB
4. Clean & Tidy

Nehgatives: 
1. Beer mug was chipped when brought to the table
2. The female running the food to the tables was RUDE
3.  They messed up on my Burger. I had asked for white bun instead of wheat bun because of health reasons, but they ended up making it on wheat & when I asked if they could switch out the bun, they instead took my burger to the back and then brought it BACK STILL ON THE WHEAT BUN & brought me the white bun on the side, forcing me to REMAKE MY OWN BURGER that I had SPECIFICALLY requested they substitute the bread. 

Overall, I was super annoyed the entire time due to their lack of assistance and wait time. In the future, I will not be eating in as I had a disappointing experience my first time. I will be sharing my experience with friends/ family members so they know what to expect when dining here."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Since recently opened, been wanting to try the hamburgers here, so yesterday (Sunday)it finally happened.  As soon as we Parker noticed that it would be busy as there were many people standing around the entrance.  We walked in the girl took name and number and told us she would text us when they had our table.  We decided to walk around the mall to kill time.  Even though it was 15-29 minutes the wait, it didn't seem that long.  We got our text came back, and were sited.  A girl came shortly took our drink order,  and shortly brought our drinks.  Since we needed more time to place order we asked to come back.  Few minutes later she did come back, meantime we went to bathroom to wash our hands.  Bathrooms were clean, and no line to use.  Back at our table few minutes later our food arrived.   It was kind of busy but not overwhelming, eventually we were able to ask a server for refills on our drinks, but those drinks took a while to come back, it was just water and soft drink. So don't get why it took long time.  We both got hamburgers, my daughters burger was missing the tomato, and we had both salads as our side, but then everyone around had fries and decide to order some too.  First took long time to get attention of server, then it took way too long to get them to us.  I felt I was just sitting with half my burger eaten waiting for fries.  Burger tasted ok, I got Maui burger, the avocado wasn't a real good taste, maybe it's not fresh avocado, idk it just didn't taste quite right. Finally we got our fries, they were good but not to die for as other reviews.  Not salted enough, and a bit on the soft side.  The service was lacking, there were many servers just hanging around the front, and not quite giving attention to tables, I finally got attention of one to get our check, had the exact amount of cash so just left it behind.  I was afraid if I use credit card would take too long to get checked out.  Overall food ok, but service definitely lacking."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"I am just so upset. My family and I come for happy our, sat at a table, ordered off the happy hour menu, and then receive the bill with all of our happy hour items at full price! I want to clarify our server was good as was our food. The manager comes by and tells us that we didn't sit in the ""correct"" section for happy hour since we got a table, to which I told him that there were happy hour menus on the table. Why put a happy hour menu on a table that isn't in the right section for happy hour?? Super misleading. And then he tells us that we should have told our server we were ordering off the happy hour menu first, and he refused to give us any kind of consolation. We only ordered items off the happy hour menu, and ended up paying $30 more than we expected because of this ridiculous and misleading policy or whatever you want to call this. He was just unsympathetic to our situation. The host even walked over to us afterward and apologized to us because he overheard and knew we got screwed over. This was incredibly upsetting and I'm just appalled with how this was handled."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,"Food was not good, fries were super salty and burger was not tasty either. Their mix drinks are way too sweet. The server was friendly and professional."
sxuv5uZU15UHGT_HB1xYxQ,Islands Restaurant,American,negative,Nothing really wrong with the food. Burger was done the way I ordered it. Good option to be able to get a whole wheat bun. Fries were hot and crispy-little too much salt. Margarita was normal. The problem was nothing was fabulous. And with their prices it should have been. Spending almost $30 for a basic margarita and basic burger I would expect something to knock my socks off. I was disappointed it didn't.

My Long Island iced tea was delicious and Matt recommended the sweet potato fries which paired perfectly with the drink. I would recommend islands with Matt to any of my friends and family"

""We had soooo much fun!""
""Beautiful venue!"" 

These were just a few of the comments from our wedding reception on March 14, 2015. We had approximately 90 guests. Everything was PERFECT!!! Carol and her staff are consummate professionals in every way. I highly recommend this gorgeous venue."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,I worked closely with Angie at Rincon Catering for my wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo. They are the mandatory catering company which initially could feel like a compromise in going with the venue but they are actually awesome! I had a family friend who had heard great things and they definitely delivered. Angie was super helpful every step of the way. They did a large tasting event and it was a perfect way to choose appetizers and entrees as well as decor. We heard the food was some of the best most people had ever had at a wedding which is every bride's dream to hear:)  I would highly recommend them!
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"The Rincon Beach Club was the PERFECT location for our wedding reception venue. Carol made everything a breeze planning wise. My fiance and I just had to pick and choose what we wanted the place to look like, and Carol exceeded expectations. The food was amazing, the decorations so beautiful, and the photo booth so much fun! With all of the stress that comes with wedding planning, this venue made it so much easier, it is pretty much like a built in wedding planner. The Beach Club is a great indoor/outdoor space that offers a gorgeous and intimate setting, where guests really feel at home. All of our family/friends are still raving about how much fun our wedding was. Thank you so much again Carol, for making it a perfect day."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I can't say enough good things about the Rincon Beach Club and the staff at Events by Rincon. Every time I work an event that Events by Rincon has anything to do with the end result is always a successful event with satisfied customers. The owners of this business, Marc & Carol, are two of the most humble humans I have met, they have clearly poured their entire life savings & hard work into creating this amazing wedding event service. It is a must that you go with them when in need of catering and or a beautiful venue."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,Rincon events catered my wedding in March of this year. They did an excellent job!  Angie was so helpful from beginning to end. The food was amazing and the staff was very professional.  They even made us a meal to go and boy was I hungry when I got home.  Can't say enough about this wonderful company!
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Rincon Beach Club is one of the most beautiful places in all of California! Having attended numerous weddings and events at Rincon I can say there is no better place to have your event. With incredible food, great service and an amazing ocean view I would recommend this venue to anyone planning an event in The Santa Barbara Area."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We chose Rincon Beach Club for our venue, because of their delicious food, intimate atmosphere on the coast, and because a lot of the work was done for us by Rincon, which helped manage the stress levels while planning a wedding. Our guests kept complimenting the food saying that it was ""the best they've ever had at a wedding"". We loved that there were several options that Rincon could provide for decor, table arrangements and settings, ceremony styles, as well as different options of food service (e.i. buffet, served dinners, passed hors d'ourves, specialty cocktails, cake, desserts, etc.). Caitlin and Carol were so wonderful in helping us create our dream wedding, and really let us put our personal touches on it. They worked hard to collaborate with our vendors to make sure everything ran smoothly on the big day. Everything was so professionally executed, and all of the staff were very helpful and friendly, making us feel so comfortable. And again, we can't say enough about the food; there were so many options at the tasting, and all of them delicious!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My cousin had her wedding here the last weekend in July and the place was great. There is plenty of parking out front, so no need to bring cash for the valet. 

The ceremony took place right before sunset and it was spectacular. The staff efficiently converted the space that held the chairs from the ceremony into the dining area. We had dinner under the stars and although it was a bit chilly, they did provide heat lamps. I conveniently switched place seating so that I was right next to one. Lights were strung throughout the trees which added to the romantic setting. 

The food was OK for a sit down dinner, appetizers were better than expected. The open bar helped keep the party going. The dance floor was indoors and the DJ did a really good job all night."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My company had a luau retirement party at the beach club and it was amazing.  Eloise, Sumner and the entire Rincon team were exceptionally easy to deal with and beyond accommodating.  No detail was spared.  My colleagues are still raving about the food: chef carved prime rib, fresh ahi and shrimp at the Pacific Rim station, cedar plank salmon and of course local delicious wine varietals to accompany.  From the planning stage to final execution RBC was fantastic, right down to the leis and mini pineapples!  We'll look no further next time we have an event, and I suggest you don't either."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"Recently attended a weeding and here. I don't know anything about the price, but it is a pretty nice location and the food was pretty good for a wedding buffet dinner. The location is right off the 101 which is convenient, but it is right next to the railroad tracks and the the trains going by are very loud and obnoxious. The outside seating can get chilly, but they do have heat lamps.Last but certainly, not least...half way through dinner there was an overwhelming odor of sewage that invaded the area for nearly ten minutes."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We had our wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo and Angie did an amazing job coordinating everything! Angie helped to make our dream wedding come true. We don't live in the area so it was very reassuring that she was there to help us. Our guests kept telling us that having our wedding at the zoo was so fun and different and it ended way too soon!

Zoo Catering Services by Rincon also provided us with amazing food! Our guests couldn't stop telling us that it was some of the best food that they've ever had at a wedding. We couldn't have been any happier with how everything turned out. We highly recommend the Zoo and Zoo Catering Services by Rincon if you want to have a memorable and exciting wedding day!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My husband and I could not have picked a more amazing place to get married.

Just after we got engaged, my fiance and I were both working two jobs.  I was applying to graduate school and the thought of also having to plan  a wedding on top of everything else we had going on was daunting, to say the least.  When we stumbled upon the Rincon Beach Club, it was like a miracle.  The facility already provided the food, the tables, the chairs, the dining ware, the lighting, the sound system, the service and the guidance!  To top it all off, the outdoor setting and ambiance is exactly what we were looking for.  Perfect for the summer evening wedding we were picturing.

When the big day came, Melissa (our on-site coordinator) took care of everything.  From coordinating the ceremony to reminding me to eat my dinner, she thought of everything so my new husband and I didn't have to.  Her experience and attention to all the details that were important to us made the night exceptional -- for us and all of our guests.  Even my impossible-to-please, has-a -critique-for-everything friend said it was the best wedding he had ever been to!

I highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a budget-friendly venue in the Santa Barbara area that caters to the patrons that need more than a little help planning an event.  Their reputation throughout Santa Barbara is well known for having delicious food and excellent service.  If I had to plan my wedding all over again, I'd still choose the Rincon Beach Club as my venue."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We want to thank everyone for the planning and production of our wedding on July 12th. It was absolutely perfect & we could not have chosen a better venue for our big day.
 
Through all the planning Caitlin (our planner) was very attentive. She was always willing to meet with us, brainstorm different ideas, and offer support. Our wedding required many details, but Caitlin executed our vision perfectly. When I arrived the day of the wedding, I was thrilled. The centerpieces, table settings, head table, chalkboard signs, ambience, etc. was exactly as I had pictured it would be!
 
Caitlin & the Rincon staff was very supporting and re-assuring the day of, we did not have to worry about anything! The ceremony, reception, & vendors were all organized and managed by Caitlin and the Rincon Team. We were able to relax and have fun without any worries. Throughout the whole night Caitlin would check in to make sure everything was going as planned- it was more than we could have asked for!
 
Our guests just raved about the Rincon Beach Club. Everyone loved the food, especially the cupcakes! Guests commented on the little details the beach club offered (sitting areas, string lights, decorations, etc.) as well as the intimate feel it provided.
 
We could not be more thankful and happy about choosing Rincon Beach Club for our wedding. I highly recommend Rincon Beach Club for any wedding! They exceeded my expectations."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My sister had her wedding here, it's gorgeous! Not much to look at from the outside but inside it's lovely with a beautiful bar and a lovely outside garden dining area. We had the dinner outdoors, beautiful flagstone, white lights in the trees, it looked like a fairyland. Delicious food and very helpful and intelligent staff. Fairly priced for the Santa Barbara area."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Rincon Beach Club was an AMAZING venue and catering service for our July 2016 wedding. We couldn't have been happier with how everything turned out. Carol, our coordinator and owner, is AMAZING to work with. She knows the business and makes great suggestions along the way. We booked this venue about a year and a half out and Carol walked us through each step of the way. From the group tasting event all the way through the day of our wedding - everything and everyone was professional, courteous, open to suggestions, and so accommodating. Carol made the day go extremely smoothly. She worked with our vendors, organized our ceremony rehearsal, and helped us pick a very complimentary menu. Many of our guests have told us that this was the best wedding venue they've ever been to. Not to mention, the food quality is TOP NOTCH. Everything from the cocktails, to the appetizers, to the plated meals and dessert was perfect, tasted amazing, and was visually appealing. I can't express how wonderful our experience with Carol and Rincon was. The only downfall is that it's all over now, which makes us very sad! Thank you for everything Carol and Rincon!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We had our wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo in May, with Rincon Events catering/coordinating it.  The entire day was beyond our expectations!  Angie Chaves (the coordinator) made sure everything ran smoothly and was perfect down to the last detail.  She was so helpful and made the entire planning process (mostly) stress free!  The food was spectacular and the service was impeccable.  We had guests from all over the country, including LA, NYC, and Miami.  Many of them told us it was the best wedding they had ever been to.  I cannot recommend Angie, Rincon Events, and the SB Zoo enough!  They made our special day more than we ever dreamed it would be!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,Just went to a wedding here this past weekend and was blown away by the place. It was absolutely gorgeous! The soft lights strung overhead gave the whole place a really pretty atmosphere. The fire pit and fireplace seating areas made lounging before and after dinner feel more homey. The food was also delicious and the signature drinks were really fun. The whole wedding was run really well.
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Two years later and I'm finally getting around to writing this. Rincon Beach did the catering for our wedding in 2009. It was an offsite event, and there is not a bad thing I can say about them. Marc (the owner) came out to our ranch (the venue) and we sat down and discussed everything. He put my dad's mind at ease about the financial part of the wedding. We worked with Melissa through out the entire planning process and she was such a delight. I felt like she was one of my friends by the end of the process. 

We decided to add the ceremony planning package (I'm an event planner so I didn't want to be doing ANY planning during my own wedding). This was by far the best decision we made. Unfortunately Melissa couldn't be at our wedding. Which was OK, she kindly handed over her assistant Jaime. Jaime was just as great as Marc and Mel. I felt like I didn't think about anything about my husband the day of. I would look at Jaime and she would just tell me what to do. In a very kind and not pushy way. She was perfect. 

That's my review on their service...now let me get to the food!

People are STILL raving about the food. We had a steak, fish and veggie option. All of which I heard were amazing. Of course I didn't eat much, but I had the steak and it was perfect! One of my vegetarian friends said it was the veggie option she had ever had at a wedding. 

My favorite part was the appetizers. Since we were taking photos during the cocktail and appetizer portion of the event. The caterings staff brought the head tables large plates of appetizers so we could try them. I have never seen this at an event, and I thought it was brilliant. This goes back to their wonderful service!  My friends still rave about the chicken won tons. 

All in all...Rincon is the BEST. Thank you for making our wedding perfect! I honestly don't have a single complaint....and I'm pretty picky."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"BEST WEDDING EVER!!!!  We just got married at the Santa Barbara Zoo and it was catered, organized and executed perfectly by Angie at Rincon Catering.  Absolutely everything was amazing.  The process was easy, the choices were simple and our wedding turned out better than I could have ever expected.  The day of our wedding, I got to enjoy and relax.  I had so much fun and will never tire of the glowing compliments I received about the venue, the food and of course, Angie!  Thank you so much!!  It was a beautiful day that I'll remember it forever :)"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Seriously, get married here!!! I could not have found a more perfect, gorgeous and fun place to have our wedding. The grounds of the venue are so intimate and romantic. The Rincon Beach Club has tons of character with the garden, the patio, and the two fireplaces. 

The staff is all about customer service and helping to ease any stress of wedding planning. We worked with the owner, Carol and wedding planner, Cait. Both of these women were absolutely fabulous to work with. Whenever I had questions or concerns, those two solved them.  Cait and Carol are both so detail oriented, that whatever I forgot to do, they did. Cait added the flowers to the cake and it was gorgeous. Her taste is impeccable. 

Our guests have been raving about the wedding venue and how welcoming the staff was on our wedding. day. We have gotten so many compliments about how delicious the food was. Even our vegan guests said they never had such a great meal at a wedding! 

On the day of the wedding, everything just flowed effortlessly and perfectly. It was my dream wedding."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Best wedding service you can ask for!  I got married this past March.  My fiance and I decided early on to keep with the mantra of beautiful, mellow, and fun.  Basically a big yet classy party.  Melissa, our planner, helped us along the whole way.  In going with the big party theme, we had quite a large guest list, and she and the Rincon staff were so patient working with us on our estimate, tweaking things here and there as needed, to stay within our budget while accommodating all our party wishes at the same time.  No compromises necessary, it would be our dream day.  Of course, there were a few hiccups along the way to the big day.  Suddenly we were a month out and in need of a minister.  No problem! Melissa hooked it up.  ""Oh, and you still haven't picked your flowers?  We can help, and we have a great local florist to recommend.""  March rolled around and we were all ready for our beautiful beach ceremony and party to follow ... and then the rain came!  One week out and all plans out the window.  And suddenly I realized though we hadn't set out for a beach-themed wedding, the beach ceremony had steered us in that direction, from the music to the decorations, ah, what to do!!!  Thankfully, Mel came to the rescue.  Once we'd decided to can the beach ceremony and go for a heated tent in the courtyard, she took care of EVERYTHING else.  ""Worried about the beach decor?  Gone.  Want to take beach pictures anyway?  Sure thing!""  They held the reception for us while we hustled with our bridal party during a break in the storm to the nearby beach, freezing our butts off but the pictures turned out gorgeous.  I can honestly say I didn't experience a single moment of stress or anxiety that entire day, and many of our guests told us it was the funnest wedding they'd ever been to.  In the end we got our big, mellow, beautiful party and couldn't have been happier, or more in love."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Working with Rincon was the best decision we made for our wedding.  Carol is a pleasure and Marc is charming.  We had 160 people at our beach wedding and everyone had the best time!  The food is PHONOMINAL.  I just can't say enough about that.  We choose stations, which everyone loved.  We are Jewish but the most popular station was the pork station, specifically bacon on a stick.  You can not go wrong in any way!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Absolutely AWESOME.  For the value, you will not find a more beautiful place to get married.  You can get married right on the beach or in their stunning courtyard.  And, they take care of EVERYTHING.  So easy to plan.  Mel and Angie are also terrific coordinators.  Food is delicious.  Many guests said it was the best wedding they have ever been to.  Can't say enough good things...."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My wife and I got married in a garden ceremony at the Rincon Beach Club in July, and had the most PERFECT experience imaginable. Carol, the owner and in-house coordinator, was an absolute godsend. She guided us through the planning process, helping us to pick vendors, structure our ceremony, and make decisions about the wedding day. Carol is so friendly, knowledgeable, and responsive - she made the stressful wedding planning process feel so much easier!! From hosting an incredible tasting event (at which we got to taste test all of the potential food and drink options) to answering our millions of frantic questions throughout the past year, Carol was our wedding fairy godmother. 

Our wedding weekend was beautiful and perfect. Many guests have told us it was their favorite wedding of all time. The Rincon Beach Club venue is beautiful - surrounded by flowering hedges and fairy lights, the garden feels intimate but not at all cramped. It's so nice that there's indoor and outdoor space (and a fireplace!), so people can choose where to hang out. Carol did a great job of directing guests, soothing frazzled family members, and taking care of any and all issues before they even reached us. Our guests keep telling us that our wedding had the perfect ratio of structured time to unstructured time - we have Carol to thank for that. It was so helpful to build a program off of her suggested schedule. 

As environmentally-minded folks, my wife and I decided to serve a vegetarian buffet (knowing it might be a controversial move). The food was SO amazing, it's one of the top compliments we've been getting since the wedding! Even our carnivorous friends and family raved about it. 

As a lesbian couple, my wife and I felt extra grateful to have found such a wonderful venue and coordinator. Throughout our planning process, we were always aware that some wedding vendors might be unfriendly. Working with Carol and her team, we never felt any tiny inkling of that. They were excited to help us incorporate the wedding traditions we liked, and never made any assumptions about what we did or did not want. We wish there were more local resources for gay couples planning a wedding. If any are created, Carol and her team should definitely be added to that list! 

To summarize: we could not have picked a better venue, caterer, or in-house coordinator. We're so grateful to them, and HIGHLY recommend them!!!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Working with Rincon Beach Club for my special day was such a pleasure.  Carol and her team had the event planned down to the minute, which helped cut down on other vendor costs per hour, (dj, transportation, and photographer, etc).

The food was incredible and customer service was top notch. I can't find anything that I would have changed. I would highly highly recommend Rincon Beach Club to any company or bride looking for help in planning an event. 

I had the wedding of my dreams and stayed well within my budget thanks to Rincon Beach Club."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Where do I start? Rincon beach club gave us the wedding of or dreams! From the very beginning when we were just shopping around to even after the wedding, Rincon has made me feel very special. We were on a bit of a budget, but Melissa didn't make us feel like that would impact the outcome at all. Melissa is extremely honest, straightforward, punctual, and very experienced. She's got a great eye for style, and I was very lucky to have her. I have to show my appreciation to the owner, carol, as well because she was so incredibly nice and helpful with everything.  I did the Friday late night hors doveurs reception, and it was a party! Everyone told me it was the most fun wedding they've ever been to.  The ceremony was on the beach during sunset, which made for a gorgeous backdrop. I didn't have to worry about anything during the wedding because Melissa and her crew had it all covered.  It was even the little things like making sure I had a glass of champagne in my hand to giving us our food to go (note: you will be too busy to eat at your wedding). The food was absolutely delicious. I still have dreams about the sushi haha. The venue is nothing like anywhere else in SB. You  don't even need much decor bc the place is so beautiful on its own.  I wouldn't change anything about my wedding, and I really hope I get the chance to go there again! Thanks Rincon for the beautiful memories we will cherish forever!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Amazing ALL the way around! Food, service, ambiance, weather and if you're a chocolate/peanut butter fan, they have a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie to die for. My wife and I were married here over ten years ago and we still have wonderful flashback conversations about how great this place was. The food they cater here, will hold up to any high end restaurant and their service is literally second to none! Last but not least, getting married in their beautifully landscaped garden with the pacific ocean as a back drop, was incredible! You can't go wrong having any event here...TRUST ME."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I recently attended a wedding at this venue and I have to say I was really impressed.  it is an incredibly beautiful setting, the food was amazing, the way everything ran was just perfection.

DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Rincon Catering is incredible to work with.  We do all our corporate events using Rincon - and all we have to do is choose the menu, and collect the RSVPs....They do everything else...the sound, the lighting, the decor, the setup, breakdown, service, etc.  Very little stress for our staff.  I have used them as an event planner as well, and they are fabulous!  I coordinated a memorial celebration and the event was so special, beautiful, affordable and memorable.  I give them 5 stars!  All the staff is impeccable, personable and positively delightful - especially Marc and Sumner!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I was lucky enough to be able to attend my buddy Reid Y.'s wedding here this past weekend and it was absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!!

Every detail about it was wonderful and I even told my friends it felt like a fairy tale wedding. 

From the outside you wonder where you're going because all you see is a BBQ joint and a surf shop but in between those is a little door and once you step in you are taken to a gorgeous area where there was a bar set up, couches and tables to lounge at, a fireplace and then the ceremony set up was perfect. At night it turns into a magical place with lights everywhere. 

There is also an indoor area for dinner and dancing. Speaking of dinner, the food was AMAZING!! Probably one of the best foods I've eaten at a wedding. The appetizers they passed around were seriously addicting and then the food stations were delicious, gourmet sliders anyone? 

I really loved the whole atmosphere of this wedding, not stuffy at all, very chill and I can't say it enough, gorgeous :-)

Congrats Reid!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"From the moment we walked in Rincon Beach Club we were greeted by warmth and hospitality. After visiting numerous venues we accidentally came across Rincon Beach Club through Yelp. Right after dinner we drove there and knew that this was the place for us. We scheduled an appointment and after the first meeting we were in love! Every venue we had visited made us feel like an ""appointment"" but Carol and Marc made us feel like we were at home. It was all the little things...The way they had a box of desserts as a gift for us (and their desserts are BOMB), or the way they dressed up the venue for a mock wedding for us that brought me to tears. This couple is really such an inspiration because they are doing what they love. Every step of the way they strive to make your event so special. It's because of this passion they have helped us make our wedding a reality. 

Guests could not stop talking about how great the food was and so many people told me they had 2-3 plates of food. All our desserts were gone at the end of the night! I love this catering company from the bottom of my heart! They host events at their venue and are also able to cater to the venue of your choice.

Also I LOOOOOVE Carol! She was also our wedding planner and she was so professional and calm throughout the process. We could seriously call her whenever we needed help....that included family problems, venue setup, wedding processional, wedding crashers and emotional issues. I had wedding OCD and she even gave me a time line so I wouldn't freak out. She was always the deciding factor when my fiance and I couldn't make a decision. Rincon Catering MADE our wedding!

I'm so glad we found them! I highly recommend them and if you have any doubts free to personally message me!"

DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Outstanding! We have used this place for several functions and most recently for a 90th birthday party for my partner's grandmother.  The facility itself is a perfect setting. The real star is the catering.  For this last event we had salad, roasted veggies, the best roasted potatoes ever, and a flavorful, tender tri tip carving station.  There was a Brie en croute and cheese tray with crudités for apps.  The star of the meal was the ice cream sundae bar.  Hand dipped local ice cream (McConnell's) served in small mason jars with lots of toppings.  Also of mention was the coffee station withal argue variety of Torrani syrups.  For a nice event in the Carpinteria/Santa Barbara area, this is the place."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"The Rincon Beach Club is an amazing venue with an incredible staff to compliment it. Marc and Carol run a great catering restaurant with excellent food and wine. Melissa is the best in the business at creating the wedding of your dreams. She knows how to make a bride feel extra special on their special day. I am not sure what kind of experience Jake R had but Melissa is an amazing person. If it wasn't for her our wedding wouldn't be possible. I can tell you that we were on a tight budget and thanks to Melissa we are able to have the wedding of our dreams.  I just recently went to a wedding that cost $50,000 and that wedding didnt compare to what Melissa can do with quarter of the cost. If you want your wedding to be a special day that will be talked about for years to come, you have to see Melissa. If you're getting married in the southern california area I would strongly consider the Rincon Beach Club."

The atmosphere and set up at the beach for our ceremony was beyond gorgeous, and the reception at the Beach Club was so everything that we wanted for a night of entertainment and dancing! The food was amazing, the layout was perfect, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure that our guests were well fed and hydrated! ;) The wedding day went off without a hitch and I truly couldn't have asked for a better experience.

We had our reception catered/serviced by Rincon at the Santa Barbara Zoo on 8/20/16 and it was amazing! We live out of state, and had the pleasure of working with Angie, who was constantly pleasant and answered all of our questions promptly. 

The food was AMAZING! Even though my husband and I went to the big group tasting and selected the menu for our day, we were impressed by the quality and tastiness of the food. Our guests also loved the food, we still get compliments about it! 

The tables/linens, lighting, and cabanas made the space even more beautiful than we could have imagined. The entire day was perfect, thank you!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We just had our wedding at Rincon Beach Club in April and I couldn't have been happier with how everything turned out. The owner and our coordinator, Carol, was so helpful and responsive from start to finish and she made the process a breeze! This is a great all-inclusive venue so that you don't have to stress over having multiple vendors for everything from chairs to linens to decorations, you just get to choose from all of the great decor options that are available to you as part of the package. We had so many compliments from our guests on the beauty of the venue as well as the awesome food (we chose a buffet). An added bonus is the food tasting event that you get to attend with four other guests prior to to your wedding so that you have an opportunity to really check out all of the decoration options in detail and try as many options for food as you would like. I would highly recommend this venue!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I think about how much fun I had here for my wedding all the time.  The details that were covered, the attention to my wife and I, I really had no idea what was next. Melissa (our coordinator) wanted us to experience our wedding as guests & we were. It was such a special day and if anything went wrong I have no idea because it was handled. Thank you Rincon and everyone who made it so special!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We got married at the SB Zoo in August 2019. I cannot say enough good things about Rincon. We got so many compliments on the food and amazing service. I'd also like to shout out Angie Chaves who was our event coordinator at the Zoo. She was so helpful and easy to work with during the whole process. During our wedding, she kept us on time and everything was on point!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I don't even know where to begin. We had a garden wedding and reception at Rincon Beach Club on May 19th. It was better than I ever imagined. Melissa was absolutely amazing!!! We decided to have a small wedding, but this place is perfect for small or large weddings. Melissa allowed everything to go by so smoothly. My friends kept saying I seemed so relaxed throughout the wedding day and week before and I owe that all to Mel.  She took all of the stress away not only in planning the wedding but also on the wedding day. My guests still keep telling me how much they LOVED our wedding and especially the venue. The food was almost too good to be true. I have blunt friends and they had nothing bad to say about the food. It was soooo good!! If I could do it all over again, I would still get married at RBC in a heart beat. Melissa and RBC made our day absolutely perfect!!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"If you want an amazing event with beautiful decor, delicious food, and ZERO stress, you need to go with Events By Rincon. I handle the events for my company and I use Rincon every single time. We will never use anyone else. Every single employee is reliable, knowledgeable, and personable. The absolute best... hands down."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"Amazing food and great location.  The wedding planner Melissa was rude, however, which sucked."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Our guests still rave about our wedding!!! 

We were married at the Rincon Beach Club back in 2008 and it was, in a word, magical! The day of the event was absolute perfection and still, seven years later, we often get comments from our friends that were there how great it was, how much fun they had, and how good the food was. Not only is the venue itself beautiful, but the staff is just outstanding! From the moment we first toured the facility, throughout the planning process, till the last guest left, the staff members were friendly, attentive, helpful, and professional. They really went above and beyond for us and I highly recommend their services! We are forever grateful."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We had our wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo and had Rincon cater it. Every rental item, from the dance floor, to the lighting was taken care of by Rincon. 

Angie was our planner and she was excellent!!! She made it so easy on us and we never stressed out about anything! The Zoo is an amazing venue for a wedding- it has a lovely tropical garden and an ocean view. The crowds leave in the afternoon and the Zoo is private for your wedding guests to enjoy. The Zoo only permits Rincon Catering to cater for them and they do a great job. They think of all the details that busy brides overlook (trust me, I am an anal planner and even I forgot some things that Angie luckily had already thought of). She helped us plan our menu, made sure I ate dinner at the reception, and helped with every vendor and every detail. I can't say enough good things!!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Growing up in Santa Barbara, I had literally never thought about the Zoo as a wedding venue but it truly was the perfect location. 

The Palm Garden and Hilltop's natural beauty and stunning vegetation was absolutely gorgeous to showcase Santa Barbara at its finest for our out-of-town guests. The weather was perfect and our guests were able to enjoy 360 degree views of the mountains and the ocean and as the bride, who wouldn't want to get married under majestic palm trees? The reception area is completely set up for large weddings with on-site bathrooms, power source, parking options, and is conveniently located so guests can easily stay Downtown, Waterfront, or in Montecito. 

The great thing about having a blank canvas is that you can truly bring in any type of decor that you want and we had so much fun with all of Rincon's cabana, lighting, chandeliers and overhead and table fabric options.  Rincon's food was absolutely delicious-we had so many guests come up to us to mention how good it was. You can also bring in all of your own liquor with no corkage fee which was a great bonus!

I had been involved with all of the planning but when I got to the hilltop that afternoon and saw everything set up, it truly took my breath away. Angie and her team captured our wedding vision so perfectly and made everything stunning. Angie was fantastic-she worked seamlessly to execute our requests and many changes along the way in conjunction with all of the other vendors and on the big day, even found my wedding vows which I had misplaced seconds before walking down the aisle.

I wanted all of our guests to have a fantastic weekend filled with great food, great drinks, dancing and tons of fun-thank you for making everything so perfect Team Rincon!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We had our wedding here in September and I could not be more happy with the way our wedding came out.

I would and have recommended this venue to everyone I know. It is such an amazing place and it offers everything so you don't have to worry about all the details. Melissa Younce was our coordinator and she was AMAZING (as well as her assistants)! She was so helpful with everything, and she did a very good job with dealing with my crazy family... I was so grateful to her. So thanks Melissa!

The food was amazing, we did the ""H'or dinner"" option (I think that is what it is called) and all the guests loved it. It is basically a bunch of food stations where people choose what they want to eat and how much of it. It really was fun. Like a big cocktail party. (they do offer sit down dinners also)

The service and staff were amazing, they were very helpful and nice...loved them!

The location is amazing, (we had the ceremony and reception there) we chose a garden ceremony but they also have the beach and zoo option if you would like. What is really cool is they can accommodate for a really large party (up to like 250 or 300) if you would like or a small one. We got a photo booth through them and all the catering and tablecloths...anything you name it. And if they didn't have something they gave you a list of vendors they would recommend that have done their venue many times such as DJ and Flowers, etc.

If you want to get married in a lovely location with nice people...this is the place to do it."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I just had my wedding here a few days ago. My husband and I wanted a wedding around the Santa Barbara area and Rincon Beach Club fit what we were looking for from start to finish. We now live out of state and planning the wedding with the staff from the Beach Club lessened the stress of having to coordinate from so far away. The Beach Club staff members, and especially its owner, Carol, and planner, Cait, were warm, helpful, accommodating, accessible, and truly understood what we envisioned for our wedding.  Rincon Beach Club has pretty much everything you need (ceremony and reception coordination, decor, food, etc.) in such a beautiful setting! It has a beautiful outdoor garden and indoor area and is situated right next to the beach. I could not have envisioned a better wedding and more importantly, our family and friends also had a blast! I have to mention that the food served was also delicious! 

We hope that other couples discover Rincon Beach Club and have the time of their lives as well. We keep talking about how we wish we could relive our wedding (it was so fun!) and the wonderful service Rincon Beach Club provided definitely played a huge part in that."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Carol and her team at RBC did an amazing job to make our wedding reception absolutely wonderful -- they went above and beyond to make our night wonderful. All of our guests were so impressed by the venue itself, the wonderful food, and the great beverages that no one wanted to leave! Carol made the planning process so easy and stress free for us, and she was so accommodating to our requests and concerns. Thank you to the entire Rincon team for making our special day beyond incredible!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"If I could give Mark and the Rincon Team 10 stars I would!  They planned our event for 150 people with grace and attention to detail.  Everything was beyond perfect, the food, the decorations and the service.The event was unique to us and did not look like any other I have seen.  They made it so very special and our guests had a wonderful time. I will certainly be using them for my catering and party planning again!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Many thanks to Angie and her team for an amazing wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo! So easy to work with and communicative. We had some non-traditional requests, but Angie understood the vibe we were going for and we ended up with such a great party. Angie paid particular attention to the fact that I hated buffets but didn't want a stuffy service either. She made it all work particularly with my weirdness in mind. It didn't hurt that the food was delicious. :) Next time I get married, I will totally go to her again, lol."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I cannot say enough about Marc and his amazing Team at Rincon. Professional, courteous, understanding, AMAZING! From the incredible food to the way they transformed the Temple social hall into a NY night club (on a modest budget), I could not be more impressed. It was the attention to every single detail that allowed my husband and I to be GUESTS at our own party. Thank you Rincon, you made our sons Bar Mitzvah a memory that we will forever cherish. See you in 2 years for our daughters Bat Mitzvah! We HIGHLY recommend you to ALL!!!!! Dani & Bret Stone"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My reviews are always stupid and have nothing to do with the food or anything.  But this time, I have to be straight forward.  This place rocks!  I did the unthinkable this past weekend and took the plunge.  What was I thinking?  Oh, that's right, I wasn't.  First off, our coordinator Melissa was freaking awesome.  I think I have ADD, and she was patient enough to put up with it.  The staff and customer service here is outstanding.  The bartender even saved the last Coors light for me.  Everything pretty much went as planned and I thought it was perfect.  Our ceremony was outside and was set up perfectly.  I wish I knew how to download some pictures from facebook to post, but I'm too stupid to do it.  

Our photographer Cherry Thomas kicked ass.  I totally dug her style.  After the ceremony, she took us to the beach and took some nice shots right on the beach and also on the train tracks adjacent to the beach.  

As for the reception, we chose something called hors dinner, which was basically all you can eat hors d'ourves for 2.5 hours.  I think most of the people enjoyed it.  My favorites were the Kobe beef sliders. Open bar?  For sure.  Beer and wine was free, all other drinks you had to pay for.  

Cerritos All Stars were the DJs.  They did a dope job.  Thanks Mike and Ben. 

I also hired Rockstar Shuttle to take people back and forth from the reception to the hotels.  We didn't want anyone driving drunk.  They were great and very affordable.  

I know this review was supposed to be only for the Rincon Beach club, but I couldn't help it and had to write all about the experience and everyone that participated.  

Special thanks to Smitcha B, Michelle T, and Lea D for taking the trip out to share this special day with us.  You guys are awesome."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I cannot imagine a better place to get married! From booking them to the last minute of our big day, we felt supported and cared for by the entire staff! Our coordinator, Eloise, was so helpful and responsive throughout the entire process and made it as stress free as possible! The grounds are gorgeous with so many natural beautiful flowers and succulents! It was wonderful to have so many things made available for our ceremony and reception by Rincon, you get so much included! Everyone there went above and beyond to make sure EVERY DETAIL was taken care of, and we appreciated all the small touches to make everything seamless! The food was INCREDIBLE, we had the buffet chicken / tri tip, and we got comments from all of our guests on the quality of food and service. Could not recommend them more! Thank you Team Rincon for helping make our day unforgettable!!! We really felt like part of your wonderful family which made everything all the more special :)"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I absolutely never write Yelp reviews however, the Rincon Beach Club is truly worthy of a great review. 

A rare gem in the Carpinteria/Santa Barbara area!!! My husband and I had our hearts set on having a intimate beach wedding in the Santa Barbara area. We viewed some traditional hotel venues in Santa Barbara that could offer a beach wedding however, we were quickly won over by the Rincon Beach Club and the welcoming staff. Having a destination wedding can be stressful for all parties involved but Carol continuously put my mind at ease by recommending fantastic local vendors and great advice. She is simply AMAZING!  

On the day of our wedding Carol along with her staff handled absolutely everything. The wedding party was given clear and concise directions as to where to be, all vendors where aware of our program timeline and everything flowed effortlessly. It was so refreshing to be able to really enjoy our moment without all the stressful details of a wedding. :) Additionally, all of our guests kept raving about the food, the venue, the ceremony, etc.!!! 

Literally, everything about the Rincon Beach Club is exquisite! 

Lots of love to the wonderful Rincon Beach Club Staff! :)"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"What an amazing day thanks to an amazing catering company!! We got married at a private venue and Rincon Catering was fabulous! They did our food, our rentals, and our day of planning, not to mention much, much more. Their professionalism and efficiency was top notch! We loved all the decor, the signage, and the way they put such detail into everything at the wedding. So beautiful!

We were so impressed at how clean the grounds were after the event. The home owner said she had never worked with such a thorough company!

Our friends and family have not stopped raving about the food and the overall smoothness of the evening.

We cannot thank them enough for making our wedding so seamless and wonderful!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We just had our wedding and reception at the beach club this past weekend and we had an amazing, stress-free time!  

OWNER/WEDDING COORDINATOR:  Carol, the owner and our wedding coordinator, was so responsive and helpful throughout the whole process.  She made us feel really comfortable and wanted to ensure that our guests felt that way too.  We planned the wedding from Los Angeles, and Carol was more than accommodating with our (busy) schedules in terms of planning, tastings, etc.  She also always made herself available via phone and email.  We really appreciated her input and recommendations - she has been doing this for such a long time and has a ton of experience making sure your day goes smoothly. 

VENUE:  The venue was exactly what my husband and I were looking for - it's a really nice and  relaxed setting.  We had 200 guests at our wedding, but the venue still make it feel really intimate, yet spacious.  We loved the ambiance - string lights, natural greenery, and fireplaces.  In addition, the bar area is really cool and uses great edison lights.  

FOOD/DRINKS:  We got so many compliments on the food/signature drinks.  We opted for a buffet, and everyone (200 guests!) got served in about 15 minutes. Aside from the quick and great service, our guests raved about the food.  We opted for salmon and tri tip, and it was cooked really well.  

We're so happy that we were able to enjoy and relax during our wedding.  We highly recommend this place!"

The grounds were always immaculately kept and the service staff was always working hard to make everything easy on us.  They took care of everything.  We never could have made it through the day without you Melissa.

Thanks,

The entire team at the club is perfectly amazing, but a special shout-out to our coordinator, Eloise!  She went above and beyond on every front to be sure the wedding day was perfectly beautiful, balancing a litany of details, odd family dynamics (LOL!), our carefully constructed budget, a large out-of-town guest list, my very picky tastes :) and our daughter and her husband's desires.  The day / evening was absolutely a dream, and we only wished it didn't have to end. Thank you, Rincon team, for loving on us so well and giving our girl her dream day!  We love you, Eloise!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My husband and I got married at the Rincon Beach Club on September 29, 2018.  We had the beach ceremony and the reception at the club.  It was the most incredible, perfect experience, and we are already wishing we could relive it again!

The event space is gorgeous --it was able to easily fit our guest list of 200 people.  The cocktail hour space, dinner space, and dancing all flowed together extremely well. It gives off such a wonderfully intimate and romantic feel.

The reason we loved the beach club so much was not only because of the beautiful event space, but because of Carol, the owner of the club.  From the first time we met her, we knew that she made the place special.  She is so incredibly friendly and made us feel like we were at home, giving us some freshly baked goods that their catering company had just made.  She has a ton of experience with hosting weddings, and we have been SO impressed by her breadth of knowledge and how she was so on top of every little wedding detail throughout our wedding planning process.  We didn't need a wedding planner because Carol was our wedding coordinator. I felt like a lot of the typical wedding stress was alleviated because we had Carol guiding us though the process.

Carol was incredibly responsive to every email I sent and always had a thoughtful answer to my many silly questions. We worked with Carol for about 14 months leading up to the wedding, and there was never one time that we were frustrated or felt like we were in the dark.  Guests after the wedding told me that Carol came up to each table during the dinner to make sure everyone was doing well and that they thought it was such a wonderful touch.  That represents how much Carol cares about making the experience a perfect one.  

The food at the beach club was immaculate.  Multiple guests have commented to us on how it was the best wedding food that they have ever had!!  We had the tri-tip, the salmon, the ravioli, salad, and the potatoes, and I'm still dreaming of how good the food was. There was enough food available so that our guests weren't hungry after, which is also a common problem we've encountered at weddings.  Carol even had it planned so we were able to eat our cocktail hour food AND our dinner, which is pretty rare for most brides and grooms at their own wedding!

Between the event space, the food, and Carol, this was the most perfect wedding venue.  We are so grateful to Carol for making our special day so stress-free, perfect, and fun for us and all of our guests.  We would  highly recommend the Rincon Beach Club to anyone!!!!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Angie and everyone else at Rincon Beach Club was amazing to work with. Our wedding was in Santa Barbara, but we live near San Francisco, and they were very flexible and able to work with us on taste testing, going over SB Zoo logistics, and more. Yes, they do get busy so sometimes it took a while to hear back, but the end result was fabulous. Angie was so on top of things, whether it was figuring out the order of bridesmaids and groomsmen or when to cut the cake and start the dancing, or making sure we were able to eat and drink our special cocktail. 

And the food was delicious. It's been three weeks and I'm still getting compliments on the chicken and beef tenderloin. Angie also did a great job with the zoo. It was beautifully decorated, still intimate even though we had more than 150 guests, and a lot of fun.

Thank you Angie, Stephanie, and everyone else who worked so hard to make our special day so amazing."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,I couldn't believe how magical our wedding turned out at the SB zoo with Rincon as our caterer.  There is natural beauty in every direction.  Angie was our coordinator and she kept the wedding running as smooth as possible.  I couldn't imagine having the wedding without her there!  The food is incredible - many of our guests raved it was the best wedding food they had ever had.  We couldn't be happier with our choice.
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My husband and I got married at Rincon Beach Club a few months ago and were blown away with our entire experience with the venue. They really know what they are doing here. We looked at lots of venues in the Santa Barbara area and this one was the most well run by far. Our wedding was absolutely perfect and we cannot thank them enough for such a flawless night.

Carol is the owner and she is really hands on and on top of everything. She went out of her way to accommodate every little request we had and she made the entire process so much easier on us. She also owns the catering company (which has amazing food) so it was such a weight off our shoulders to have her be able to organize everything for us. 

This venue is also very reasonably priced. I have heard lots of stories from friends who have gotten married about their venue's ripping them off with hidden fees and I never felt that way with Rincon Beach Club. I felt that all of the added on costs were reasonable and actually turned out to be less than I expected!

Night of the wedding ran so smoothly. Everything was timed perfectly, food was served promptly and all of the staff was on top of it. I have a heavy drinking group of guests and the bartender was able to accommodate everyone in a timely manner with a smile on her face. 

Can't say enough good things about this venue. It is really worth every penny! Thank you guys so much!"

No bridezillas, no groomzillas, no stress, just pure joy. Angie Chaves was our coordinator and she is hands down the best person you could have overseeing the most important day of your life. She is responsive, she remembers everything, she goes out of her way to make everything you want come true. And she does all of this with kindness and humor. Being a bride is stressful and Angie puts all of your stresses to ease. She makes everything easy! Honestly who could ask for more!? Not only will you have the most turnkey experience planning at the zoo (they have almost everything you need to have an event here and they've done it a million times so they KNOW what they're doing) but the Sb Zoo is not your normal zoo, it is one of the most gorgeous places you can get married at in SB. All of our guests commented on the greenery and how lush it was. You can see the mountains and the ocean! And come on, you can have ANIMALS at your wedding!?? Flamingos, birds, giraffes?? Perfect place. Our guests raved about the whole experience and how unique it was. To top it off a portion of what you spend on your wedding here goes to support wildlife conservation and education. Get married and also do good! 

Best day ever. Thank you Angie for keeping everyone on time, worrying about all of the big (and small!) things and making sure we had the perfect day!!!!"

Their events have a way of sticking with you...from thier attention to detail to their delicious appetizers that I am still unable to duplicate! Whether a wedding, holiday party or business luncheon, the amazing staff go out of thier way to create an event you will remember and refer back to time and time again. I am still trying to find a way to get them to go 200 miles south and do my wedding! I truly miss the staff at Rincon Beach Club and the spectacular events I was able to participate in!

Our guests were floored- not to mention myself and my husband have been looking forward to their food since we booked the venue a year ago, just a great menu all around, and they take the time to perfect exactly what you want. Angie- our coordinator- was AMAZING! She has years of wedding experience and she shines on wedding day, and during the entire wedding planning process.

DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Events by Rincon is, hands down, the best combination of quality service & spectacular food I've ever come to experience. My husband and I decided to have our wedding at the Santa Barbara zoo early 2019 and worked diligently with Angie in coordinating the details over the course of 10 months for our October wedding.

First was the food tasting which was out of this world (advice: do not fill up at the slider or taco station - hold out for alllll the desserts). Secondly, the coordination and communication was an absolute breeze, especially given our overwhelming amount of questions (thanks Angie). Lastly, the overall service during the planning, the tasting and at wedding was perfect.

Angie helped us plan the perfect wedding to fit our taste, budget, and aesthetic. We even asked if it was possible to have black silverware (not typical of their choices) and they happily accommodated. Angie, my husband, and myself met days before the wedding to go over every single detail and I'm so glad we did; it settled all my nerves.

Setting up the day of our wedding was well planned and executed and we were never behind schedule. During the wedding, we received compliments from our our guests speaking very highly of the food and there was never a line at the bar. The day was perfect and I owe so much of that to Angie and her team at Events by Rincon."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"One word.....PERFECT! 

Our story is a bit confusing but fun....my husband and I decided to have 3 ceremonies 1. Vegas 2. Costa Rica, and the last one was at Rincon Beach Club with our family and friends. The third and last was THE BEST! We have Melissa to thank for it. She is amazing! She's so fun to work with, extremely organized and she knows her business well. She worked with us to stay within our budget, which we needed since we decided to have 3 celebrations, one of which was out of the country. We wanted a casual atmosphere but elegant at the same time. Mel and staff delivered! It was beautiful, relaxing, elegant and a lot of fun. Everything we wished for. Our guests couldn't stop commenting on the location and how well the evening flowed. Mel did an excellent job with timing the event from start to finish. I literally didn't have to worry about one thing. Mel worked with my friend, Erika, who created our flower arrangements and even helped her fill vases and set up, then helped her break down at the end of the night. She even allowed our furry son Kai, a Golden Retriever, to attend the wedding and reception. Of course, he had to remain outside, but it was wonderful to be able to have him there with us. The evening was exactly what we dreamt about and couldn't have been more perfect. I didn't want the night to end and even thought about having a 4th wedding! Kidding :)

Thank you very much to Melissa and her staff for creating a gorgeous event that we will remember forever!!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Carol is truly the most wonderful person! We went to a lot of venues but her service was stood out to us the most. She was so informative and patient with all our questions. On top of that,​ the venue was spectacular when we did a walkthrough​. Her pricing is definitely the most affordable and comes with so many things included!

Lastly, as we were walking out she gave us a box full of the most delicious treats! A huge box :)

Definitely​, recommend working with her for your wedding or brunch​/lunch events!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We ordered Thanksgiving Dinner for two and couldn't be happier! They are super organized, the heating instructions were perfect, and the food was really REALLY good. This was the EASIEST THANKSGIVING DINNER EVER!! Thanks for being there guys and doing such a STELLAR JOB!! The portions were beyond generous and I'm so glad we decided to do it this way this year!! Thanks Guys!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"Seriously . . .   I had to give you a one, but you deserved a ZERO.  What are you people thinking???  We had an appointment at 1 pm today.  We drove 3 hrs & Melissa was a no show.  Apparently she had another event that was more important.  She finally returned our call after 4 attempts.  This venue does not match  what you see on line.  Shame on you Melissa for your poor customer service!!N"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,Rincon helped us make our event a rousing success. The food and drinks were delicious and plentiful and Marc made sure that everything ran smoothly and on time. His staff is very professional and helpful.
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"Recently had our wedding here. The venue was gorgeous and the food was absolutely delicious! All of our guests had a great time! The score downgrade is attributed to the planning. I very much recommend planning an event at Rincon Beach Club however with the assistance of an outside planner who will make sure every detail is correct.
The communication among planners was inconsistent. One person would tell me one thing then I would receive different information a few days later from someone else. I would make an inquiry and often wait a week or so before a reply or have to call to get the issue/ concern addressed. It was a very stressful planning experience from the start up to 2 days prior to our wedding."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"I cannot say enough GREAT things about Rincon!! They are wonderful all around. They are there to help you with anything you need to run a perfect event. Their staff is friendly, knowledgable, efficient, and reliable. You can tell they are like a family.  Events by Rincon has you covered with everything you need for your next event; they have two venues (one in Carpinteria or at the SB Zoo, they can provide tables, linens, staff, AMAZING food, the list goes on. And if there's something you need that Rincon doesn't provide like flowers, the DJ, etc. Rincon has a list of reputable vendors that know Rincon and will be happy to help make your dreams come true. Marc and Carol, the owners, are wonderful people inside and out. The two of them along with their staff of fantastic wedding coordinators will be with you along each step of the way to your event. My husband and I got married there this past Saturday and it was absolutely perfect. I'm still receiving compliments on the food and the friendliness of the staff!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Rincon catered our wedding at Elings Park last summer, and they did a wonderful job. They provided the portable kitchen, the food, the bar package, and all of the rentals, and we were 100% satisfied with all of it. The food was great and the rentals (table settings, tables/chairs, archway for ceremony, lighting, etc.) were exactly what we wanted. The staff worked with us to make sure we knew what our options were and we were able to customize the details we wanted while having them take care of the details we didn't want to worry about."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"This review is long overdue, but more than a year after our July 2014 wedding at Rincon Beach Club, my husband, family and friends are all still raving about this venue. I honestly don't know what I would have done without the owner Carol and coordinator Caitlin. We planned our wedding from across the country, and she made the whole experience an absolute dream that went off without a hitch. 

From the delicious food to the rustic decor, our wedding was special and unique at a fraction of the cost of other Santa Barbara-area vendors. Carol even handled our flower centerpieces which helped save us hundreds of dollars. One of our wedding guests attended another wedding at RIncon a month alter and remarked how amazed she was at how each wedding seemed completely unique despite being at the exact same venue. 

Rincon also catered our rehearsal dinner offsite the night before, and helped us throw an amazing party on a very tight budget. 

Thank you to Rincon for throwing a wedding even better than we imagined."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"I wish I could say we had such a great experience with this venue. unfortunately this was not the case as we were not even given the chance  to find out. We spoke with Carol after doing multiple searches for inclusive wedding locations to provide service for reception as well ceremony in October 2015. Not only did it take some time to receive any responses to the inquires. Both my fiancée and I emailed the venue, I never received a call back, however my fiancé did. When we did receive the quote there was multiple areas that were incorrect. Looking bad now we shouldn't have overlooked it, but since this was the place that we had chosen to get married and we were so excited we did. We were told that we would not be able to complete a deposit as we would have to do this in person after we had toured the venue. since we live in Texas we had to arrange to fly out to the venue at the end of this month. We planned to pay the total amounts due at that time while not required. In the past week we've been in contact with Carol about menu choices as well as different aspects of the wedding that we wanted to have. As I had said before we we were told that because we were booking an off-season date it wouldn't be a problem for the date we picked (October 24 2015) and we moved forward with putting deposits down on photographers, out Florist, hair and make up as well as buying plane tickets for the end of the month to completely book our venue. We had also purchased our save the date  photos as well as ordered our save the date postcards with this date.  Our cake also been ordered and deposit also paid. You can imagine how excited my fiancé and I both were as to how well everything had been planned and how diligent we were being with making sure everything for wedding had been taking care of since we live out-of-state. 
What I'm sure you couldn't imagine is our utter shock and sadness when my fiancé called yesterday to confirm a couple things regarding our cupcakes as well other questions about sunset times etc. and Carol stated ""before you go on I need to tell you that this past weekend we had a couple come tour the venue and paid the deposit for the date that you had been planning for your wedding we had previously discussed.""
needless to say the conversation didn't proceed much more as my fiancé had to make a call to me to letting me know that our wedding wasn't going to happen on our date even though we had received our quote and asked multiple times about paying the deposit so this wouldn't happen. we didn't even receive a courtesy call on Saturday when this is happened to even let us know. my fiancé just happened to by chance have a question that required him to call the venue. I feel like this is the worst type of business Practice as well as customer service. I read so many reviews about making sure that you always get everything in writing and you can't trust anyone's word when they give it to you. This could not be any more true in this situation. I want everybody to know our experiences and what a hard lesson we learned and how much stress and sadness we feel over this situation and at a time that  is supposed to be the happiest since we are planning our future together,  we are scrambling to look for another venue and this is just very sad."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We hired Events by Rincon to do our wedding catering off-site, including having Carole Borowitz as our wedding planner. We are so glad we made that decision! Carole and her team are well known in the Santa Barbara area and were so helpful in recommending vendors, and ideas to keep our wedding stress-free. We booked with them in 2019, anticipating a 2020 wedding. With Covid, Carole was incredibly helpful in getting us two reschedules, including working with all our vendors to find new dates. She was a calm, organized, professional and sympathetic help to us as we stressed over Covid impacts. When our wedding finally arrived in 2021, Carole and Shoshana helped make it perfect. I HIGHLY recommend booking with this amazing team - they know their stuff, and take a huge amount of stress off the bride and groom, and their family. It was such a relief to have a professional in the mix to keep things running smoothly, and troubleshoot last minute obstacles, like our shuttle pickup location being under construction the day before the wedding! We adored working with Events by Rincon, and the food they provided was also delicious. Thank you again, Carole & team!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We got so many complements on the food from our wedding! We are still hearing about how good the Salmon and the carrot Suffle was. My husband and I are Pescatrian as well as Gluten Free and Rincon catering worked with all our restrictions and came up with a perfect menu that was with on our budget and surprised our guests with how tasty it was.
I could not have been happier with Rincon's service! Angie was amazing, she always had time for my bride freak out calls and with in seconds of speaking to her I was instantly relaxed and knew she had it all under control. She worked with my budget and my ideas and was full of helpful suggestions to amp up what I was brainstorming. I never felt any sales pressure or like I was getting pitched on upgrades of any kind so I was always able to trust her suggestions. She integrated the decorations that I had perfectly with the elements I ordered from them - everything was seamlessly beautiful!  On the day of I was so relaxed, I kept surprising myself with how much fun I was having. I didn't worry about a thing! My husband and I had so much fun and we were able to enjoy our guests. 
I was able to have my dream wedding, with everything I wanted and stay on budget! Rincon is AMAZING!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We were married at Rincon Beach Club on November 18, 2006.  This is ABSOLUTELY a top notch facility. From Melissa down to the servers, the QUALITY is surpassed by none.  After 5 years, our guests are STILL talking about how amazing Rincon Beachclub was....the food, the atmosphere, the attention to detail.  You will NOT be disappointed.  I'm SOOOO excited to be attending another wedding at Rincon this month because I can't wait to eat the food again and experience the magic of another couple's wedding at this lovely venue.

 I read Patty H's review and I honestly just DO NOT agree.  Perhaps there was a mis-communication or something, but Rincon Beach Club and Melissa are completely UNDESERVING of a one star. Melissa was voted by the people of Santa Barbara as the BEST wedding coordinator and that distinction, in my mind, has more weight that one person's review.  That is a collective vote by hundreds of people.These kind of reviews on Yelp can make or RUIN businesses. If you'd like more information from a happy customer from Rincon Beach Club, feel free to email me.   The venue is beautiful and so unique compared to all of these ""hotel banquet room style weddings"".     LOVE.RINCON.BEACHCLUB."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Rincon Caterers have been our ""go-to"" drop off caterers for a couple of years now. We can count on them to be prompt and complete in their deliveries even if it's for 25 people! They are responsive to our requests with delicious suggestions as well. 
Everything arrives fresh and is perfectly delicious! We highly recommend them!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"Rincon Beach Club is refusing to fully or partially refund any deposits even though Santa Barbara / Carpinteria is currently legally prohibiting weddings from taking place. They are incredibly inflexible regarding these circumstances. They offer the option for a later booking date, but are charging $5000-7000 more for a wedding on the later date. Their wedding contract and business policies are unconscionable. I would highly recommend that you avoid Carol and Rincon Beach Club at all costs and go with a more professional, fair wedding vendor."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We had our wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo and it was perfection! Angie with Rincon was our coordinator and they catered our entire food menu. Angie was amazing and super communicative. She made the process very stress free!!! The food Rincon provided was BEYOND. I have never had so many guests compliment  the food at a wedding before. It was fun, tailored to our personalities and incredibly delicious. We had multiple action stations with tacos burgers and pizza. Our guests could choose what they'd like! It was such an incredible event and made my wedding day so incredibly memorable."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"From my couple interactions at Rincon the management staff is dedicated to making certain each event is perfect for the guests. I have only been to one location, however, the amenities are great. There are a few nice lounge areas to chat during events when exausted from standing, there is a dance floor, and bar. Bathroom is cozy and I love the tile. 

The kitchen seems clean and the staff is mindful of the upkeep along with management. The food is tasty!! The menue caters to vegetarian as well."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We visited the Santa Barbara Zoo as our 1st wedding venue in our search.
After one meeting with Angie and a walk around the venue, my (now) husband and I knew we didn't have to look any further!
Angie literally hung out with us and NEVER ""sold"" us on anything, she simply listened, provided answers and got to know us.
She immediately realized we were looking to host a fun and memorable party, that included a ceremony and helped us realize that dream.
It's been nearly 6 months since our wedding day and our friends and family still talk about the amazing food, perfect evening and it being the BEST wedding EVER.
THANK YOU ANGIE! Thank you Events by Rincon, we owe you so much praise for helping us create a vision of our perfect day and for making it all possible!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Being a florist out of Santa Barbara, I have worked with lots of catering companies.  Rincon Beach Club and Catering is class act.  They have a professional and very friendly staff that will make your wedding or event SO smooth!  The Rincon Beach Club in Carpinteria is a gorgeous establishment for an event with indoor and outdoor space.  The food is very tasty and fresh!  They have decades of experience and it shows!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We used Rincon Catering for our wedding dinner. We got married on the beach and decided to hold our dinner on the patio of our rental house. It was a very small affair (about 30 people) and there was a very nice rustic charm to it. Rincon catered our food and it was incredible!! Everyone kept going on about how delicious it was-for good reason! We couldn't be happier with their service and quality!

We had also looked into getting married at Rincon Beach Club and it was a reasonable price for the packages they put together. Mel is super nice and helpful and we probably would have held our wedding there, except we decided to throw the big family get together in a different state where our extended families live. It is definitely worth checking out if you are looking to have an event in the area!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"BEST DAY EVER!!!  We got married at the Santa Barbara Zoo in June of 2019. I grew up going to the zoo and had always thought it would be a fun place to get married. I thought I was going to have my work cut out convincing my now husband to agree. After our initial visit with Angie, we were both sold. He fell in love with the location, the view, the animals, and the possibilities. Angie was so supportive and helpful through the whole process. We planned our wedding from Florida and the communication was great. It was so nice that Rincon Events took care of all the decor and catering. We were allowed to be creative and personalize our event. Guests loved the food! I still get comments from friends and family with how great the tacos, enchiladas, and drinks were. Many of our family and friends came from out of town and fell in love with not only the zoo, but with Santa Barbara. It is beautiful place for family and friends to gather. Our day was perfect!  Angie and her team made our dream a reality."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Fabulous food,drinks,service and beautiful setting! Birthday celebration here was a foodie dream! Can't wait to return to this gem!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Eloise and Rincon were AMAZING!!!  Eloise handled every aspect of my multi-event day and literally was a life saver.  The food and staff were all amazing and things could not have been any more perfect.  Plus, as a bonus, Eloise was fantastic and fun to work with throughout the entire process!!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Sumner and her team did a seamless job.  On-the-ball, knew what they were doing, friendly, thoughtful, and most importantly the food was delicious and the guests were extremely complimentary.  I highly recommend, and I'm picky. :)"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"My husband and I got married at The Rincon Beach Club last year and had the very best experience!  Santa Barbara area beaches are usually crowded and we felt that this beach was more quiet and quaint.  The wedding was absolutely beautiful and barley any beach-goers there in October.  The reception area is like a private outdoor garden and looked so magical at night with all the lights lit up.  The food was incredible and we kept getting compliments for months after about how great the food was and how beautiful the venue was.  I always wanted to have a beach wedding and I seriously could not imagine it any better.  Besides the food and the venue, my wedding coordinator Mel was unbelievable!!  Let me say that again.....Unbelievable!!  She took care of everything and I had nothing to worry about other than just being in the moment.  If there were any mishaps, I never knew about it because she handled it.  She was there from before I arrived till after I left and every detail in between she coordinated so I never was like ""OK what do I do next?"" It was such a relief to know that she was taking care of everything.  She is so personable and fun to work with that I literally felt like my best friend was coordinating the wedding.  We watched our wedding video the other night and all the memories came flooding back as if it were yesterday.  All I could think was how amazing that day was from start to finish and how thankful I was to have gotten married there."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Had my wedding here. On the beach. Carol did an amazing job. Worked with my bridezilla so I didn't have to. The food was incredible. Bacon on a stick, shrimp on skewers were my favorite and not one person left unhappy. Thank you thank you thank you."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Events By Rincon gave us our dream wedding at the Santa Barbara Zoo and we cannot recommend them highly enough for three reasons: 1) outstanding wedding coordinator, 2) convenience and high quality food, and 3) gorgeous and unique location.

1) Our wedding coordinator for the zoo, Angie, is an extremely experienced and gracious professional. She knows exactly what she's doing and made us feel so stress-free throughout the whole process. She has a way of making you feel like you're the only couple in the world because she's caring, responsive, available, and very detail-oriented. We had no idea what we were doing planning the wedding so having Angie as our guide help us plan every last detail was a game-changer. On a personal note, she's an awesome person who is fun to spend time with and get to know, which made the wedding planning process even better. 

2) I cannot recommend the convenience of having an all-inclusive service like Events By Rincon enough. All of their options from decor to food were high quality and it was incredible not having to deal with separate vendors for food, service, tables/chairs, decor, etc. Everything is taken care of. The biggest thing to highlight: THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE. Truly, the best wedding food I've ever tasted. We did the action station options, which was really interactive for guests and gave them options. Every guest commented on how great the food was. 

3) Nothing beats the gorgeous views of the mountains and the ocean at the SB zoo. The animals are awesome, the lush greenery of the zoo is beautiful, and your wedding will be unique and one to remember for the venue alone. 

Thanks to Angie and the whole team at Events by Rincon for giving us our dream wedding!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Rincon Catering is absolutely amazing. From start to finish, the professionalism, efficiency, and dedication that this company brings to each and every event is astounding. My organization has used them for multiple events over the years, and they never cease to amaze. 

Marc, the owner, is so kind and accommodating. Not only does he listen to your specific requests, he gives great ideas and improves on any suggestions you may have. His experience in this field is very evident! You can rest assured that you are in good hands.

In addition to Marc, the servers, cooks, bussers, etc. are all wonderful. They are all so friendly and constantly have smiles on their faces. Their energy definitely brings an upbeat energy to every event that they are at.

Overall, I definitely recommend Rincon Catering for any event that you want people to thoroughly enjoy ;)"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"I wish I had a great review for this place. My experience was not however. After much research, I found this place and it looked perfect for what I was looking for. My maid of honor called and made arrangements with Carol to meet there at 3pm. My fiancé and I drove two hours to arrive there and she was not there. She told her our appointment was at 11 am. I checked with my maid of honor and she said she had written down for 3. So she had the other girl walk us around. She did that but we did not feel invited. It seemed very quick and she handed us cookies as she walked us out the door. My fiancé and I both had the feeling we were imposing. So, we did not have our wedding at this location. It was important for us to not have added stress and to feel welcomed by our planners. It was a beautiful location though."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"From the moment we walked in Rincon Beach Club we were greeted by warmth and hospitality. After visiting numerous venues we accidentally came across Rincon Beach Club through Yelp. Right after dinner we drove there and knew that this was the place for us. We scheduled an appointment and after the first meeting we were in love! Every venue we had visited made us feel like an ""appointment"" but Carol and Marc made us feel like we were at home. It was all the little things...The way they had a box of desserts as a gift for us (and their desserts are BOMB), or the way they dressed up the venue for a mock wedding for us that brought me to tears. This couple is really such an inspiration because they are doing what they love. Every step of the way they strive to make your event so special. It's because of this passion they have helped us make our wedding a reality. 

Guests could not stop talking about how great the food was and so many people told me they had 2-3 plates of food. All our desserts were gone at the end of the night! I love this catering company from the bottom of my heart! They host events at their venue and are also able to cater to the venue of your choice.

Highly recommend them!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Having our wedding at Rincon was the best decision ever! Carol was absolutely AMAZING to work with. She's extremely communicative and her warm personality makes her such a pleasure to be around - especially during your actual wedding day when the day seems like a blur. Carol made the entire process of planning a wedding a breeze - from touring the venue to day-of celebrations. She responded to my emails and questions quickly, managed all the decor and signage, had every detail I mentioned to her stored safely in her file, and worked with all our vendors to ensure the day ran smoothly without us having to intervene at all. We got to get married on the beach with a lovely garden dinner and minimal stress thanks to Carol and her amazing team at Rincon - we highly recommend them!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"This review is for PRE-planning service only.  My fiancé and I had seriously considered having our wedding at the Rincon Beach Club.  We had one of our first romantic getaways in Carpinteria and LOVE the area.  I was in contact with, let's say, Miss A for a few months via email and telephone obtaining quotes and info.  We set up an appointment to meet on a Saturday. She was aware I was driving from 80 miles away. I confirmed via email and telephone.  I arrived at Rincon on said date and time, and alas, no Miss A.  No call. No email.  ""Miss B"" was present, but attending to other wedding hopefuls, so she allowed my friend and I to view the property.  We then went down to check out the beach area.  When we returned about 15 minutes later with a few questions, the building was locked.  A maintenance worker was kind enough to let me friend in, who then spoke briefly to Miss B who was locked away in a back room.  

Thanks for the visit. No follow up ever from Miss A or Miss B. If that's how important PRE-wedding meetings are taken, there is NO way I would plan an entire event here.  Thumbs down."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,negative,"Food was delicious. Only good thing we have to say. Carol said we couldn't hire a personal coordinator because that was her responsibility which she lacked. We asked for the heaters to be out and they were not out , her and her team never put out our macaroons that were to be displayed at each seat as party favors. She said we would have time for photos during cocktail hour then rushed us all out to the street where our photographers had to then improvise, our own photographers said how rude she was it was embarrassing. Then we bought our own number cards for the table with the holders for them to be placed and the workers didn't pack that up so we never received it in the mail. So be honest, as a bride I wish I would have never settled.  It was an extra cost to have coffee be passed with cake so we paid it but the comment was unnecessary, she said something along the lines of good service cost money or something similar I don't recall exactly. And we had a violinist that was playing while I walked down the aisle and he barely started playing before I was rushed to Walk down.  It's our fault because when we first made the appointment she made a comment about if we knew how much they charge . Insinuating she wouldn't waste her time giving us details if we didn't know the ball park price . If I could , I would have never had my wedding here. Luckily my guest didn't notice this because it was all behind the scenes. Do you research before setting . I have 2 stars for great food only not service.oh and she spelled our last name wrong for our hashtag."
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"We had our wedding at Rincon beach club in May and I cannot rave enough about our experience! Carol coordinated our wedding and did an outstanding job. From start to finish, it was a seamless and memorable experience. Carol captured our vision to the max and took care of every detail with ease. The venue looked absolutely gorgeous and the food was absolutely exceptional! All my friends and family cannot stop raving about how incredible the whole experience was! Carol could not have done a better job at making our wedding a stress-free and unforgettable day. So extremely happy with Rincon and everyone who helped make our day a dream come true!"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Being in charge of corporate events boasting hundreds of people would be incredibly daunting if it wasn't for Rincon. From the preliminary planning stages all the way past the conclusion of the event, Rincon is there every step of the way. I am incredibly thankful for Carol, and her fantastic staff who never cease to amaze me. I use Rincon for all my catering needs whether its a simple breakfast for a couple dozen people or our elegant annual dinner for the entire department. Rincon's professionalism cannot be beat and I appreciate everyone at Rincon for making me look incredibly good at my job. Since they handle everything, I'm even able to relax and enjoy the event rather than stressing out and wondering if everything will go as planned.

Prior to the events, Carol is in constant communication with me. No matter how minor my concern may be, she responds immediately. She comes up with a few menus for each event tailored to my specific needs and works with me non stop to create the perfect menu. Her creativity is greatly appreciated as she is always willing and able to accommodate my budget Aside from the menus, Carol shows me in detail all the rentals I will need and my decor options. Carol always know what works best so trust her judgement. The center pieces and table settings at our recent dinner party received rave reviews and it is all thanks to Carol. She called me the day before the event to let me know she had some gorgeous evergreen center pieces she thought I'd like more than orchids. Sure enough, she was right. The smell of evergreen filled the ballroom and was really nice touch. The catering staff is punctual, personable, and professional. I once had a Rincon member turn in a $100 bill he found on the ground, since he knew somebody would miss it when they saw it fell out of their pockets. The money was the tip for the DJ so more than one person was grateful for Rincon's honesty and consideration that night. 

Of course, one of the most important parts of any event is the food. I have yet to try anything that is less than delicious of Rincon's. The  quality of the fresh ingredients they use is evident before you even take a bite. From the fancier events with the three peppercorn tenderloin , to beach BBQ's with chicken and tri tip,  the food has been exactly what we wanted. They bring a ton food too; no one has ever left hungry from any of our events. It is no issue for them to accommodate vegetarians and special dietary requests either! Amazingly, Rincon impresses all of our 200+ guests, and they're not the easiest bunch to please. 

Luckily, Rincon also sticks to their word. There have never been any surprises when the final invoice comes in. I'm particularly appreciative of how Rincon remembers each event from previous years and offers suggestions and insight as to what worked well and what could be improved upon. I don't know how people plan events without such stellar caters like Rincon. I cannot express my gratitude for Carol and all the staff there enough. 

THANK YOU RINCON"
DD3TxygdxBxKh9gbjCuLDA,Events By Rincon,American,positive,"Our wedding last month at the Rincon Beach Club was nothing short of perfection. With a ceremony at sunset, the venue was at first whimsical, and later, under the starlit sky, romantic and warm. Much of this can be attributed to our amazing coordinator, Carol, who kept the whole event running at a smooth pace -- our wedding party, our photographer, the servers and cooks, everyone was always in the right place at the right time. 

The food, the cocktails and wine selections, the decor were all top-notch. We continue to receive complements from our guests! We would absolutely get married here again and not change one thing. Thank you to everyone that we worked with at Rincon, you have an unparalleled passion for weddings/events which comes through in all of the work you do for your clients!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"These people must know what they are doing... after only being open for 2 days the staff was on their game, the atmosphere was magical and the food was the best vegan cuisine I have ever had.  As a vegan I have been dreaming of a place like this coming to the area.  It tastes like they have a true chef designing and executing exciting, healthy meals.  They aren't just another vegan restaurant trying to imitate familiar foods.  This is true fine dining.  We brought friends who are not vegan or vegetarian and they really enjoyed their meals.  The chef even agreed to some special meal requests for our children.   

I can't wait to go back so we can try more of the menu.  I recommend making reservation for a patio table so you can enjoy the beautiful outdoor atmosphere they have created.  There is outdoor heating so no worries about it being too cold."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Highlights: 
     -Great elegant atmosphere, similar to Somerset or BlackBird in Santa Barbara.
     -Variety of dishes and options, good portion size.
     -Nothing heavy with cream/butter so feel great after a large meal.
     -Fantastic mixed drinks (Juice Ranch mixers)

Downside:
     -While the dishes looks great coming out, there was a lack in flavor.
     -Seemed to have a lot of grain/legume/potato dishes instead veggie heavy options.

Favorite dish: 
     -Artichoke ""crabcake"".

The Polenta, Carrot Udon Noodles, and Artichoke Ceviche all left something to be desired in flavors. That being said, my girl friend and I left stuffed with food leftover after ordering 2 appetizers and 2 entrees so the portion sizes are generous.

I look forward to going back to try more of the menu and finding favorite dishes!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Awesome food. Beautiful ambience. Service is awesome. Pad Thai, butternut squash soup, and ushroom tostada was so good."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Excellent food and very accommodating. This is a primarily gluten-free and solely vegan restaurant in Montecito. The service is great and food is delicious. Highly recommended
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My new favorite vegan restaurant in the SB and Montecito area. We are sorely lacking in high quality vegan food that is more than just salads- and now Olivers is helping mend that problem! My partner and I came here and had the avo toast, the potato wedges with AMAZING green garlic sauce, the squash ravioli, the mushroom taco plate, and the chocolate torte. It was all absolutely delish! 

Service was great and the decor/ambience is lovely. Beautiful patio and nice bar. 

We will definitely be back to Olivers! Thanks for making veganism an even easier choice!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"If you are a vegan, go here. Even if you're not a vegan, go here. This is a prime example of what vegan food should be. They nailed everything from the food to the decor.  No detail was missed. Excellent flavors and great service. Sat with a group of four and we all agreed it was a delicious meal worth the price of admission."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Fantastic outdoor dining in Montecito. The patio is amazing, service was great, menu phenomenal."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"OMG, what a great addition to our community!  Physically, this restaurant is just beautiful -- I haven't sat anywhere outside that felt so utterly lovely in, well, ever. There are tables, lounges, open flow to the bar . . . and you sit among tree branches and delicate glowing lights.  Just stunning.
   With so much outdoor seating, they were also dog friendly. My dog's presence made the experience feel like a real social occasion, as various other diners (including young children) came by to say hi.  
  The wait staff and host were very friendly and attentive, so that was also a big thumbs up.
   And finally, the food.  We ordered a lot of variety, and we got a lot of food-- no skimpy portions here.  Everything was delicious, although the Pad Thai, as a GF option, was a bit chewy.  I'd probably skip that if I went back.  But again, how amazing to be a vegan at a restaurant and able to order pretty much anything off the menu and have it be delicious and well presented as well.
  Oh, and they carry a lot of local (SB County) wine, which is always a plus in my world.
  Lucky day to live close to this new restaurant!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"As a non-vegan I knew it would not be my new favorite place but I was eager to give it a try as I always enjoy trying new places and I try to eat pretty healthy. 

I can't say I was disappointed but i also was not blown away.  
It was also pretty expensive. Which granted is expected in montecito.  But to serve chick pea ""crab cakes"" at a comparable to reall crab cakes is a little absurd. 
Everything was tasty though. 
I did order the crab cakes and I really like them! 
I had the lush bowl and tuna salad as well. 
The only thing I would not order again would be the potatoes with truffle.   Very very bland. Even after adding lots of salt they were not very flavorful. 
Great service! Our waitress was very delightful!  And the guy who was setting the tables around us was very friendly as well. 
The cocktails were good.  They are basically pressed juicery juices with alcohol. A little expensive for being so simple. The bartender was nice but not super talkative.- which I thought was a requirement for all bartenders to interact with the customers well.  
I would go back with my vegan roommate but probably won't take my sister when she comes to visit."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Loved it. The food is incredible. The pear and gorgonzola​ flatbread was so delicious as an appetizer​ that my father ordered a second one for his main and refused to try anything else. The artichoke crab cakes were also a favorite, but everything we ordered was delicious​. Whether your diet is solely plant-based or not you will enjoy your meal here.

Not only is the food good, the service is impeccable​ and the atmosphere​ lovely. We cannot wait to return. It is worth every penny."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"UPDATED:

On third visit to Olivers they had gotten their act together. Truly a nice experience from start to finish. I've upgraded from my previous 2 star rating to 4 stars. I think they have the potential to be a 5 star... they're just a little new to be there yet. I'm a fan of Olivers and look forward to many more Impossible Burgers in their beautiful restaurant.

Previous Review:  Second visit to Oliver's this month and specifically to indulge in their Impossible Burger again. The burger did not fail to disappoint! Best vegan burger I've ever eaten and I've tried MANY. What did knock them down to two stars is the service/attitude and the bland yet over-salted side salad and side dish we ordered.

First, the service/attitude: So it's a Friday night at 5:10 and we live up the street from Oliver's - literally two minutes away - our plans had changed and we decided to grab a quick bite somewhere while heading to the SBHS football game. My wife called ahead and asked if they could take the two of us if we came right down. The reply was that we could sit at the bar but there were no tables available... So we show up -- fully prepared to sit at the bar. I tell the guy that greets us that we just called. He looks down at the reservation sheet and doesn't see any notes and says ""Oh, you must have talked to Phil. Would you like to sit inside or out?"" Literally 75% of the tables were empty - it is exactly 5:15 at that point - so we take a very nice table inside and all is good except that I feel like I just got yanked around by a tudey 20 something at my neighborhood restaurant. 

So we eat. The burger is great. The Brussels sprouts are just okay (they could take a lesson from The Lark) and the side salad is literally lettuce with no dressing and chunky salt on top. Anyway, the burger and martini are still killing it when the server brings the check ""When you're ready... no rush..."" I literally am still wiping off burger juice from my lips when this happens and this happened on our first visit as well with an entirely different server so this must be in their training - to quickly turn tables. This is Montecito people NOT LA. There are not enough people around to turn tables multiple times a night. We purposely spent an extra ten minutes tending to what was left of our tepid waters (what's with the no ice???) while our server checked three times if we'd put our credit card out. We finally stopped the madness at 40 minutes in or about six o'clock. The tables had filled up a bit but about a third were still empty.

Drop the 'tude Oliver's. You don't want to scare the locals away...

I'll be back for that burger but will be asking for it TO GO next time."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,I was excited to try Oliver's as their are not many vegan restaurants in the area. The service was stellar and the food delicious and fresh. My wine selection of Sauvignon Blanc was bright and crisp. Not a single disappointment with our experience.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The host there was amazing, brought blankets to our table when we were sitting outside by the heater. Beautiful chill ambiance with DELICIOUS food. Want to come here every day."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We waited more than four years for this restaurant to open after Peabody's closed. As a local and an aspiring vegan, I am delighted Oliver's opened on Coast Village Road. Beautiful setting and decor. The dishes are hit or miss. Some have more flavor or substance than others. I've eaten here 3 times. I would eat here every week if not so pricey. I hope they start having lunch service soon."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,This was the most amazing dining experience in many years. Ever dish was infused with delightful flavors and textures without anything overpowering. I highly recommend the butternut squash soup and risotto. The Pad Thai is beyond delicious.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is the best Vegan restaurant I have been to. It has been years in the making but it's plant based AlIVE and oh so good. The ambiance is simple and stunning at the same time. The bar is a great hang out place for a large group of friends or you can hang outside and dine under the stars. I have to say this will be my new normal. Great job Oliver's , I'll be back over and over and over again. Shhhhhhhh my favorite was the Artichoke Crab Cakes which I didn't get a photo of because it was gone before I took a photo. Sometimes you just can't help yourself."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Excellent food with a relaxed, upscale atmosphere. Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread pizza rocked as did the Lotus bowl. Nice wine list, and great service. The chocolate cake and ice cream were delicious and we couldn't resist the Apple Crumble!! Worth the cost for sure; looking forward to returning soon."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Oliver's was everything we would expect as far as ambiance and level of cuisine.  The outside terrace is very comfortable and well arranged.  There are many outdoor heaters so everyone in the evening can stay warm and a beautiful lighting arrangement in the trees offers just the right mood lighting at night.   

Our experience with the food was overall very good.  We were a group four people and two of us are vegetarians and two carnivores.  We all four throughly enjoyed the food.  We ordered 3 phases of several items and all shared.  Standouts were kung pao broccolini, artichoke crab cakes, zucchini flatbread and the chocolate fudge tart for dessert.  

I give Oliver's only 3 stars because it misses entirely the fundamental mark of offering good service.  I say this especially for it's Montecito location and the level of local clientele it presumes to please with trendy dining at a upscale price-point. 

From the very start it was apparent that 90% of the personnel were young and had limited experience.  
We ordered sparkling water to start and two cocktails.  The water itself took 5 minutes to get to the table after ten minutes of already having been seated and awaiting a server to present themselves.   The two cocktails slowly followed and from here set the rhythm for an ongoing disappointment and frustration for every aspect of our service and I'd presume the same for those around us.  

On the arrival of our salads we had to ask for cracked pepper / this seems to me elementary for even Olive Garden to offer cracked pepper for your salads upon placing them in front of you.  Some silverware and eventually a small plate were dropped to the floor by servers in our peripheral. Every table was full with customers and a train of young severs were continually meandering through the tables in a disjointed fashion that showed minimal teamwork and little awareness.  
Dishes for our courses came out slowly, at times too slowly and at times our sever was away too long.  At a point we had to hunt down our server (by asking the young lady that was bussing some of our plates to find him) so we could order a bottle of wine.  Our server had totally disappeared for literally 15 minutes into our second phase of food arriving.  I'd like to point out that our two cocktail glasses stayed on the table throughout the entire meal (with ice totally melted) and were never taken away - odd when we had thee exchanges of our small tasting plates exchanged throughout the meal.  Further comical was that every time, (3 times we needed to request at least one new fork that were taken with the cleaning of cleared dishes previously).     The server had such limited experience with opening wine bottles he had to excuse himself from the table and have one of his colleagues return to open our bottle and present it to us for the tasting.  She was successful in opening the bottle, however her lack of experience was apparent when she asked me to taste the wine and poured less than a teaspoon in my glass.  I asked her politely to give me just a small bit more to get a taste - something to actually run out of the glass in it's trail into my mouth.  
The last comical moment was at dessert when we were given 4 servings spoons for our cobbler.  One of these to dish out servings would have been sufficient.  But, apparently we were to actually eat with these too.  I'd say they weren't practical for fitting into our mouths and were totally useless for eating any of the chocolate fudge tart that needed a fork for sure.  We at this point took it all in stride and were laughing.  

Bottom line - service here was very disappointing.
Food was excellent 
Atmosphere very comfortable 

I hope as this place gets it's rhythm together soon and it becomes a 5 star by correctly addressing it's major service shortcomings."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is hands down our favorite place to eat! Oliver's offers drinks, starters, entrées and desserts all plant-based using ingredients I would use at home but with a creative twist summing up an ultimate party in my mouth. The kids love it too, tipping the review to a full 5! Oliver's has perfected fine-dining for vegan couples and families. Can't wait to share our experience with our friends! BTW, the service is impeccable, as is the establishment. (And be sure to check out the extra touch in the gorgeous rr - Jo Malone hand soap! Love it!)
My favorites: cocktails, zucchini flatbread, mushroom tostada, pad thai, & chocolate tort. Servings are large and delicious!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"It's like... high end vegan heaven. (And I love meat.)

Check it out!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's was truly outstanding. No doubt the highest end vegan/vegetarian restaurant we have dined at. The ambiance is excellent. Dining inside or around the patio area which was not only gorgeous but comfortable. Everyone we came in to contact with from the staff was outstanding and friendly and provided excellent customer service. I was able to watch reception the entire evening based on where we were seated, and they sincerely enjoyed their jobs and happily greeting people, both in and out. Management was always close by ensuring at least the front end of the house ran smoothly. However, the food was the true showcase of the evening. It was hard to limit ourselves to just one item on the menu. My entree of grilled cauliflower ""steak"" fell a little flat, but they gave the best possible shot cauliflower has. I should have gone with the butternut squash ravioli as recommended by our server. Absolutely everything from the appetizer to salad to entree to desert was probably the best vegan and or vegetarian food we've ever had. Will definitely return, looking forward to it. I only hope they can maintain their freshman enthusiasm and keep the standards high over time."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This place is stunning! What a welcome addition to Coast Village Road. 

First, you leave your car with the valet and enter on a wide, open patio. The multi-level tree house of the past is completely erased. The cutlery and polished wine glasses on every table gleam in the sunlight. It's absolutely gorgeous. This is a great place for a date, a drink with friends or a comfortable solo meal at the bar. 

The drinks include cold pressed juices that make it feel like you are nourishing your body rather than drinking alcohol. The names are fun movie references and I loved that The Big Lebowski was playing on the bar TV. 

Although I love actual crab, their ""crab"" cakes were delightful with sweet corn and aioli to round out the effect. The pad Thai was smoky and full of tasty veggies. I really can't wait to come back here and tell my friends how much I love this vegan restaurant!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I visited Oliver's on a weekend getaway with my husband. We've been eating mostly vegan for about a year and a half and generally want to eat healthily which is hard to do in nicer restaurants (or any restaurant). We eat at home a lot because of this. As a vegan cook myself, I really appreciate it when a chef makes food this amazing for me!

Oliver's was perfect! It has a really good vibe, not too formal, not too casual, just what you would imagine for a relaxed but still really nice place. The outdoor seating was really comfortable on the summer night we visited. 

We split the jackfruit tacos appetizer. I always order jackfruit if it is on the menu because you don't see it too often and I never cook it at home. I liked the tacos. My husband found them to be a little spicy for his taste. I would order them again as a entree. It was a very generous serving for an appetizer, which was a pleasant surprise. 

We each got an entree, which normally we might split an entree after a substantial appetizer but I really wanted to try as many dishes as I could while I was there. The entree portions were also larger
than I expected. I was too full to try my husbands dish and I bought some of mine home. I had a curry dish that I thoroughly enjoyed.  

The desserts sounded amazing but like I said I was full! I want to go back just for the dessert!

I wish we had a place like Oliver's where we live! Hope to return someday!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone whether they are vegan or just open minded."

iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,I made reservations for Valentines dinner because we had never been there and wanted to try.   Well after work on the 14th I checked the menu and oh looks like its all vegan.   Well we were very plesantly surprised with the offerings.   Service was 5 stars.   Plates were great.   Will be doing this one many times over.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,My husband and I had an amazing dinner here.  The roasted sweet potatoes and truffle potatoes were heavenly.  Artichoke crabcakes.

Don't hesitate to go here if you're thinking about it.  :)  Enjoy!!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My mom (she is vegan) and I had a wonderful experience here. The menu is vegan but it's also delicious food regardless. We had the flatbread, fingerling potatoes and artichoke crab cakes. It was plenty of flavorful food.

The dessert was a chocolate tart - delicious and rich. My mom wanted it because chocolate is so rare for her. The rose wine was also wonderful. We sat on the patio and got to enjoy our beautiful santa Barbara weather. The service was excellent - attentive and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in SB. It's pricey but it is worth it for a nice dinner out."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My new favorite restaurant! The drinks and food are superb even if you're not vegan but if you're vegan it's like finally finding water in a desert as there are very few good vegan options in Santa Barbara. The atmosphere is beautiful both inside and on the patio. Our party just ordered a bunch of the smaller plates and shared them. I especially enjoyed the Brussels sprouts and the artichoke ""crab"" cakes. The soup was excellent as well. We need more restaurants like this in Santa Barbara."

iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My husband and I went to Oliver's for our anniversary dinner, and what a wonderful and memorable experience we had! We are both vegetarian and try to eat vegan when we can, but I would recommend this all-vegan fine dining restaurant to anyone and everyone for a special occasion. He had the farro risotto, and I had the polenta. Both were fresh, hearty, flavorful, and beautiful. (Anyone with a taste for capers and tomatoes, the polenta is the way to go! And anyone who likes sweet corn will fall in love with the risotto.) We were then happily surprised when the server brought us a complimentary anniversary dessert - the maple apple crumble with homemade coconut vegan ice cream. It was to die for. Not to mention the ambiance of Oliver's - the indoor/outdoor arrangement is cozy and magical. The garden-like patio sits beneath strings of warm twinkle lights.  Candles glow on every table and space heaters are scattered throughout to help take off even the slightest Santa Barbara chill. This will most certainly be our new spot for any celebration worth a splurge. (Or for a drink and to split an appetizer! GREAT appetizer list.)"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Wow! I'm speechless but yet I'll find enough adjectives and wonderful words to use to describe Oliver's. What a brilliant dinner out on the patio. The staff are lovely. The patio is warm and cozy, yet elegant. The curried chick peas danced on my palate, the anise was detectable but not overpowering. The Pad Thai was inspirational, I can't wait to get home and try and recreate for my vegan and non vegan family members alike. Also, the cocktail menu is wonderfully robust, even if you only have the time to stop by for a drink, you will not be disappointed by the unique and flavourful creations they have here. It's rarer than it should be to find an upscale, fine dining vegan restaurant, but finally, Oliver's fits the bill. Despite us living 3+ hours away, I look forward to returning, hopefully for our anniversary this summer. Keep up the exquisite work!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I don't eat meat- this place has so many great options. It definitely helps those who aren't familiar with vegan cuisine try something new. Anna is a fantastic server!! Patient, and with wonderful suggestions based on what I had asked. Tried the impossible burger special.... oooooh man!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The good:

-- The venue is beautiful. Just about perfect on that account. 
-- Service was friendly and attentive.
-- Some of the food was surprisingly good for this non-vegetarian -- in particular, the vegetarian ""crab"" cakes that everyone talks about and the flatbread. 
-- I came away surprisingly full.

The okay:

-- We got a couple of the specialty cocktails. While they weren't bad, I thought the tastes were a little off. They seemed more complicated than they needed to be. 
-- The avocado toast was just that -- avocado toast. Nothing too special.

The bad:

-- The prices are a little over the top, especially for vegetables. But this is Santa Barbara, so okay."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This restaurant is wonderful .  We ordered the flatbread, pear and beet salad and the crab cakes.

The bar is so inviting. There are sofas and fireplaces and lovely outdoor lighting.  I will be returning in the next few nights.  The general manager, Brett, is charming.  Parking was easy and they offer valet if you prefer that. Delicious. Delicious. Delicious.  It is such a wonderful addition to the restaurant scene here.

iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"First time we visited here and ordered food and we were very disappointed because we ordered Rawzania which is consist of raw 2 tomatoes, 2 raw Zucchinis and ricotta sauce filling & was very small in portion & cost was $23. And it which was the expensive item on our menu and to us it was rip off item on the menu. 
The server came by asked us how's everything after we got food on the table and we said everything good except the Rawzania because our kids were expecting as it was normal pasta lasagna with pasta sauce , the server said that's what we serve and said sorry and that was the end of the conversation and never suggested anything else at that time. And at the end, we suggested to server that the item should be explained more better in details and again she said sorry and said we make this item as a presentable item to customers but maybe don't care about the taste the way she sounded. We hope to had substitution for that item but the server never suggested but when we were gonna pay asked for our bill that's when she said next time tell us in the beginning so we can change it for something else but we did tell her in the beginning that everything was good but we didn't like the Rawzania. 
So it was poor service by the server and as we walked out we told the manager to explain item more in details on the menu as we suggested it should say uncooked and raw vegetables basically that make what it was. And he too said sorry and that was  it.  We were hoping they have taken this item of the bill bu we paid in full and left disappointed. Also there was dessert called apple crumble with scoop of ice cream and that item did not taste good at all had way too much cinnamon and it was not good presentable item and was not worth the price either. 

Most restaurants will accommodate you once customer states don't like their food item or problem such as in our situation or they would accommodate to provide good customer service even the manager didn't care sounded like as we left.  So it was very poor service by the server she didn't explain well before we ordered as it was first time there. And some how as this item Rawzania, was expensive item and we wonder  why this item was not on the internet showing photo of this item as other famous food items we noticed. 
So don't order this Deseret not worth for $10 and don't order Rawzania unless you like raw zucchini and raw tomatoes and ricotta cheese. 

We wonder and felt our appearance made them prejudice towards us perhaps that  made them serve us in this manner."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I've been vegetarian for 37 years and have had the opportunity to try veggie restaurants all over the US, Canada, Europe, and Israel. My favorite for the last two decades has been Millinium formerly in San Francisco, now in Oakland. Our fist meal at Olivers blew us away. We had three small plates all of which were wonderful, but the artichoke ""crab cakes"" were out of this world!  The summer risotto and keep noodle pad Thai were amazing!!!  The service was top notch and they did a really nice job transforming the old dinner into something classy without being pretentious. It's amazing to have this just a three block walk from our home. We will be regulars!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"A M A Z I N G !!!  Food, atmosphere, staff, location-- all hit the highest possible bar. We enjoyed it so much we ate there two nights in a row while we were in town. This restaurant should be at the top of your list if you want a fresh, satisfying and interesting vegan meal!!! Thank you for having us Oliver's, we love you and can't wait to come back!!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"A terrific restaurant with deftly prepared vegetarian cuisine, attractive setting, good bar and easy going professional staff. What more could anyone want?"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Casual dining in a relaxed atmosphere wonderful for Friday night drinks and hors d'oeuvres very relaxing lovely service healthy food I would definitely return
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This place has the atmosphere of a true VIP lounge. Excellent selection of music -- jazz & chill downtempo type of style. Food is seriously incredible -- I had the potatoes with Thai chilis appetizer, lotus bowl entree, and Kung Pao broccoli & cashews side dish. Topa Topa IPA on tap -- the best. Most importantly the service was A+++. I will definitely be back soon!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Unfortunately Oliver's did not pass the mark for me. Treated myself for my birthday dinner here. Ambience & service is awesome! Wine was very very good!! They treated me with a dessert for my birthday. Oliver's get high mark for all of these.

But food was very average - honestly- bland almost. With such a huge price tag - Oliver's can do better. I'm a food critic myself & their chefs need to up their games in terms of flavor.

Sorry, don't agree with the rest of the reviewer 
:( Sorry Oliver's :("
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Top 3 favorite vegan restaurants..between here and Los Angeles. Not a huge menu but enough verity for everyone. Food is so flavorful, colorful, and your gut will tell you healthy.
Original plates. Had the crab cakes, padthai, some salads and one of the best soups ever.
I don't review much but impressed by this place and the nice vibe here.
Stopped by twice once on the way north, and on the way home."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"The food was extremely expensive. One appetizer and two entrees and 2 glasses of wine came to $102 for VEGETABLES and that did not include the tip. The appetizer was tasty but the ravioli were not as good as any Italian restaurant I have been to. The cauliflower ""steak "" was nothing more than over steamed cauliflower."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"First of all we showed up with no reservation. It is Mother's Day.  Who knew vegan was so popular.  They made us wait at the bar, one seat and the other standing until a couple left. Told us all tables were reserved but as we waited, we watched  the empty tables stay free.  The food was amazing but as we laughed and enjoyed our night, part of our laughter was at how none of the tables were filled. That is why you get 4 stars NOT 5. We can't wait to come back!!! No reservation really needed. Hahaha"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,My husband had the pleasure to dine here for our anniversary. The food was incredible and the service was impeccable. We had a wonderful experience and are so glad we celebrated here. We can't wait to visit Santa Barbara again and go back to Oliver's.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The food was great! We got the pear flat bread, tacos and the impossible burger and they all were pretty good! The place is a bit pricy but it was totally worth it! Service was slow as it was not even busy when we were there but the waitress was very nice and helpful."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"It's a really good restaurant!
The atmosphere in the restaurant is so nice. 
I like the idea with no meat on the menu!
It was a positive experience!
Thank you.."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Who said vegan had to be boring.  So nice to have a vegan/vegetarian upscale restaurant option.  Food is creative but more importantly, delicious.  We had the zucchini lasagna.  It was crisp and refreshing with great flavor imparted by the pesto.  The lotus bowl was also delicious but a lot of food.  All the flavors worked well together.  We ended the evening sharing the chocolate fudge torte.  Chocolate decadence.  Can't wait to come back and explore the menu."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Great restaurant. We went with a staunch vegan friend 2x and enjoyed the entire experience. It reminded me of a place in Tuscany that my husband and dined at while honeymooning in Italy. As for the food, simply amazing. Since it was the 3 of us, we wanted to try a little bit of everything. So we started with crab cakes, moved onto risotto, impossible burger, truffle potatoes, hummus platter and 2 bottles of California wine. Our waitress and the sommelier were very helpful and knowledgable making our night even better. I'll definitely go again."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Great food but drinks outrages
Ice tea $5 no refills and a regular martini
$16 !!
2 ice teas $10 is too much"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Great service something different vegan food let see how that goes but so far everything is in point amazing services and great music if you in Santa Barbara stop by
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is the best Vegan restaurant I have been to. It has been years in the making but it's plant based AlIVE and oh so good. The ambiance is simple and stunning at the same time. The bar is a great hang out place for a large group of friends or you can hang outside and dine under the stars. I have to say this will be my new normal. Great job Oliver's , I'll be back over and over and over again."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Currently on a road trip from SF to LA. My girlfriend and I both have dairy allergies, so we were ecstatic to see a cute vegan restaurant on the way. We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess and welcomed by great atmosphere. Their outdoor seating is great even in the winter with the plentiful heaters surrounding each table. The waiters were friendly and helpful. 

My only complaint is the expensive price for such mediocre food. It's the kind of bland food you'd expect from any typical vegan restaurant, but double the price. The food is aesthetically pleasing, but overall disappointing. 

The ""apple pie"" is a scoop of coconut ice cream over granola and apples. Don't even waste your money on it. Tastes no different than your average bowl of oatmeal in the morning."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,I was so pleased when Oliver's came to montecito. Santa Barbara was long overdue for a plant-based restaurant that's both chic and delicious. This is by far my favorite spot go bring friends- plant based or not. Try the jacksfruit tacos and apple crumble.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Very clean, elegant and Bohemian style. They have been open for 6 weeks and packed every night!! Between the food and atmosphere a 10!! Classy and I can't wait to come back. We were in a hurry and sat at the community table and ordered quite a few bites. Vegan hamburger (delicious beet and mushroom patty), artichoke cakes, potatoes, avocado toast starter and butternut ravioli!! Super clean, elegant, fresh and we wish there were more Oliver's around!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"All sizzle ... and no steak. 

A lovely setting.  Comfortable patio seating.  And the interior is well appointed and tastefully lighted.  Very appealing. 

The Artichoke ""Crabcakes"" were, as advertised, quite good.  Delicious, reasonably imaginative and a decent sized portion.  Now if only the rest of the orders matched that level.  Alas, that was not to be ...

The toasted Farro Risotto was okay, but not at all interesting.  The same could be said for the Cauliflower Bucatini.  While ""bland"" may be too strong in describing both dishes ...  not terribly inspired with the seasonings ... would definitely apply. 

The Wild Mushroom Tostada wasn't bad, however at $22 a plate, the amount of actual wild mushrooms in the dish was disappointingly small.

Didn't bother with the desserts.  And the modest wine list is quite pricey. 

Service was fine however the food was rather slow in coming out.  No, actually it was quite slow.  Not good.

Sooo ... perhaps a salad and the ""crabcakes"" would make for an enjoyable and satisfying repast.  Beyond that ... well, it is a nice looking and comfortable joint."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Its so awesome that entrepreneurs are investing their time money and passion into veganism. Its essential to sustain our planet. I applaud Olivers and their delicious, diverse menu. Thank you!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I am not vegan, but a friend recently converted for health reasons. On a short trip up the coast to SB, we decided to check this place out. The food is good, but more surprisingly, the portions were pretty huge. We ordered two appetizers, two entrees, and one side for three adults and it was so much food we took plenty home."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Excellent food options with a lovely dinning ambience. The servers were on point and knew menus items well.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This place is incredible. Service, ambiance, food were all top-notch. Will definitely return."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Many think that you have to compromise when it comes to vegan food, but that is NOT the case at Olivers! The food is amazing and certainly does not lack in flavor. The food here is certainly worth going to check out regardless of whether your a meat or plant eater! Not to mention the atmosphere at the restaurant invites you to stay for hours, enjoying your time among friends, coworkers, etc. This restaurant is simply beautiful from the modern yet rustic and comfortable feel."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This restaurant is wonderful .  We ordered the flatbread, pear and beet salad and the crab cakes.  Each dish was beautifully presented and full of fresh, delicious ingredients. The staff is delightful. Also worth raving about is the atmosphere and setting.  The venue is beautiful.  The bar is so inviting. There are sofas and fireplaces and lovely outdoor lighting.  I will be returning in the next few nights.  The general manager, Brett, is charming.  Parking was easy and they offer valet if you prefer that. Delicious. Delicious. Delicious.  It is such a wonderful addition to the restaurant scene here. And you don't have to be a vegetarian to appreciate the meals."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Such a great addition to the Santa Barbara restaurant scene! I'm vegetarian and my husband eats meat...and we both loved it. After sending back the hummus that was under seasoned, they happily gave us the flatbread instead, which was delicious. Mains were the risotto and pad Thai, which I was greedily eating off my husband's plate! We even ordered dessert (a rarity) of apple crisp. It was so delightful. The staff was very friendly and helpful and ambiance lovely. Will definitely add this to the regular rotation!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"So excited that SB has a plant based restaurant! Everything was amazing. The service, ambiance, apps, drinks, and entree's were so good! I have no complaints other than that I wish they were open for lunch on the weekends. Maybe by summertime they will be. Can't wait to visit again. Even meat eaters will be pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything is."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's is a wonderful restaurant, with delicious food. My meal was fabulous, and decorated beautifully. Sitting inside, volume was also average, enough to hear each other without yelling. :)

Although kind, our sever seemed to be overwhelmed. Service was very slow. She seemed to forgot numerous dishes, for us and others.  Additionally, after one of our dishes came with an extra piece, one of the servers made it a point to carry the plate back to the kitchen, and bring the dish back as it should have been served. That was after he had already put down the plate!

I enjoyed a great meal at Oliver's, however, the service seems to need some adjustments."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Ohhh my god. Please do yourself a favor and enjoy this establishment. I can't begin to explain how happy my husband and I were with this dining experience. Everything is decently high priced but worth every penny. The cocktails are made with actual juice from the shop across the way. We ordered too much food but had to try a lot of the menu items. I highly recommend the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread. I can't wait to go back and try other items! We sat outside with the beautiful sunset behind us. The staff is nice and helpful! Mariah was the best waitress and a super genuinely sweet human. We enjoyed our night thoroughly and can't wait to go back! Did I say that already? I mean it!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,One of the best Restaurant I have enjoyed. Pure Santa Barbara Montecito vibe. Large lovely patio and a cool hip bar. Service was laid back and at the same time attentive. If your a foodie and in SB you must not miss it. Fabulous chief unique menu! It may be all vegan but I guarantee you the non vegans in your crew will love it

iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,Small portions for the price. Nice atmosphere but slightly arrogant service. Wouldn't go back.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"I loved Peabody's just a block from my house.  Tammi did a great job bringing the quality up to a delicious level.  It closed and a couple years later we have Oliver's.   

I posted the menu, refreshingly healthy and vegan.  I was kind of excited.   Ordered a Caesar Salad and a glass of the Cab, Cab was delicious but the salad was so salty I couldn't eat it.    They were nice and let me pick again.   Beet Avocado Salad with Citrus.    Still extremely salty but better than the Caesar.  

I need to give this place another chance, perhaps the wild mushroom tostada will curl my toes or the Pad Thai will blow me away... I hope so.   

So far anticipation has exceeded reality while I have been anxiously been waiting for this restaurant to open forever my initial introduction has been a disappointment.

Ok, as I wrote this the manager approached me and said a couple wanted to sit st the bar, asked if I could move over a seat.... no problem.  I got comped my glass of wine!!  This place is looking up."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's is the go to spot for fine vegan dining! It's a beautiful restaurant. My husband and I were camping in Big Sur, stood in Carpenteria on our last night and found this restaurant on HappyCow. We showered and changed really quick, we headed to Oliver's which was an 11 minute drive from Carpinteria. When we got there we went straight to the bar where they had the most amazing, healthy and wonderful cocktails. The food was to die for. Philip, Bret and Ana were extremely hospitable and recommended some amazing places to check out in Santa Barbara and Carpenteria. This place definitely has our business whenever we come down to this area."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Such an amazing dining experience! One of us is vegan and one is not so why not try a place that is solely vegan for the evening? We were visiting the Santa Barbara area and found this gem on yelp. The service was superb and the food was absolutely delicious. I wish we didn't live 3 hours away so we could frequent the location more often!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My goodness, I did not anticipate it would be so fancy! Cloth napkins, white tablecloths, shiny silverware  Food was A+. Had the crab cakes, risotto, and my friend had pad Thai that he said was pretty spicy! Cute outdoor seating area! Will definitely return to try some other dishes and cocktails!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"My wife and I have gone to Olivers more than 15 times. And we really liked it in the beginning. But there seems to be a lack of creativity. Presentation is great, ambience is nice. There's a new burger on the menu that we're excited to try out, and the Shishido peppers are always great. I'm rooting for these guys and hope they can break out of the box a little more because they're doing everything right except playing it a little too safe!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Plant based  restaurant. Banh mi was outstanding . Perfect balance of crunchy baguette, spicy jalapeños, basil, cilantro, tofu was well marinated and deliciously seasoned. 
Papaya slaw with beautiful red cabbage and special sauce that rounded out the perfect banh mi sandwich. 
Extra fresh salads, tomato soup was rich and decadent, and Oliver's burger was super fancy, dressed up to the nines with smoky coconut bacon, aged cheddar cheese, sweet poblano, on a soft pretzel bun. The Thai fizz drink ( you can get it non-alcoholic like we did) was delicious with the crushed Thai basil and ruby red grapefruit . Everything was absolutely delicious. Even my MIL who asked us if there was any meat at the restaurant was impressed with how delicious all the dishes were. My FIL, an avid cheese lover , didn't feel like he was missing out on with all the plant based cheeses. Sooo gooood! A must visit. #plantbased #glutenfreeoptions"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,If I could give this establishment 10 stars I would.   From the greeting at the door until you leave the service is not just excellent customer service.  It is an exceptional customer experience.  The food is great and the portions are large.   The wait staff actually care about the customers experience.  Even if you are not a vegan Olivers is restaurant must.  The atmosphere is fabulous.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Beautiful setting! We sat out on the patio. Craft cocktails with a healthy twist. Drinks are a bit pricey but they are good and strong! We tried the impossible burger for the first time, so tasty! My husband and I don't really care for Vegan cheese though, so far. Joe, my hubby likes to eat AVO toast out even though it's a regular meal at home. This place is upscale but it's not snobby. Great service as well. Love Love Love that more Vegan restaurants are opening!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"This place is simply just not worth the trip. Don't get me wrong it was OK. Wine selection was good, and I was pleased with the ambience. I called in to make a reservation the day of, and they had asked if it was a birthday or anniversary. It was my girlfriends birthday so I kindly responded yes. We ordered a glass of wine each, decent pour and good wine. We ordered the wild mushroom taco where the main event was guacamole, tasty but lacked more ""Wild"" mushrooms. We also ordered the pad Thai which was just ""meh"". Nothing to say mmmmmmmm to. Then they asked if we would like desert, we responded yes, in hopes that the fore mentioned birthday would constitute a candle (like the table next to us with a birthday got) OR  complimentary dessert. We got neither. What's the point of asking on the phone then? Idk. Dessert was good, but again.... nothing to call home about. So overall everything was ""meh"". Shoutout to our server though, he was nice. It was way overpriced for mediocre food. Will not return and kind of upset they didn't even mention the birthday. Just another ""montecito"" spot with no real flavorful food but a good ambience."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This place is amazing! The ambiance, the service and the food were all outstanding. I came here with my mother for a mother/daughter date and we'll be back for lunch tomorrow :)"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"There was nothing done wrong at this amazing restaurant!  From the food to the service to the decor.........everything has been done right!  Where do you find such fresh, local amazing food with such a warm, professional attentive staff??  I am not a vegan but i love Oliver's Menu, food, service and the beautiful environment!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Was pretty apprehensive about a vegan restaurant but this place is the real deal. Even my ""meataterian"" husband enjoyed his food. We will be back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Went to Oliver's under protest! I am not a vegetarian nor vegan. Big mistake. I should have known better. Simply amazing. I left my order to our waiter. I allowed him to pick his favorites and to not concern himself with how I might like or not. At this point it did not matter. I threw my hands in the air, like I just don't care. I advised him that I am a carnivore. Sounds worse then it is. Our waiter made three choices. HEARTS OF PALM CEVICHE, BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP, VEGGIE BURGER and TRUFFLE POTATOES. 
In addition I ate off of her plate and finished them all off. Everything was amazing. I was not disappointed. I did not leave hungry. Excellent choice in the bar section, great champagnes. I will definitely come again. If I had to change one thing(it is summer) and or add something. I would suggest a cold gazpacho soup or a cold vichyssoise."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Okay RUN not walk to Montecito and go try Oliver's!!! My husband and I are always looking for something healthy, but we also wanted someplace a little more upscale for dinner (not always an easy combo). Oliver's is right off Coast Village Road but the restaurant and patio are elevated, so you completely forget that you are on a busy street. It is very modern and chic, yet a charming ambiance. There are lights throughout the trees hanging above the patio which gives it such a cheery feel. Classic Sinatra-type music playing. The bar is super sleek and fully stocked with organic spirits. Most of the drinks on the menu are basically health drinks and local juices (from Juice Ranch) mixed with alcohol, they are amazing! The food comes in very generous portions. LOVED the artichoke crab cakes (my fav), the tostada (its huge) and the lotus bowl with tahini. Chamomile tea and apple strudel dessert with granola was the perfect ending. The staff is great. I will obviously be telling everyone about this place! Can't wait to visit again!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,One of the best cocktails I've had in a long time and the food is amazing. Service was A+. Team here is so friendly and accommodating.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Wow is all I can say. From the decor, service, ambiance and cuisine it was perfection. I'm a total meat lover- ribs are my fav- this place was completely satisfying as far as flavor, texture and filling go. We did not have room for dessert. It took us a long time to try because my husband was worried he'd still be Hungry after.... not the case. We recommend the crab cakes, tacos, burger and the seasonal salad of heirloom tomatoes and avocado. Yum!!

Every seat in the house was beautiful and the cocktails were fresh and fantastic. The service was friendly and prompt. 

I was truly blown away with this place. A MUST GO!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"This place purports to be a vegan small plates restaurant, but we've traveled around the country and tried lots of vegan small plates places and this was disappointing. 

Service: we were seated right away, but nearly 15 minutes went by before a waiter came. He didn't explain the menu in any way, or make any drinks recommendations. Flying blind, we chose the Gold Rush and our waiter disappeared. 20 minutes later, he reappeared with our drink. We asked him how many small plates he'd recommend per person and he said one. We were utterly puzzled. He didn't seem to understand the menu or the concept of small plates. Still, we ordered 6 dishes, one of which never made it to the table. After he took our order we never saw our waiter again until dessert. All the dishes came out at once; nothing was staggered or paired carefully. The place has a pretty pretentious vibe. And many servers were milling around casually, so it seemed odd that they were so inattentive to our table. 

Food: we ordered Korean bbq glazed carrots, truffle potatoes, Brussels sprouts, artichoke ""crab"" cakes, sweet potatoes, hearts of palm cevice, and the apple crumble. It was a pretty wide swath of food. There was nothing outstanding. There didn't seem to be a cohesion to the menu or even to individual dishes. There were almost no plant-based protein sources on the menu, which left us both a bit baffled and underfed. Hands down the worst taste of the night was the Gold Rush drink, which tasted like actual dirt. 

I guess the restaurant gets a lot of local love. But from a couple of vegan foodies: give this one a pass."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Love it!
I love vegan food. Healthy and does not harm animals. Cooked with a consciousness of care and appreciation."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,I would give Oliver's 4.5 stars if that was an option. Amazing outdoor set up. The apple salad and the chopped salad were our two favorite items. We also really liked the japanese yams.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"A very good meal, an amazing vegetarian experience. I love fish and game and I didn't miss either. Chopped salad was yummy and the butternut squash ravioli and risotto were stellar, but the long beans added the bite needed to cut the richness. Great bar and wine selection makes this a truly unique restaurant."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"What a gorgeous restaurant. Modern yet warm Montecito-chic with the place brimming with beautiful people. Oliver's will likely become a favorite local hangout since the bar doors fold back to a charming patio filled with tree lights and comfy furniture making it a great place to mingle and meet. I've dined there twice now and if you are a vegan, I would imagine this is nirvana. The cauliflower 'steak' with lentils has great flavors, as does the mushroom tostado and sweet potato appetizer. Less appealing was the bland farro 'risotto' with squash and tomatoes but no noticeable herbs, garlic, wine, lemon (or worthy butter/cheese substitute). The veg burger was rubbery although the side salad was good. The cocktails are inventive and tasty, wine selection good, and on tap a Topa Topa IPA --my favorite local beer. So with excellent service and ambience, what's missing? Me and my fellow dining companions agreed we would love it (and become regulars) if they added a few fish or chicken side options for us omnivores.  A girl can hope."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's is absolutely terrific! It is by far my favorite restaurant in the Sant Barbara/Montecito area, and my go to recommendation in my profession as a Concierge at the Ritz-Carlton Bacara. It will always be my top choice to bring friends and family to for a guaranteed wonderful dining experience! The patio seating with my English Bulldog right before sunset is close to a perfect evening, and I would definitely recommend going here for a special occasion or for a lovely date night! You will not regret it."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"This was originally 3 stars but as I started writing this I realized I was getting angry. 
I've never had a meal collapse so thoroughly in a restaurant I actually paid to sit down in. Some of it wasn't their fault. But some problems here are, now that I read the reviews, endemic.  We had reservations but when we arrived we were told there would be a considerable wait because it was raining.  Turns out that about 1/2 of their space is outside with no protection. I don't really understand how that works on a nightly basis (was the night of our reservation the only time it had ever rained in Santa Barbara?) but okay, we waited for an inside table. The beseiged Maitre d' comped us a round of drinks (good on them, and the drinks were great).  When we were seated, we ordered the artichoke ""crab"" cake, which was excellent, and the white asparagus soup, which was weird -- sweet and tasting like anything but asparagus. Turns out it's sweet potato and quite a few other things with some asparagus -- this wasn't mentioned on the menu.  A weird thing was that at no point were we brought sharing plates, so we had to keep passing stuff back and forth. Which would have been fun on another night. Not this one.
Still, so far everything was fine.  We'd ordered a couple more things and so we waited.  And waited.  When I looked at my watch, it was 8:45 -- we'd been there 1 hour 45 minutes -- and our entrees were nowhere in sight. Our server was scarce. No one was there to check in on us. People who were seated long after us were getting their meals first. And no, not because we'd ordered something complicated. 
Finally our shishito peppers arrived. They were lukewarm and soaked in lemon brine, and they didn't at all go with the dipping sauce. The Impossible Burger was terrrible. I've never had a terrible one before. I didn't know you could screw one of those things up.  It was lukewarm and the green pepper had been, what?, fried or something to the point of sliminess. The cashew cheese was tasteless and cold. You know how it goes when you come to a point where something tiny that makes no difference is actually the last straw? The bun was so firm that biting into it forced the entire burger out onto the table -- not a plate, because they hadn't given me a sharing plate.  Wow, it really was an impossible burger. Petty, I know, but that's when we gave up. 
When we got there, I felt sorry for the folks working there trying to make the best of a rainy night. But by the time we left I felt worse for myself, my girlfriend, and the rest of the diners trying to make do with the inadequacies of this restaurant."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"I think there's a bit of grade inflation in the reviews for vegan restaurants.  Vegans want them to be good, they want to reward restaurateurs who offer plant-based food, and they don't want to criticize the one fancy vegan restaurant in town.  I'm not going to play that game.  Our Thursday night visit to Oliver's was quite disappointing on all dimensions.

We arrived for an 8 pm Thursday reservation, which was apparently too late for Santa Barbara.  No one was at the host stand to greet us, and several waiters walked by while we were waiting. 

I ordered a virgin juice cocktail, but they delivered me one containing gin. The waitress caught the error after a few minutes and was very apologetic.  I didn't send it back (I'm not an alcoholic and wasn't going to let a perfectly good drink go to waste), but she still billed me full alcohol price for the drink, and the virgin one she delivered later. That's a tacky way to make $7. Don't put me in the position of being the jerk customer throwing out good drinks, just comp me with a correct drink when you make a mistake like that. 

The food was pretty average, generally underseasoned and severely undersalted. We used up almost the entire bowl of Himalayan salt that was placed on the table.  Perhaps they undersalt their food because of all the hypertensive old folks living in the Santa Barbara area?

None of the dishes had the ""wow"" factor of dishes I've had at well-known--and frankly much, much better--vegan fine dining restaurants in LA (Silver Lake), Oakland, and Philadelphia. 

Artichoke ""crab cakes"": undersalted and underseasoned 

Mushroom tostada: seemed like they left it under a hot lamp too long, the tostada was not tostada, but soggy. 

Margherita flatbread: just fine, nothing to write home about. I've had a better vegan pizza at a cheap pizzeria in a dodgy neighborhood in Riverside, CA. 

Truffle potatoes: acceptably tasty, but not all that original. Is this 2005?

Apple salad: best item that we had, but no wow factor 3.5/5 

They gave us the bum's rush at the early hour of 8:55 pm, asking us to order dessert before the kitchen closed.  Busboys were shutting down the restaurant around us as we were finishing our under-sweet granola-like apple crumble dessert.  The stingy portion of vegan ice cream topped off an underwhelming dessert and an underwhelming evening."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Mushroom tostada, Apple salad very good. Jackfruit taco hearty and great spicy green salsa. Margherita flat bread tasted like boboli with fake cheese... not good. Pretzel burger can't remember name maybe amazing burger great flavor. Hummus just okay but side of naan crispy and warm. Service good. Squash soup bland and overly creamy. Big party so we tried half the menu."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"OMG! My tastebuds were dancing the Charleston the entire meal! We did small plates to sample more variety. Wow! Clean, fresh and complex flavors. 
We had a flatbread, crab cakes ( vegan) kung pao cauliflower, a zucchini, cashew cheese, heirloom tomato form of a Caprice salad. Amazing dessert. The chef is a genius! 
Can't wait to eat there again. 
It is a little bit pricey, but is a vegan treat that anyone can enjoy!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Had dinner here last night with my wife, thank you Yelpers for helping us find Oliver's. What a wonderful, elegant restaurant for dates, special events, or even just to stop by for one of their creative, strong and flavorful cocktails. I highly recommend the Apollo. Oliver's is what we need more of: fine, high quality, vegan dining with staff and chefs who take pride in what they offer and prepare. Can't wait to visit again next time we're in Santa Barbara, in fact, having the opportunity to dine at Oliver's is reason enough to plan a trip."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Absolutely stunning experience. The ambiance, the food, wine, service all top notch. Adored our evening out here. My meat loving husband loved all of the food too! Fantastic spot with a beautiful outdoor terrace."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Great vegan food, but too expensive for vegetables. Interesting menu items,  the wild mushroom tostada is very good, but $19 for a tostada is a bit ridiculous . Small restaurant so make a reservation and don't expect a lot of privacy when dining. Dressy casual attire, nice for a special occasion.  I think the food is very good vegan food, but it's a splurge spot in Montecito."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Don't try this place unless you like to wait. They know how to honor a reservation like the rental car company in the Seinfeld episode. When we arrived they said ""We will have your table in 15-20 minutes. Have a drink in the bar."" There was no room at the bar. We left and do not plan to return."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"As a lifelong vegetarian I've eaten at many veggie restaurants in many different parts of the world. Oliver's ranks among the worst. First the good. The large patio was a very pleasant place to dine. We were seated promptly and the good ends there. It took over an hour to have our dinners served with no explanation from our perky server. The Pad Thai was so salty that it was inedible  while the mushroom tostada was bland. Interesting. When we told the manager of our experience he replied that next time we came he would ""do something for us"". I replied that there will not be a next time. At the prices charged there are many better places to dine where your business will be better appreciated."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Love this place! The artichoke crab cakes our my fav. Great cocktails. Wonderful and atmosphere
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Had a great meal last night on the patio! It was a very chilly night, but all the heaters kept us warm to eat outside! 

There was fOur of us and we all decided to split a bunch of food:
Truffle potato's, ""crab"" cakes, Oliver's salad, pear & ""gorgonzola"" flatbread, cauliflower, pad Thai, and two desserts.

All of the food was awesome. I left overly stuffed by not feeling like garbage because itS all  vegan! Delish. Wish we lived closer, but nextt time we visit we will be back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Finally made it to Oliver's and everything I ate was incredible!! I am not vegetarian or vegan and I'd tell everyone to come check this place out!!

We had Artichoke ""Crab Cakes"", Zucchini Flatbread, Truffle Potatoes, Chopped Salad, and both desserts they were offering that night. I think the Artichoke Crab Cakes is one of my favorite dishes I've ever had! It is served with corn and arugula, two of my favorite ingredients in any dish, and the flavors were amazing! The Zucchini flatbread was also great, cashew creme on it was a great substitution for cheese and the bbq sauce wasn't overwhelming. The desserts were a flourless dark chocolate cake, just as good as it sounds, and this apple crumble thing with coconut ice cream. We practically licked the plates clean!

Even though the food was amazing I was a little disappointed with our service. When our waitress came to the table she didn't tell us her name or say anything about the restaurant/menu, which I found quite odd considering it's sort of a niche restaurant. 

Regardless, everyone, vegan or not, should try Oliver's!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Delicious food, beautiful patio, great staff.  Loved dining here!  I brought my family (who eats meat) to Oliver's which is plant based and everyone loved it and couldn't stop eating.  So good. Can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Montecito."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I have nothing bad to say about this place! Came here last night with some friends and what a great experience I had! We started off with I think the best two appetizers!  (the pear/Gorgonzola flatbread & the artichoke crabcakes) Because we like to try everything, we each got an entree to share everything. The pad Thai, impossible burger, and the Farro, woooowww! The Cauliflower bucatini wasn't my favorite but still ate it! Enjoyed a nice bottle of wine with it and finished off with a peach crumble & chocolate tart! Such a relaxing dinner under the night sky (they have heaters on the patio) with such great company! Will be coming here again and again!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Love this place, food is so tasty. Seriously the best Hummus We have ever had and the ""bread"" is way better then normal bread. Great atmosphere and decor. Friendly staff that makes you feel welcomed. Its a nice place to unwind with friends or even that someone special. We left feeling very relaxed."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Fresh.  Tasty.  Inventive.  Beautiful setting.  A wonderful vegan restaurant.  Thanks!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Excellent service, beautiful space! Crab cakes, Margherita Flatbread we're the better two over the chopped salad and  Brussels. The Green Hornet is  healthiest mixed drink that you won't feel guilty about. We will definitely be back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We had a wonderful experience at Oliver's for our first time last night. Anna was a friendly and attentive server. We were offered menu suggestions and appreciated that. The specialty cocktails can be made without alcohol-we had the Johnny.....( something or other) shared the""crab"" cakes and shishito peppers-YUM! I chose the risotto-very filling and my spouse had the Pad Thai and loved it. Clean and comfortable-sit outside! Can't wait to go back. Thanks Oliver's for making our 4th anniversary special."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I think this was one of the best meals (not just Vegan) we have had at a restaurant in a long long time! The food is beautiful, the atmosphere is great, the decor is chic, the drinks are delicious, and everything was perfect! Flatbread was delicious, the pasta was fresh and flavorful, the plates were photo worthy, and we will definitely be going back! What a great find. This would be a great date spot, vegan or not! Also a great place to meet friends. Loved the outdoor atmosphere, could not say better things about this place. A++++"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is our ""go-to"" restaurant for any special occasion. The food is absolutely amazing along with the ambiance. We have tried quite a few different dishes and have never been disappointed. One of our favorites is the Kung Pao Cauliflower share plate. It is beyond delicious and pairs well with the Pad Thai. Treat yourself to a wonderful night out and sit outside on the patio with a glass of wine and have an incredible meal."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The restaurant is upscale and valet parking is complimentary. We went to celebrate a birthday. Most of our party were meat eaters, and we were impressed with the 100% plant based menu. We shared plates and everything was delicious. I especially liked the crab cake and the apple salad. We also tried a risotto that was  a special, off-menu item. It was all very good and I would definitely come back. Do not be afraid to try this place!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My wife and I came here for dinner and had a great meal and excellent service.  Tyler was such a great waiter!!  We ordered the tacos, toastada, veggie burger and pad thai.  All were flavorful and unbelievably delicious.  We also got an excellent bottle of Pinot Noir (JCR) recommended by Tyler which was a great addition to our meal.

I would highly recommend this restaurant if in the area, close to the area or passing through.  Our meal was one of the best.  The restaurant itself is setup well and nicely decorated that makes you want to hang out for a long time while enjoying a nice glass of wine or cocktail."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Can't say enough about this place! I'm not a vegan but I can tell you right now if I eat here every day I wouldn't be missing anything! The food the ambience the service, all excellent! Came here for my extended birthday celebration  this year with some great friends! We absolutely all loved it! The hummus plate was amazing, the artichoke crab plate was fantastic, the artichoke crab cakes were solid, the Thai curry delish, Zucchini tower of deliciousness, and we ordered two of the wild mushroom tostadas. Would have ordered 3 but we were pretty stuffed by that point. The drink menu was excellent and I wish I could remember what it was I ordered, but you pretty much can't go wrong with any of the drinks there!
Hang in there Olivers we can't wait to come back once this lockdown is over!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Definitely some of the best vegan food i've ever had. The artichoke ""crab"" cakes were to die for (better than most regular crab cakes i've tried), the lotus bowl and mushroom tostada were also incredible. The staff is friendly and the ambiance is wonderful.

For desert we had the apple crumble & a few cocktails (made with organic, raw juice from Juice Ranch)."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Service was excellent.  Food was incredible - Kung  pao cauliflower, Italian sausage flatbread, apple cobbler dessert.  Who knew Vegan food could be so delicious.  We will definitely be back."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Very underwhelming and not that creative. Most dishes were bland and boring, clearly developed by a nonvegan who doesn't seem to know what vegans eat. We ordered four things. One was inedible and permeated with a flavor of rancid oil. We sent that back. One was decent but the hair made it unappetizing. (Both were taken off our bill). The other two were average. 

I guess I'm very spoiled living in Los Angeles where we have about every kind of cuisine represented but this place is a disappointment. I like Matthew Kenney, his heart is in the right place, and 20+ restaurants is an empire, but this one needs a major revamp. I understand vegan options may be hard to find in the area but this isn't a great representation of how good vegan food can be."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Vegan restaurant in Montecito. Parking in the street. Nice atmosphere, friendly service. I ordered the ""crab"" cakes. They were pretty good, small around the size of a scallop. I loved the spicy aioli sauce, that was the best part for me! 
Pros
Clean food
Extra flavor 
Interesting menu
Cons
Small operations
Charge for plain soda water ($4)
Pricey
Only a few gluten free options"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Such a dream come true. I was looking forward to our dinner here during a short getaway and it did not disappoint!!
-such a dreamy patio, with hanging lights, view of the open bar, and well spaced out tables. So so romantic 
-service was good, good suggestions and genuine service, thumbs up 
-food: loved. Expensive? Def. but worth it for high quality fine dining ish vegan food!!
-truffle potatoes: if you love potatoes it was good. I wish it came with an aioli or a dipping sauce, but it was lightly seasoned, came piping hot
-Cobb salad: was a special for the night and I loved it!! Crispy lettuce, creamy sauce, maybe coconut bacon, crispy tofu, avo, and cashew spirulina blue cheese?! I don't like real blue cheese but vegan blue cheese was so flavorful and light and amazing 
-artichoke crab cakes: the cakes themselves could've been crispier, but with the corn and arugula, a delicious bite 
-lentil bolognese: soooo good. Tagliatelle was perfectly cooked. Meaty and toothsome and perfect. My carnivore husband rly enjoyed 
-pad Thai: just sounded so interesting I had to get. Def a big portion, wish it had a little more actual noodles bc you get a ton of veggies with this like bean sprouts, bell pepper etc. but it came with cashews and a touch of something creamy, so it was def unique with a delicious sauce. I wouldn't say it was exactly pad Thai, but overall I liked it a lot
-drinks. Spot on. Pretty steep for drinks. $17! But they were lovely
-key lime pie: beautiful presentation, I think cashew based which is good but the nuttiness of the cream base was a tad strong, but still enjoyable 
-overall what a lovely space with amazing vegan food that was well thought. Def the highlight of our trip!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,One of the best meals I've ever had. And I'm a .  Don't be afraid of the cold zucchini and tomato lasagna.  I had it on the outdoor patio on 11/24/18 and it was delicious. Of course it was unseasonably warm. It's a great warm-weather entree.  And the chocolate torte is the best dessert. I had it with a second glass of red wine but you could have coffee just as well.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is by far the best restaurant I've been to. Being a vegan I am so grateful for this restaurant. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday tonight and everything was absolutely perfect. They paid attention to every detail and the service was amazing. The ambience was cozy and romantic and very inviting. We started off with the truffle potatoes with the green garlic sauce and spicy miso aioli. Then he got the Apple salad and I had the chopped salad both were fantastic. For Entrees he had the pad Thai and I had the impossible burger which was by far the best impossible burger I've ever had. We finished off with the chocolate tart and warm strawberry crumble, which they hand piped ""happy birthday"" beautifully on the plate. I would and will recommend this place to everyone and will definitely be back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I HIGHLY recommend this place. The first time I came was for lunch and I enjoyed it so much I came back for dinner, THE SAME DAY! The food is excellent. The staff is extremely nice and professional. The restaurant has a great vibe and beautiful interior. For lunch I ordered a salad and for dinner I had the jackfruit tacos! Everything is plant based. Thank you, thank you. For once there is an upscale vegan restaurant! I will most definitely be coming back next time I'm in town! For non vegans- this place is worth trying! You won't even taste a difference and you'll be glad you went! It's good for your health and the planet! Plus you'll have an excellent time at this restaurant."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Food here is amazing and the staff is super friendly with a great environment. Love coming to Oliver's
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,The Ambiance is amazing here. Full vegan menu! Not pricey. Many options. Not vegan fast-food
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Great food! Manager is a sweetheart 
Mushroom tostada was unbelievable and don't forget to get a vegan espresso martini!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,The flavor from the menu were absolutely amazing. We ended up not ordering a large plate. We stuck to 5 small plates and shared. Perfect for a couple.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Great food, medium service, super strong, pricey and unique cocktails, and a perfect setting. Can't believe the renovation of the old Peabody's. Dishes were original and very tasty, quite filling, and the entire restaurant had a warm quality to it. I forgot my sweater and the staff called me that evening and held it until the next day. That's a level of care that you can't put a star on. We'll be back, it's pricey but worth it."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The food was to die for and the wine was amazing! The service was less than mediocre, however. We had the risotto and the pear flatbread both of which were phenomenal. It's a little pricey but that's to be expected being it's all vegan and we're in Southern California. I just wish our waiter had been a bit more enthusiastic and refilled our waters without asking. All in all Oliver's is a very good vegan restaurant. I would go back."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Delicious menu in a beautiful patio under large trees with appealing finishes.  Great drinks and good service too.  We ordered multiple items and it was delicious with layers of flavors.  The plates were large and fulfilling and I can't wait to return.  Oliver's is a real gem!!!!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is without a doubt the best vegetarian meal I have ever had! And I love some pork belly or steak. The flatbread and asparagus truffle soup were my favorites. Wine list is really solid as well. 

Patio and the restaurant in general are amazing as well! They have some patio string lights, heat lamps and outdoor fire."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"INCREDIBLE. AMAZING. Wasn't sure about the vegan experience but hey, after visiting Oliver's I might consider becoming vegan! Beautiful outdoor space, amazing food, great friendly service in the beautiful Montecito. Do yourself a favor and experience Oliver's."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Celebrated Valentines Day a couple days late with my bf, and couldn't have asked for a better evening! The pear Gorgonzola flatbread and artichoke heart crab cakes are a must. We were sat on the patio on a 55 degree night. Normally, I would have asked to be moved inside, but their heat lamps were incredibly accommodating. I even took my coat off! Mariah was a wonderful server, and the management brought us a dessert to make up for our late celebration."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My bf and I had reservations here for a Saturday evening to celebrate our one year anniversary.  

There was valet parking and ample street parking.

We arrived 15 minutes early and waited at the bar while our table on the patio was being prepared. Our table was ready within 5 minutes... complete with a flower arrangement that my bf has ordered from Montecito Flowers and coordinated with Oliver's to have ready for our arrival.  The patio was beautiful, comfortable, and relaxing with music playing from speakers, string lighting and heaters.  They also had blankets available to keep you warm. 

The menu included a wide variety of vegan options that all looked delicious and creative.  We opted for Crab Cakes, Brussel Sprouts, Truffle Potatoes, Wild Mushroom Tostada, and Impossible Burger.  For desert, we had the Blueberry CrumbleEverything came out in a timely manner and was delicious!  The Crab Cakes were lite and tasty.  The tostada was also lite and flavorful esp see nice I love mushrooms.  The burger was huge. My bf who is not a vegetarian said it tasted like a real burger.  

Service was exceptional!  Everyone was professional, courteous, attentive, and personable.

The two restrooms were unisex, single user restrooms.   They were clean and spacious. 

Prices were reasonable.

We loved Oliver's.  We will definitely be back to try more menu items.  

Solid 5 for a vegan restaurant!

Another great visit to Oliver's!  This time brought people with us.  Party of 5.  The weather was a bit chilly but under the heat lamps, we were toasty.

This time we had the same appetizers as before (crab cakes and Brussel Sprouts) but added the Spinach and Artichoke Flatbread and the Farro Bolognese.  For our entrees we had the Veggie Burgers, the Impossible Burger, and the Toasted Farro Rissoto.
Risotto.  Sides included salads and truffle fries.  For dessert, we had the Boysenberry Crumble.  

The food was amazing.  The favorites were the Toasted Farro Rissoto (flavorful and lite, not over sauced), the flatbread, crab cakes, and Brussel Sprouts.  The Veggie Burger was my least favorite but still tasty.  I found it a tad sloppy to eat and a little mushy... not a first date food. 

Service was outstanding as usual.  Our server was Angelina B.  Angelina was also our server the first time we visited.   She remembered us.  :)

Still 5 stars!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Absolutely amazing vegan restaurant! A must go to in Santa Barbara. This is one of the best meals I have had. This is an upscale all vegan restaurant. I went with my mom and we shared a few dishes. We shared the kung pao cauliflower, garlic hummus and summer squash flatbread. Everything was absolutely delicious. The kung pao cauliflower was perfectly cooked with the most delicious sauce with just the right amount of spice. The hummus had hints of garlic but was not too garlicky as to overwhelm the other flavors. It was served with a beautiful assortment of veggies and delicious caramelized onions. The flatbread was absolutely amazing. A perfect combination of squash, zucchini, delicious almond ricotta with some gold raisins and pine nuts and the most delicious pesto sauce. What I really loved about these dishes is they really highlighted the vegetables and were truly plant based. Also a the dishes were beautiful plated and very instagrammable if that is your thing. For dessert we had a maple apple crumble desert with coconut ice cream. I enjoyed it but thought it was weaker than the savory dishes. It still had nice flavor and the ice cream was great. Overall I was absolutely blown away by this meal and will definitely come back if I find myself on Santa Barbara again. Also should mention staff were great and restaurant felt very safe. Seats were very spread out and there is a large outdoor seating area if you'd feel safer outside."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Such a great experience! Their online reservation system worked well and the entire staff was very professional. We had the day's special salad which was fresh from the downtown Santa Barbara farmer's market. It had seasonal fruits and quinoa and was so delicious. The summer squash flatbread was very tasty and quite filling, definitely enough to share. The wild mushroom tostada was good, the guac was definitely the main flavor I got. Not a ""small plate"" at all. The lentils in the beluga bowl were a touch salty but everything worked well together and the presentation was beautiful. For dessert we had the maple apple crumble and the chocolate tart. I would recommend the tart. It was super rich, not too sweet and had a wonderful crust at the bottom. Phillip and Lyle were both very pleasant and accommodating."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Jamie was lovely and the jackfruit taco was fantastic. Thank you for the perfect solo dinner, Oliver's!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,5/5 would recommend. Love the outdoor patio atmosphere. Kind and caring service. Wonderful food.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,We tried the pad Thai and arugula flat bed topped off with glass of red wine. Dessert was the apple crumb with ice cream. Yummy. We were going to sit inside but it was crowded and loud. We ended up on the patio which was quiet and beautiful. Heaters kept us warm. Our waitress was a delight.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Went here for dinner. It's a great place. They served really fresh veggies with really nice service. The interior has soft color and they have really cute picture on the wall. They make food not boring. They would put berries in the salad so the salad has little bit sour taste with berry and maybe it not greasy. Will definitely come back here!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Best vegan food I have ever had! Came here during the summer and sat in the patio and it was wonderful! I would recommend this place to anyone staying in Santa Barbara or Montecito! Beautiful restaurant with amazing appetizers, meals, and desserts!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is my new favorite restaurant! The service was amazing and they really made my birthday amazing!!

Although can be a little pricey, it is the perfect place to go for a nice dinner!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Always outstanding everything on the meal is amazing last night was the mushroom ravioli. Service for pick up was outstanding billy at the bar with the phone order and Phillip at pick up.
We will be back"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The food at Oliver's is exceptional! Even my carnivore friends love not only the food, but the vibe, too. We usually order a bunch of different plates and all share which is fun. The setting is so cool, yet unpretentious, and the staff are friendly, too.
My only recommendation is that they get organic soy candles in the bathrooms rather than the commercial polluting ones they had last time we were there.
Pro tip: try to sit on the deck at sunset"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"I have been looking forward to trying this place for years now. 3 biggest issues: 

1. Was sat at a large round table set for 6...such a no go, not sure what the hostess (who I think was the manager, blonde guy) was thinking. It was extremely awkward as my guests and I could not carry on a conversation unless we shimmied around in our seats. Our server did remedy this about half way into our meal as I asked if we could be moved to a table for 3, not 6. 
2. Food was trash. Like actual trash. And so ridiculously over priced. WE ALL LEFT HUNGRY BUT DIDN'T WANT TO ORDER ANYTHING ELSE because we lost all hope...
BREAKDOWN: 
-brussels sprouts: overly drenched in oil, like, all I tasted was oil 
-artichoke ""crab"" cakes: ZERO flavor, aioli was beyond spicy so I couldn't even add that to try to make it into something edible
-jackfruit taco: should be priced at $1.50, just nothing special, tasteless, small, avoid 
-butternut squash soup: tasted like cinnamon broth & was a luke warm
-tomato confit: again, oil. Too much oil. The pistachios were burnt and hard as rocks, you'll chip your tooth on those bad boys 
-Italian sausage & peppadew: SO DRY
-key lime pie: it was the best thing I had there, but like, not impressed at all DAIYA's key lime pie is better...
-chocolate tart: so rich, crust tasted like pebbled cardboard, so rich but also sort of tasteless?
3. Montecito pricing without meeting Montecito expectations. I am curious to see how long this place lasts. 

SUGGESTION FOR OLIVER'S: fix the food issues, it's honestly not good. I've been vegan 15 years and I LOVE plant based restaurants but I will 10/10 not recommend this one. 

SUGGESTION FOR WHOEVER IS READING THIS: try the following: Fatty Vegan in Ventura (AMAZING), Mesa Verde right up the hill, Mony's for bomb vegan tacos, Sage in Agoura Hills if your looking to spend more money, or Natural Cafe if you just want a good ol quick and easy plant based lunch."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I hate giving this only 4 stars, cause the place is magical, so cozy and so beautiful. The stuff is super nice as well. But food!! I was wanting to come to this place for so long, so we drove there for my bday from LA and even though the atmosphere was amazing, the food was a disappointment. They eliminated a lot of items from their menu so it's pretty small one. All we ordered was like meh.. absolutely nothing crazy or something I would remember, all was pretty plane. If you wanna get some wine and enjoy your evening thats the right place!!! But definitely not for dining."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,We loved this restaurant.  Delicious food and great ambiance.  The Vegetarian and Vegan dishes are delicious.  Also very good and friendly service.  Highly recommend this restaurant
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"WOW! Let me start with my only complaint. Service was slightly lacking but we went on a holiday in the middle of the pandemic and it wasn't horrendous, plus all of the staff was so nice, so I'm pretty sure this is not the normal experience. 
The food is AMAZING even if you are a meat eater. We got the crab cakes, truffle potatoes, jackfruit taco, and Kung Pao Cauliflower. Everything we ordered was a hit and a must try. I think we found one of our new favorite spots on the greater SB area."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Idk what fabulous detail to mention first, so in no particular order: thoughtful, delicious food, outstanding attentive service, nice variety of small plates, salads, flat breads and mains on the menu, gf and raw options, extensive wine and craft cocktail list, intimate yet lively ambiance, spacious patio (though we dined in the main dining room, the patio was pretty packed!). We ordered WAY too much food, but here goes: Kung Pao Cauliflower, Artichoke ""Crab"" Cakes, Heirloom Tomato Tower, Pear & Gorgonzola Flatbread, + dessert, which was generously on the house for our anniversary. In short, the food was immensely flavorful, the staff were well trained, the restaurant is clearly well organized/managed, and the ambiance was inviting. Oliver's has definitely earned a place in your hearts, and we will be back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is a beautiful restaurant, with amazing staff, phenomenal food and complimentary valet parking. My husband and I dined here tonight for our  anniversary. We had the crab cakes, impossible burger, Brussels sprouts and Shasito peppers. Each dish was beautiful and super yummy. Our waiter was sweet and gave recommendations for our day tomorrow for places to eat. The heaters were perfect on the patio even though it's really cold (40 degrees) perfect night. Thank you."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's was amazing. The deck is beautiful and the food is amazing. I could not believe it was vegan. We had great service and our waiter was spot on with suggestions. We decided to share everything so we could try different plates. We ordered the truffle asparagus soup, pear and Gorgonzola flatbread, cauliflower bucatini, and artichoke ""crab"" cakes. They also gave me a chocolate torte for my birthday for dessert. Can't wait to go back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Wonderful views. Amazing service. Incredible food! Super easy to get to. Not too far from butterfly beach. I wish I would have known about this restaurant sooner. Everything is vegan on the menu. This dinner was fabulous. I still have dreams about this meal!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Great restaurant! High quality food and beautiful surroundings. I wish we had more restaurants like this one in Santa Barbara
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I honestly don't even know where to start with this place. I am 100% plant-based so this restaurant is my HEAVEN. The ambiance is incredible. The wait staff was so sweet and even communicative with my hard to please two year old. We got the kung pao cauliflower and the curry which were both sooo yummy. I ordered the drink ""Billy Billy"" and even that was so yummy! The hospitality here was amazing and I cannot wait to be back. I recommend coming at sunset since all seating during COVID-19 is outdoor now."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This has been my go to recently. The Oliver's Burger has been my week night favorite meal. Everything smells soooo good when I walk in to pick up my order. Really want to try more of the menu items when they are open again - been hesitant to order small plates to go but have tried the artichoke crab cakes , which are epic!
Cocktails here are super good. The cosmic raspberry is awesome!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Loved the ambiance.  Stunning setting, feels like you are on vacation. Margaritas are excellent.  I would suggest the cauliflower and peppers.  Didn't love the Brussels or ravioli."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The only word that can describe this place and our experience is WOW! My best friend and I came to Oliver's on a Tuesday without a reservation (which we didn't expect it being so packed on a Tuesday night!). We were offered the option to wait for a place at the bar to open up and we decided to do so. This was the best decision we made!

From the food to the service - this place is absolutely amazing. I completely understand why this place was packed on a Tuesday night. Billy and Tom assisted us at the bar and we would come back just for these two ALONE! Their service and kindness were unlike anything we have experienced dining out. They were so attentive and paid such attention to detail making sure we felt right at home being LA Natives. And Billy's drinks are exceptional! You can truly tell that Billy puts his heart in these drinks and loves his craft. Both Billy and Tom made our experience here at Oliver's unforgettable and we are so glad that we decided to stay and wait for a spot at the bar. 

Now on to the food - not only does it come out fast and HOT, it is phenomenal! The star of the show was definitely the Kung Pao cauliflower! We saw a couple share this dish and also had it recommended to us and it does not disappoint! Words cannot describe how delicious it is - but if you do visit, you will not regret getting! The mushroom ravioli was also very delicious and they did an amazing job with the combinations of textures and flavors to make an exceptional dish.

We look forward to coming back to this place the next time we are in Santa Barbara and will opt to sit in the bar area just so we can have amazing company with Billy and Tom! Thank you both for such an amazing time, you guys made this trip so memorable!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's is everything a vegan/vegetarian restaurant should be!

Great upscale, modern, and romantic ambiance; friendly staff; and delicious, gourmet contemporary fare. We came right before closing but were still treated well and were not rushed out the door.

We ordered a variety of plates to share, and my favorites were the Spinach and Artichoke flatbread and the Key Lime Pie. 

Would highly recommend to plant-based diners, and I have a feeling any omnivores in the party would also be satisfied by Oliver's offerings. 

We'll definitely be back next time we're in the area!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I'm not a vegan but my wife is so I decided to surprise her with a restaurant where she didn't have to pick through the menu to find something she could eat.  The restaurant is really nice, the outdoor dining area is perfect.  The food was awesome, flavors were great and the presentation was on point.  Definitely will be back."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Came here with my mom and my pup for a girl's weekend night out. Mom had the lentil bowl which tasted AMAZING and I had the fall flatbread which was equally amazing. She got a cosmo and I got the Billy Billy with regular blanco tequila instead of mezcal, just a personal preference. I didn't taste hers but my drink was so yummy, I had to have two! We also had the Brussels sprouts which were probably the best part of the meal! You've got to try this place! Service was attentive and polite. We were able to sit on the patio with heaters since we had Bonnie. Overall AWESOME experience!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Amazing flavors! We ate the artichoke crab cakes, jackfruit tacos,  mediterranean salad, and potato fingerlings. Everything was delicious and full of amazing flavors! We will be back."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Excellent food, service and ambiance. The three main things you need from a restaurant. I'm not vegan, but this restaurant changed my whole concept. I'm returning!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Loved the menu and the patio! Prices are what you'd expect, but the flavors are unique and the patio is beautiful"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Great location, great vegan food and wonderful service.  Small but tasty menu.  The Bahn Mi and ""Tuna"" melt were amazing.  It's hard to do vegan food this well, so we got talked in to the Apple Crumble.  Also excellent.  Even for folks who are not vegan, I would highly recommend this spot right in the heart of Montecito near the 4 Seasons."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan, but by far they had some of the most delicious foods ever!. Extremely wonderful friendly service with a beautiful outdoor seating area which was a great complement to the wine list and the fantastic food they served. I highly recommend a visit even if you are not a fan of vegetarian or vegan foods or if you just have had enough of overpriced steak houses."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I went Oliver's with my friends. We really liked the ambiance, I know it took them 5 years to remodel the building but totally worth it :) 
We ordered several dishes and shared them, the portions are small but the food is quite testy. Overall it was a nice experience I would go back again"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,This was such a nice experience! It's hard to find an upscale vegan restaurant anywhere so I was very pleased to find this gem on vacation. I enjoyed the Brussel sprouts and crab cakes along with a refreshing cosmo. The food was great and I wished I had room to try more. The customer service was outstanding from the host to the bar! I would suggest this for an upscale yet laid back experience. I highly recommend this if in town and looking for something new!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I was blown away by the food, staff and ambiance. Vegan or not this restaurant is a must! I'm a very picky foodie from LA and if your'e driving on the 101 and passing through Montecito, do yourself a favor and take the time to try Olivers, the food and presentation is amazing in a beautiful outdoor setting.
If you are a local, then you already know what a find the piece of paradise is...
I wish we had Olivers in LA, but it's worth the drive to Montecito, trust me.."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We went here for Valentine's Day and it was by far the best Vegan restaurant. From the ambiance to the food to the service. Everything was on point! I definitely recommend people people going here, even if you are not vegan."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Sorcery, this place is pure sorcery! We have been exploring vegan restaurants on the west coast all the way from San Francisco to San Diego, this place is the best, the real deal. The dishes are new and delicious, too bad they are about 5 hours south of SF, but totally worth a weekend visit every now and then!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"I was looking forward to this place thinking it was associated with Matthew kenney, but it is not. It had good stars so I was still hopeful. But the food was just nothing special... so heavy (which a lot of vegan places tend to be), but the flavors were just average. 

We had the artichoke flatbread, pad Thai, cauliflower, chocolate tart - all highly recommend and just very basic. 

I guess I went in with MK expectations and so I was disappointed. For a small town vegan restaurant and for someone who wants heartier food, this place would check the box. 

If I lived here, I may return and figure out which dishes are the better ones, but as someone who visits SB regularly, this place will not be on my list to repeat."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"What a wonderful dining experience! So many choices of unique vegan dishes. We started with the Brussel sprouts that were done with a maple Sherry glazed and sprinkled with chopped dates. Then on to artichoke ""crab cakes"" and two marvelous salads. We shared 3 entrees - the butternut squash ravioli. The Lotus bowls and the mushroom tostada. All were divine flavor explosions. The wait staff was attentive and very helpful with making suggestions. We are awaiting a chocolate tart and an apple crumble and  I know we won't be disappointed!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Took my 4 teenagers here for my birthday. We all agreed it was very good. Love that it's an upscale atmosphere and sophisticated decor. Too many vegan restaurants are ""hippy"" like, not bad but it's nice to have a fancy dinner place once in a while that is healthy food."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I was so impressed by this restaurant on all levels. 
I will break it down by service, food, and drinks.

The service was impeccable and the wait staff were very attentive, checking on our table about every 5 minutes which is the kind of service I expect from most good restaurants but rarely find. 

Our meal was just one hit after another. Truly. 
Every single dish we ordered was absolutely fantastic!!
The artichoke crab cakes with the amazing corn side, the Brussels sprouts, and the shishito peppers were what we tried this time and wow. Just wow. 
Each dish was perfectly made and delicious. 
I am more of a flexitarian, but these vegan dishes are making me think I could be happy as a vegan forever as long as I can keep eating their food!!

The cocktails also did not disappoint! 
I can honestly say, the cocktail I ordered here, the saged and confused (with modifications!! I ordered it without kombucha and in a martini glass) was hands-down the finest cocktail I have had in a year, and I have a cocktail somewhere at least 3-5 times a week. 
I mean truly magnificent. 
In fact, all of the cocktails we had were expertly crafted and perfect in every way. 

I cannot wait to come back to this place and give them all of my business. Our experience here was so great, I plant to recommend it to all of my friends and colleagues as well."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Literally the best cheeseburger I have ever had. It just happens to be vegan. It was unbelievably perfect in every single way. My taste buds are dancing. I am still processing...how did they make their vegan cheddar cheese taste better than nonvegan cheese? I challenge any meat eater to try this and not call it one of their best meals ever. The gorgonzola flat bread was so delicious and shocking how much it tastes like gorgonzola. The apple crisp with coconut ice cream was heavenly. Thank you, Olivers, for making kindness so delicious."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,The food was amazing! I had the jackfruit tacos and the Kung pao cauliflower. Everything was on the Spicy side. I would come back to try more! Beautiful seating area! Very refreshing.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Best place ever. The food is amazing. I shared a few dishes with my guest but everything was excellent. The cook tails were delightful and the ambiance is so magical.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Without exception, the most understated, hippest culinary and ambient delight in Montecito (in all of Santa Barbara, as far as that goes). Incredible tastes and presentation beyond words...If you're not on the plant- based wagon yet, you don't deserve to eat here. Thank you, Oliver's, for yet another amazing evening!  - Walter thanks you, too. You are all the best!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,My absolute fave place to eat near Santa Barbara. Vegan and hip with great food and service. Cant wait to return
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I'm not sure where to start.  This is a dream come true for me.  A vegan gourmet food place with a bar!! Honey... I'm home.  If I could seriously live here I would.  The servers and everyone around me were SO friendly and I loved the decor with the lights in the trees.  The food was so good my son was freaking out saying he will come back all the time for the crab cakes, Impossible burger and the apple crisp.  We cannot forget the most important part -? An animal was not hurt.  I always say anyone can cook with butter but if you can cook vegan, then you are a true chef!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The atmosphere and food were both incredible. They have a large, pretty patio, with comfortable seating and plenty of space between tables, so it was safe. The food was exceptional - not exceptional for vegan food - just exceptional.  

We split several plates - artichoke crab cakes, truffled potatoes, pad thai, and kung pao cauliflower. They were all excellent, but favorites were the crab cakes and the potatoes. We ended with the maple apple crumble with vegan vanilla ice cream and it was SO good. 

Great service. Seated us right on time. They have definitely figured out how to operate in this new world in which we live."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Great ambience, courteous service and well priced food. Good spot for dates, classy bar for friends or clients.

You will fully appreciate the restaurant only if you are vegetarian. I enjoyed the Risotto but not the Pad Thai. The apple cobbler with Coconut ice-cream was great."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Best restaurant in the Santa Barbra area. All plant based, but you wouldn't even know. We got the pad Thai, cauliflower, and crab cakes. Cauliflower is a must. Everything was so delicious I wish we were hungry enough to have ordered more!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Thanks to the entire staff, especially our wonderful server who took extra time to make us feel welcome, all the way from Tucson, AZ to celebrate our 39th wedding anniversary with our daughter and 3 grandchildren! To the chef, we absolutely loved the food! The shishito peppers, Brussels sprouts, ""crab"" cakes and the pretzel bun burger were not just delicious, but soooo pretty! And to top it off, the chocolate torte and key lime pie were delicious and beautifully served!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"From the moment you walk into this restaurant you feel the love. Phillip is the most welcoming and loving human being that I have ever encountered in a restaurant setting. He is what I expect from a vegan restaurant! It doesn't hurt that amid everything that is going on in our world (global pandemic, social injustices etc)  that this beautiful soul is our first impression of Oliver's. He is so appreciated! Not to mention the food is incredible, presentation is top notch and service is attentive! Phillip also shared with me that the owner and chef's philosophy is all about love in the details!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"SERVICE:  Left a lot to be desired. We went to Oliver's for lunch.  Only 4 tables were  occupied on the patio, lots of empty tables.  The waitress took our order and did not write down the one change we requested: No poblano peppers on the Beyond Burger.  This required waiting for the cook to prepare another one, as the hot pepper taste got all over the burger and made it inedible.   When paying $24 for an Oliver's burger, I'd like to think the waitress might pay attention, especially since the  restaurant was not busy at all.  The bus boy was more helpful than the waitress. She disappeared after the meals were served, but he helped make it right.  Of course, when it came time for a tip, she was most solicitous.  

SETTING:  The patio was beautiful and peaceful, and the bar was well-designed.  Pretty place to be.

FOOD:  The Oliver's burger, served on a pretzel bun with coconut ""bacon,"" was delicious.  It was my friend's birthday, and they did give her an apple crumble dessert on the house, so that helped a bit.

OVERALL:  To hit it out of the park, the food, atmosphere and service all need to be excellent, especially at a high end vegan restaurant.  I'm not inclined to rush back, based on the poor service. I can go to Mesa Verde if I'm craving vegan food, and it will be 1/3 the price."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We were walking around the town and saw the first vegan restaurant we've seen in a while. As lovers of eating healthy we wanted to go in and get some take out. With Our first step into the beautiful outdoor patio our breath was taken away. The ambiance of the restaurant was so beautiful and clam. Fabulous music, trees and soft wood and a calming smell filled the air. We walked over to the bar and met the most  kindest, funniest man. Billy. He is an incredible bartender with a lovely spirit who really made our evening. He then brought over a drink. It's called the Billy Billy. A sweet and spicy vegetable mezcal with a twist. And let me just tell you, if you don't get this drink when you get there you are making some bad life choices. Best vegan restaurant I've ever been too with an amazing crew and amazing energy."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I have been a Santa Barbara local my whole life and have always wanted to try this restaurant, I have only  heard amazing reviews and finally tried the place out. Not only was the food and service amazing! But the overall atmosphere of the place was magical! I'm definitely going to bring everybody I know here! Overall 5+ stars!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Eat here! 5 stars doesn't do this place justice. The food, service and ambiance were all stellar. We started with the Kung Pow cauliflower that was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. Onto the light and refreshing zucchini tomato tower that had pops of flavor.

The highlight was the mushroom ravioli. Tons of mushrooms in a delicious ""meat"" sauce over little pasta pockets of joy.

We wrapped up with the chocolate cake and apple crumble (we were on vacation celebrating our anniversary so why not two desserts?).. Given the choice I always go chocolate but this time the Apple crumble took center stage. 

The 90 minutes we were there flew by. Too bad we found this spot on our last night in town, it as our best meal of our trip and we had a few good ones."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Came here to grab some cocktails, and Billy served up some unique and delicious drinks. We had the Billy Billy with mezcal and special dragonfruit. Definitely recommend!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Artichoke crab cakes delish. Brussels sprouts excellent. Atmosphere beautiful. Pad Thai not great. Butternut squash ravioli not great as usually butter and cream are such rich flavors so texture odd. Will give another try as wild mushroom tostada sounds good.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"What a great experience from start to finish. We came here to celebrate after my wife and I got married and the staff did an AMAZING job making it special for us. The food was great and the ambiance was beautiful. 
It was also nice to see that they take COVID seriously and have all appropriate measures to ensure that we, the guests are safe and well taken care of. 

Kudos to Oliver's from a hospitality professional. 
-Javier"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,My only complaint is that I have to drive 2 1/2 hours to get to this restaurant. It is the best food I have ever eaten. We had the mushroom tostada and believed we went to heaven. I only wish they were located 100 miles to the south
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Wow, wow, wow!  We found this restaurant through American Express.  We are not vegan, but this restaurant is so good that we would become vegan if it was close to us!  One dish on the menu after another was AMAZING!  I don't think I've ever seen this many great options listed in one page.  The shishito peppers were the best we've ever tasted with the splash of lemon.  The pad thai was the most delicious from any Thai food restaurant we've tasted, the brussel sprouts were not bitter and were not oily, the crab cakes were addicting and the ambience and service was fantastic.  We were too full to order their flat bread, truffle potatoes, and lentil soup, but I wish I could have tried those because they looked soooo good! 10 stars from me (and my husband!)"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Wow!
I love it here!
The ravioli is so tasty I was almost scared to eat it. It tasted like real sausage meat. Service is fantastic and I really enjoyed myself!!
Spicy lemonade drink was addicting"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Came here a month or so ago for my fiancé's birthday. We decided to try coming at 9 PM on a Sunday, and they accommodated us right away. Beautiful patio seating, absolutely wonderful food and warm people. You won't regret it."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This place was just ""WOW"". We liked everything about the restaurant. Food, Service and Ambience.

We had booked a reservation for 7:30 pm on July 4 but showed up around 6:40 pm. The host was very accommodating and sat us down right away. We ordered Sweet Potato Wedges, Jackfruit Taco, Tomato Soup, Spinach and Artichoke flatbread, Pad Thai and Jalapeno Lemonade. Every item tasted fantastic. It's hard to choose a favorite since all dishes were sooo good! If we were forced to pick, I'd say Pad Thai and Flatbread were THE BEST- the play of veggies, sauces and spices is just perfect. For example, the subtle ginger and tamarind taste in Pad Thai makes you want more of it! Their lemonade is freshly made and was such a palate cleanser.

My wife and I went here with our 8 year old daughter. There were at least 2-3 other families with small kids. While they don't have a kids specific menu, kids can easily enjoy several items on the menu. My daughter just devoured the Pad Thai! This place is definitely kid friendly. Our waitress Natalie took care of all us really well (especially took care of our daughter!). 

Only one thing to note. Parking can be iffy- they have a shared parking space with Coast Village Inn. Do arrive early and make sure you find a good parking spot.

Overall, it was a great experience. We wish they open a second location in the Bay Area!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's is the best place on the central coast to experience a 100% vegan fine dining experience. The staff helps make the upscale experience come full circle. They helped me select a wonderful Pinot wine tonight from Niner Winery. They're signature cocktails never leave you feeling unsatisfied. They found the perfect blend of healthy cocktails. The Johnny 5 Alive should be the first choice of anyone who is a fan of spicy drinks. They're Pad Thai has been my favorite since I first ordered it. But I have also had the Oliver's burger, the jackfruit tacos the Kung Pao cauliflower and the tomato soup. Everything is absolutely delicious and comes with generous servings. We willingly drive all the way from Ventura just to treat ourselves."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Last night was my first time having dinner at Oliver's. All the staff had face masks and gloves. The host was able to seat us immediately without having a reservation. The servers were very kind and were attentive. Our server was friendly and took the time to speak about the food and specials they offer. The dishes were absolutely delicious. I am definitely coming back in the future. Thanks so much to all the staff for being so wonderful.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is my new favorite restaurant in the SB area. I'm not vegan but I do try to eat a more plant based diet, so places like Oliver's are a god send! The ambience is amazing, cocktails are creative and the food was so fresh and flavorful. Highly recommend."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Wow!! Love this restaurant. . The lights in the tree are fantastic and create a really nice ambiance. All of the food was good. Highlights include crab cakes, ceviche , and artichokes! Overall super impressed and will definitely be back."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,Sadly overrated. The impossible burger was so bland.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Our party of four arrived to Oliver's at 8:20 PM, they were scheduled to close at 8:30 PM for a private event. Phil greeted us and promptly explained the situation, but encouraged us to dine in and offered to put our order in right away with a welcoming smile. One of our appetizers had been 86'd, so Phil provided us with a complimentary appetizer AND recommended a similar appetizer to the one we ordered (and already placed it for us!) The service provided by the entire staff was friendly, the food and desert was above and beyond, and Phil was an absolute gem."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Absolutely amazing atmosphere and food! The best part is that the majority of the menu was gluten free. Which is perfect for my diet and it was easy to find something delicious! We enjoyed the truffle potatoes, pear and Gorgonzola flatbread, and the Pad Thai! Will be back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Very pretty location, love the vibes. Food was yummy. I got the sausage flat bread, pink drink, and cauliflower to start. Rest of the family got the other flatbreads, Thai curry, pad Thai, and burger. For food I would stick to the flat breads :)"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Staying in Santa Barbara and was excited to see a new restaurant with Vegan options. Oliver's atmosphere and beer/cocktail selection were great but the food didn't live up to expectations. The two of us ordered the Kung Pow cauliflower, Margarita flatbread and Pad Thai. The cauliflower was fantastic but the flatbread tasted like rancid oil. The Pad Thai had nice flavor but was essentially just julienne cut vegetables in a pool of broth. The service was also lackluster with us having to flag down a different server for our check (after our initial server couldn't be found). We truly wanted to like this place but can't recommend it after the meal we had. We were left with much to be desired."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This place is absolutely fantastic! The staff is so welcoming and friendly. Billy was wonderful!! 
Our drinks and food were amazing! If you're near Santa Barbara, this is a must-try!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I came here on a Saturday evening and sat on the patio where the trees were adorned with hanging white lights to create a lovely ambiance. The background music was cool and I was happy to see they allowed dogs to join the party. I had a perfect view of the whole restaurant as well as the bar area, which was hopping but not distracting. 

Everyone I encountered was friendly and the place had a chill, positive vibe. My server, Moriah, was very sweet, kept checking in on me, and apologized for the short delay in getting my food, but I didn't mind at all since I was happy to relax in such a beautiful setting. 

I didn't order any wine but their filtered water hit the spot. I ordered the artichoke crab cakes, which lived up to the hype. There were a lot of amazing flavors with the spicy aioli sauce and generous serving of seasoned corn with cherry tomatoes and arugula. I also had a side of brussels sprouts, which were sweetened with dates and a maple sherry glaze, and I enjoyed that dish as well. I left satiated and hope to try some of their other dishes on my next visit."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Parking: paid valet or park for free across the street. 
Restaurant Ambiance is beautiful, romantic and quiet. Perfect for a date or celebration. 
Dog friendly patio. 
Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. 
Food presentation is on point. 
Had the khng pao cauliflower (so good), spinach and artichoke flatbread (deeelish) along with the Greek salad. 
Average dish is about $14 and worth every penny. 

My new favorite plant based spot."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The potato soup is very good and hearty. The Pad-Thai tastes also very healthy and the dough is very chewy and yummy. The zucchini tour is not that hot, it is cold and very simple to my taste and the presentation of it is lacking of artistry with these very big chunks of Tomato slices. I wish the portions were a bit bigger. The atmosphere is nice and the music is soft. I would come back."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Amazing food and ambiance. Great service. Would recommend to anyone! Loved the brussel sprouts, shishito peppers, and pad Thai."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Perfection. Would not change a thing. Had the beach bum cocktail. To me it was too strong...BUT! I'm not a drinker so the average person would probably love it.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Went to celebrate a special occasion from LA. It's a very good restaurant less chaos like all the restaurants in LA. The servers were very attentive and service was great. We ordered lot of items for the party of four. Good was nice and drinks too. Only taking of a star because I found that restaurant has a potential to change the internal furniture as the chairs were extremely dirty and tables too. That they could have covered but the chairs needs replacement to complete the fine dining experience. I won't invite anyone for a Spl occasion here considering it's not inviting as the chairs were dirty, bu hey that's all the restaurant In LA..(mist dirtiest and ugliest couch witnessed at Perch LA) 
For sharing: 
1. Peppers- It was just ok. Least favorite amongst rest. 
2. Crab Cakes- Delicious 
3. Tomato Zucchini shower- delicious nothing out of the world but tasty. 
4. Flatbread pears and Aragua- tasty but I would have preferred less Arugula on top it was too crowded because of it. 
5. Pad Thai- Delicious
6. Finger potatoes- nice and crispy
7. Dark chocolate cake it was complimentary for the celebration but we ended up ordering one extra."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I got the Vegan Burger with a lettuce substitute.

It was excellent- full of flavor, loved my side salad as well.
Eventually it started falling apart so I ate the burger with a folk and knife on top of the salad. 
Would recommend!!

Thank you to my waitress Ana. You were great!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,The food was delicious. We went at sunset and the only complaint I have is the sun burning my eyes out! Where they sat us was so uncomfortable. I feel for the upscale restaurant it is that should had not of Been something that was so difficult to fix. The prices are very high for the portions. The food is wonderful and the quality is great. Either expect to eat after or spend upwards of 200+ for 4 people
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"What an amazing place. Carly, our server was truly the best!  I am not Vegan  it my Partner is. I think I may have loved this place even more than he did. The ambience, service and food are all top notch. This place is definitely a must for vegans and non-vegans. Come to this restaurant--you won't be sorry."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's has a wonderful patio that's very Carmel. It's opulent and upscale and feels like you're hanging out in the woods with Clint Eastwood on his patio. There's no evidence of the former Peabody's burger joint that used to inhabit the space. 

The menu is all vegan, so I took my vegan friend. We split the artichoke crab cakes, apple salad, and truffle potatoes. We also shared the chocolate dessert offering, and we each had a cocktail. 

In order, we liked the potatoes, followed by the apple salad and crab cakes last. I'm not vegan, so I really missed the crab!

The chocolate dessert was fabulous. The drinks were solid, but nothing to rave about. The drink menu seemed heavy on tequila and I was in a bourbon mood, so I didn't try a special drink.

The bill came to $87 without the tip for 3 small plates, a dessert and 2 cocktails. Too expensive for eating there often and I don't see it lasting too long.

I'd give the food 3 stars, but the atmosphere is easily what you come here for and this the 4th star. For the best vegan food in town, I'll stick with Mesa Verde, but I'm sure I'll be back to Oliver's for an afternoon on that gorgeous patio again."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Finely after years of anticipation we have a new go to restaurant in Montecito. It was worth the wait. Service was impeccable, food was gorgeous generous and delicious, and the decor very comfortable and chic. 
I hope that it being a plant based menu only won't deter to many people. It's a welcome for our family but some people may be up against a meat and potato guy who won't anywhere they can't get a steak. Hog tie them and bring them anyway. Maybe you can change their deadly dietary habits.
Seriously ... Thank You Oliver's and congrats on the success of bringing such a lovely restaurant to our little town."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Absolutely wonderful restaurant! My husband and I had fantastic time during our dinner last night. As soon as we arrived we were mesmerized by the gorgeous decor and the lights on the trees. We were warmly greeted by Philip at the front desk and we were seated at a lovely table on the outside patio. Our meal was incredible! Soup, jackfruit taco, burger and slice of chocolate cake for dessert. The entire menu is vegan, so there is no guessing or worrying about any animal products being present in your food. Our server Kelly was friendly and on point! Philip kindly answered our questions about the restaurant and the cuisine. He explained they use minimally processed items and source locally wherever possible. Simply fantastic experience! Romantic setting, excellent ambiance, delicious food. Highly recommend!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Every time Oliver's is 5/5 stars! The best restaurant in Montecito. The staff is always great too and the atmosphere is perfect. The interior design is beautiful and I highly recommend stopping at Olivers. They're only open for dinner and get very busy but you can make reservations or order to go!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,We were there last night and ordered a bunch of small plates. We loved the ambience and every plate. Excellent vegan food! Try the Oliver burger!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Went to Olivers with a friend for an early Sunday night dinner. We split an appetizer and ordered separate main courses. My friend was extremely disappointed in her main course. We both ended-up with what appears to be mild food poisoning with body aches, tightness in the chest and headaches. We will not return."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Amazing vegetarian dining in a beautiful and relaxing atmosphere ... Oliver's was a pleasant surprise.  Everything we sampled was delicious and offered a wide range of flavors ... from the pear and arugula flatbread, pad thai noodles, to the key lime pie finish. This should be on everyone's Go-To restaurant while visiting Santa Barbara."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Delicious food! Although I am a meat eater, Oliver's has become one of our favorite restaurants in town. The shishito peppers and jackfruit tacos are incredible. I could seriously eat here a few times per week."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Not friendly and overly expensive for half cooked vegetables. Super excited about the Ravioli , but the tomato sauce tasted canned. Nice atmosphere. That's what you are paying for."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Billy (bartender) was a great host while I was seated at the bar. The food here is very difficult to discern from non vegan dishes. Billy made me a bourbon and paradise which was a great alternative to the Moscow mule and old fashioned I usually get. It was a mix of chamomile, bourbon, brown sugar, and other flavors. It was great!! As for the dishes, the ravioli, crab cakes, bhan mi, and cauliflower Kung pao chicken were flavorful and delicious. The bhan mi was my favorite but I wouldn't pass on the king pao chicken. I highly recommend this place. The chef and  and Billy the bartender are great at their craft."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"came in for dinner last Thursday and our server natalie was superb. her suggestions were completely on point and the wine she suggested to pair with our food was perfect. all the good was great, except the cauliflower was a little spicy for our tasting. 10/10 for ambience and service. 9/10 for food. will certainly be back for the exceptional service natalie offered as well as the beautiful ambience and delicious food!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My bf and I had reservations here for a Saturday evening to celebrate our one year anniversary.  

There was valet parking and ample street parking.

We arrived 15 minutes early and waited at the bar while our table on the patio was being prepared. Our table was ready within 5 minutes... complete with a flower arrangement that my bf has ordered from Montecito Flowers and coordinated with Oliver's to have ready for our arrival.  The patio was beautiful, comfortable, and relaxing with music playing from speakers, string lighting and heaters.  They also had blankets available to keep you warm. 

The menu included a wide variety of vegan options that all looked delicious and creative.  We opted for Crab Cakes, Brussel Sprouts, Truffle Potatoes, Wild Mushroom Tostada, and Impossible Burger.  For desert, we had the Blueberry Crumble.  Everything came out in a timely manner and was delicious!  The Crab Cakes were lite and tasty.  The tostada was also lite and flavorful esp since I love mushrooms.  The burger was huge. My bf who is not a vegetarian said it tasted like a real burger.  

Service was exceptional!  Everyone was professional, courteous, attentive, and personable.

The two restrooms were unisex, single user restrooms.   They were clean and spacious. 

Prices were reasonable.

We loved Oliver's.  We will definitely be back to try more menu items.  

Solid 5 for a vegan restaurant!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We had the perfect night here. First of all, it's a dog friendly upscale restaurant, which you don't find every day. The patio is gorgeous with live trees and beautiful hanging lights. The waitstaff was professional and attentive and so nice to our dogs. And the FOOD was delicious! We had the kung pao cauliflower, the crab cakes, and the Oliver burger with truffle potatoes and all were amazing. We were scraping our plates clean! For dessert we had a strawberry rhubarb crumble with coconut sorbet--sooo good. Another nice touch--since it was our anniversary they gave us the dessert on the house. We will be back for future celebrations! It was the perfect place to dine and celebrate with our dogs."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,So my sister and I stopped by the other day after we went to the hot springs and WOW! I think this is some of the best vegan food I have ever ate! Super tasty! The Pad Thai is the best I have ever ate. They use pistachios instead of peanuts amazing! The kung pow cauliflower amazing! They used cashews instead of peanuts yummy! You should definitely get the combination together. It will blow your mind! It's that good! We asked our waitress what was the wow factor dishes and she took care of us! I would eat here everyday if I didn't live in Santa Monica. I can't wait to make a trip back to your yummy delicious vegan restaurant!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Love that this restaurant exists and relieved to hear it was just a recent rumor about closing! All the food I've had here has been excellent and they are able to accommodate substitutions/ requests which is great. The staff is both attentive and knowledgeable which makes the experience enjoyable. Good bartender too and they all seem to,have awareness of the customer and their needs. Always a pleasant experience. Thank you, Oliver's!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,We had terrific new year's eve dinner at Oliver's.  The ambience was lovely and the food was outstanding.  I had the Pad Thai and the artichoke crab cakes.  Both were delicious!  Got the lotus bowl to go and that was mighty tasty too!! Even my omnivore husband thought the meals were excellent.  The food was fresh and creatively put together.  We plan to go back and invite everyone we know to come with us!!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Once again, Oliver's hits it out of the park. Food, service and atmosphere are top notch"

iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"First time there, and we had Carly as our server.  I managed restaurants for years, and I was EXTREMELY picky about my servers.  Carly was fantastic, and I would have poached her in a heartbeat if I were still in business.  And the food was absolutely fantastic.  Get the tomato and zucchini tower.  It sounds meh, bit it was delicious!  Next time we're in town, we're definitely coming back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Fancy restaurant for sure, but their dishes are skimpy and really nothing to write home about. The service was also lacking. Again a bit snooty all around which is unfortunate because I was really excited to try this place for my birthday dinner."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"LOVED it!

Spectacular physical restaurant.
Amazing, friendly, professional, lovely employees from the host to the servers to the guy busing the tables.
Scrumptious vegan food (mushroom tostada, avocado toast, pad Thai, apple crumble and an amazing dark ale)
Incredible location right on the hip strip in Montecito."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I left this restaurant speechless. The food exceeded my expectations, that was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The atmosphere was great the restaurant was beautiful and the service was incredible. My server Natalie was so amazing and sweet she was so helpful and everything she recommended ended up being our favorite dishes! I will recommend this place to everybody!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Excellent food. The portions are generous and delicious. The outdoor patio is beautiful.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Absolutely INCREDIBLE. 
Delicious small plates and cocktails beneath a canopy of lit trees... a Beautiful dining experience!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's lives up to its reviews!

Okay... so I am not a vegetarian nor a vegan. Actually I'm pretty much a carnivore. Literally I don't know if I've ever had a meat-free dinner. 

What was so crazy about these dishes is that they made you feel satisfied and full with no meat. These are by no means simple dishes. They used
spices and veggies and everything blended in such a nice way.

The outdoor patio is nice and you don't feel like COVID is taking away from the experience really."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Yes yes yes! I had to support the new vegan restaurant in Santa Barbara there is so few! I had zucchini flatbread and the ravioli both were awesome I definitely would recommend and will be returning
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Tasty, inventive vegan food. Try the flatbreads and pad thai. Great service. Great space."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"First of all , the fact that there's an upscale restaurant with an all vegan menu is something to celebrate in and of itself. This place gets full points on ambiance and service. Very friendly and hospitable staff ! The food is not too bad  but unfortunately not elevated. The crab cakes were well executed and quite tasty. The shishito peppers were extremely tangy - I get that there's lemon tamari in it , but it was far too pronounced in it's expression. The cauliflower was not the star in the kung pao cauliflower dish. And whoa, was it saucy ! Maybe it was on me to eat it last , but once it was on the plate , it pretty much imparted it's overpowering essence on every other dish we ate after . Maybe dial down the sauce so that there can still be harmony between all the dishes ordered? (And also spare the poor cauliflower from having an identity crisis ?) And the truffle potatoes were mediocre - nothing to write home about and not very "" truffley "". The wild mushroom tostada was quite good , but not good enough to atone for the sins of the dishes that came before sadly ... Is this place worth a visit ? Yes absolutely but if you're looking for culinary artistry , you will be disappointed. I would want to rate them a 3.5 but since that's not an option here , I will have to go with a 3. I will end on the note that they did show promise and I sincerely wish them the best and hope they can attain the superlative level of excellence that's still rare for plant based cuisine."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Food is excellent, service is slow. I would go back just in case the slow service was unusual because the food tastes fabulous."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I found this on Yelp initially and the food looked great...
Made reservations to come here to eat dinner....
Definitely would consider this High End Vegan - Plant Based restaurant!
Ordered Kung Pao Cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts, Wild Mushroom Tostada and Artichoke ""Crab Cakes""...
Everything was great...overall I would say my favorite was the Tostada and I would get that again and again!
The crab cakes had the consistency of what I recall crab cakes being like, but the Spicy Aioli was a bit too spicy even more so than the cauiflower dish itself which Kung Pao dishes are normally spicy...
Service was great...."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,AMAZING! We are visiting from out of state and were beyond impressed with Oliver's. I own a vegan restaurant in Texas so I am a little bit of a food snob if you will. I've traveled all over the country trying vegan food and Oliver's was simply fantastic. Full of flavor and very creative dishes (the Pad Thai did have a bit too much black pepper but still great). Our bartender Billy was wonderful. He was knowledgeable and kind. The ambiance was also lovely. Truly a great experience through and through.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"3.5 stars but rounded up because nice staff and ambiance. Review from out of town: This is a nice restaurant to dine with friends or family. Mainly outdoor seating with pretty lights. 
The music was okay, but not what I'd expect for this dining experience. No biggie. 
I've been here twice. The cocktails are amazing!!! 
I've gotten saged and confused both times. It's delicious! 
I've ordered the pad Thai both times. The first time I was there later in the evening, after 9. The pad Thai was okay, but more like a Chinese stir fry. However, going at 5 pm the second really changed the experience for the food. It showed how much energy the chefs had compared to late evening, which is understandable. The pad Thai I received second experience here was much more tasty and better presentation! I would like a little more noodles as it's a lot of peppers, but still very good. I'll probably order again when I'm back in Santa Barbara. The Kung pao cauliflower is the best thing I've tasted on the menu! We also enjoyed the crab cakes, sweet potatoes, and artichokes. 
Also, I'm celiac,  have dined twice and had no bad reactions for those with gluten allergy/intolerance.
Prices are a bit high for what you get, but the dining experience is very nice, and they allowed us to have our dog which is a super plus! 
The only feedback I'd hope they receive is we ordered a couple of desserts. I got a chocolate tarte and I tasted onion in the first bites, then it quickly goes away. But basically it means, they probably refrigerate the dessert with onion or maybe garlic in the fridge and it affected the taste of the dessert. So hopefully, they see this and prevent that for future diners, but overall good business to eat for vegans, gluten free, and groups."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's is such a cute restaurant! 
We were very pleased with the entire experience. 
The staff was amazing-  attentive and friendly. 
The outdoor ambiance is beautiful with outdoor lighting and fire pits that creates an intimate setting. There were plenty of heat lamps around to keep you warm. There is also indoor seating too! 

For dinner we had the artichoke flatbread, tomato salad, and jackfruit tacos... they were all very tasty! Oliver's is also family friendly, they had high chairs for children. They also offered pasta or cheese pizza for children to eat. 

I would definitely come back to Oliver's again. It's a great place for a nice dinner as a couple, family, or even a date night with drinks at the bar. Aesthetically, the bar was incredibly chic. I loved it. To note: parking is on the street from what I am aware, not in the actual plaza as it is saved for hotel guests there."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"COVID: Face mask required to enter. All employees were wearing face masks. Very spaced out seating. 


A fancy vegan restaurant. We walked in and loved the ambiance of this place. Has plenty of out door seating, string lights and heated lamps. We opted to dine inside because we were too cold. I loved the music that was playing. Some old school pop and remixes. 

Food: we ordered three small plates to share. 
1. Bolognese pasta had a great texture in the noodles. We enjoyed the Bolognese and didn't miss the meat at all! It was a pretty big dish. 
2. Jackfruit Taco came with one big one filled to the rim. The mixture of flavors was great, a mix of sweet and some beans. The sauce had a slight kick. 
3. The crab cakes had a nice outter crunch although it doesn't necessarily remind us of an actual crab cake. The corn and arugula added the sweet to balance off the ending kick of spicy from the aioli sauce. 

Very nice service although our waiter wasn't as attentive towards the end and we waited a bit to get our check. 

Overall, may only come again to bring a vegan friend. I personally didn't find the food wanting me to come back."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Such a cute spot, which is truly unassuming from the outside. Once you walk-in, the open spacious seating is wonderful and such a pleasant surprise. Seating and initial service was a little slow and sloppy, however our primary server was great. 

The menu and food, are really, just okay. Having Kung Pao Cauliflower on the same menu as tacos is just odd. Even though it's a vegan restaurant there can still be a theme. I could've made the Kung Pao myself and can not believe it was $15 for that. I'm from San Francisco and am used to over-paying, this just doesn't make sense. The jackfruit tacos were pretty good, well proportioned, and honestly would've paid $15 for those and $8 for cauliflower florets and cashews. The crab cakes were just okay. Maybe we ordered the wrong items?

The mocktails aren't mocktails, they are juice blends, there's a difference. The overall air at the entire restaurant is a little snotty, not welcoming. We've eaten at several restaurants on the strip before, multiple times, and at much nicer restaurants than this. So that's disappointing. 

Since we're both vegan, we'll likely return but hopefully a better option pops-up soon."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This place has a great vibe - and the layout is fantastic.- indoor / outdoor open area - music level was good - nice lighting at night. Staff is A+friendly

A Vegan loves it when you are not limited to a few items on the bottom corner of the menu. Everything here is VEGAN and like a Doc Holiday said ""I'm your Hucklebery!""

We kicked it off with the artichoke crab cakes and loved it. I have to say the corn and arugula  were the scene stealer like Akwafina in Crazy Rich Asians!

Shishito peppers came out next and they did not disappoint. The sauce at the bottom was delicious and we mixed them in with our other share plates.

They replace your plates and utensils between share plates without you even asking - nice touch.

Closed the show with Pad Thai - nice encore - we needed some volume and it delivered . Great mix of vegetables and noodles - very tasty.

My only regret is we should have swapped out the peppers for ravioli and the reason is - we only had two of us for the peppers 1 I recommend 4+peppers There is a lot of peppers!

So I have a plan for next Visit! Make sure you get out there. It is great!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Beautiful restaurant in Montecito! Came here for a special birthday celebration and had a wonderful time. The outside seating is lovely, with lots of trees and hanging lights. Our party was all vegetarian so it was super nice to be able to choose from anything on the menu. We sat outside and the weather cooperated (with a few heat lamps added in). The drinks were specially crafted and tasty. They have a good mocktail selection too. The food was family style for us and we really liked the ""crab"" cakes and ravioli. So so good and would return just for those dishes! The apple salad was a hit too! The corn salad with the crab cakes were spiced with mint - very good! It's a pricy place for a special occasion but definitely worth a visit. Street parking was pretty easy to find. Make a reservation in advance if you can."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This restaurant totally blew me away! I have never been to such a high quality vegan restaurant, it was an amazing experience! The ambiance was absolutely beautiful with the beautiful bar, and outdoor trees with hanging lights. The bartender Billy was awesome, as well as all the staff with amazing service. I cannot say anything bad about this place - really if you are from out of town and want the best vegan dining experience with the best food you have to go to Oliver's."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,This place is a scam. I made a reservation for my best friends 25th birthday and an 20 mins before we were going to leave they said they were canceling for rain but it hasn't even rained so don't go. The car isn't even wet I'm pretty sure the manager Phyllis lied about her name no 20 year old is named Phyllis anymore. It was rude and unprofessional. We were really excited for the vegan food. She feels like her birthday was ruined because we came all the way to Santa Barbara 3 hr drive
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Sat at the bar and watched Monday Night Football.  We had the Johnny 5 Alive drink, absolutely the best.  The small plates and flat breads are so flavorful, we didn't miss meat.  Brett, our bartender gave us excellent service.  I wish this restaurant was in the Bay Area!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"I was truly offended coming here. Let me start with my first experience, I went with my boyfriend's mom. We had dinner and drinks. To be honest, I don't really remember the food. It was fine, but nothin special. Drinks were good, service was good.

But then on my birthday, my boyfriend and I went and were hoping to get drinks at the bar for an hour or so. We went in, it couldn't have been later than 4pm, and asked to be seated. The host looked my boyfriend and I up and down then told us he couldn't seat us until 8pm. Every single seat at the bar was open and several tables were as well. I asked if those were reserved and without looking inside, or at a list of reservations, he said that they were. We pressed a bit about the seats at the bar but he would not seat us. 

We don't fit the demographic of their usual cliental, we're in our twenties and I'm black, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's their unofficial policy to not seat people who look like us. I wouldn't post this if I truly thought that they were all booked up and he genuinely wasn't able to seat us. Won't ever be coming back here."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,Overpriced for 1 order of wet Brussels and 1 order of 7 truffle potatoes = $35 - containers made them so soggy we through the Brussel sprouts out- the potato's were delicious they soggy. Do not get to-go here. Dining in might be better. Guess this vegan girl has to keep looking.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Another great visit!

Dined here today with 5 others for my birthday.  This was my first visit back since the pandemic.  Indoor dining was closed but outdoor dining was thriving.  Social distancing was in place and employees were masked.  

The menu was as extensive as it was pre-pandemic.  This time were ordered 3 Artichoke Crab Cakes, 2 Mushroom Tostadas, Brussel Sprouts, 3 Impossible Burgers, a bowl of Butternut Squash Soup, Spinach and Artichoke Flatbread, Ravioli, 2 cabs and a Billy Billy.  

As usual, everything came out quickly and was amazing!  We ordered our favorites so we knew what to expect.  The only new items we ordered was the ravioli and the flatbread.  The flatbread was my favorite dish. The ravioli was really good but filling. 

Service was up to par and outstanding.  Our server, Lyle S., was friendly, helpful and attentive.

Oliver's is a solid, consistently good destination restaurant."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"There is nothing like this! I went with an open mind and came out a loving and devoted patron. 

The seating area is very cute- we sat outside by a heater and the view was gorgeous. The wine selection is incredible and they have fun cocktails too. Service is also outstanding and very quick. 

We ordered three things to share: the tomato zucchini starter, the cauliflower, and the pad thai. The tomato zucchini starter was PHENOMENAL! I could not believe it was vegan and essentially just a pile of veggies. The sauces were incredible- this completely scratched our pasta itch and didn't even taste that healthy even though it was completely raw. The cauliflower was also incredibly decadent, something even a devout meat eater would love. The pad thai was also incredible but definitely more noticably veggie heavy. 

This is a place I'd feel more than comfortable taking non-vegans, as they have so much variety and incredible flavor in all the dishes. I can't WAIT to go back!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Ok, my boyfriend and I have been vegan for 9 years and we have never had vegan food this good. Everything we had was flavorful and filling. We shared brussels sprouts, mushroom ravioli, and ""crab"" cakes small plates along with a salad and we couldn't even finish it all. We managed to squeeze in the dessert though, a chocolate torte which was beyond words..it melted in our mouthes.

The drinks we had were also excellent. We'll definitely come back again.

The service was exceptional and the atmosphere was comfortable. We sat outside where there were plenty of heaters, nice ambient lighting, and glass above the edge of the deck railing so it's less windy."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Delicious vegetarian food. The Pad Thai and veggie burger were both very yummy. We liked this place so much we visited twice in one trip!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Great ambiance, delicious drinks made with locally sourced cold pressed juice and friendly staff. Kelly at the bar makes a great margarita as well ! I appreciate the various considerations for food sensitivities. I sat at the bar and ordered the ginger green beans, pad Thai and ""crab"" cakes. All pretty good but did not find my grand slam dish during that visit. Portions on the small side. Overall food is pricey but the attention to detail to each plate helps make up for what's lacking ( compliments to the chef) . I would like to see more plate options and bigger portions! A happy hour wouldn't hurt either! 

A week after dining I ordered a vegan/gf chocolate cake to go for a friends birthday. It was around $40 and it came in slices ( they are not quite set up for to go yet) and in several boxes. BUT in the end it tasted incredible so nobody minded."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We love this restaurant so much, we actually just held our wedding dinner and reception here last weekend! :) The food is 10/10, ambiance and decor 10/10, and the staff is 10/10! I would give this place 10 stars if I could! HIGHLY recommend, especially if you're a new vegan and wanting to try new things! My favorites on the menu are the truffle potatoes, wild mushroom tostada, pad thai, and veggie burger! They have an apple crumble for dessert that's phenomenal as well! 

Thanks for being so amazing Oliver's! We will be back again very soon! xx"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"OMG! This restaurant is a real gem! The atmosphere is beautiful and the food is easily the best vegan food in the West coast. We had truffle potatoes, a jackfruit taco, mushroom ravioli and a Thai curry as well as dessert. Everything was incredibly delicious - the flavors were absolutely spot on!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Always such an amazing experience here at Olivers. Can not thank Carly enough for being such an excellent server last night! Oliver's burger and the apple crumble are to die for!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"I can't believe how many amazing reviews this place has. I got the spinach artichoke flatbread and the veggie burger. Both are presented beautifully and the server is really nice. 
They both don't taste like anything. I had to ask for salt so I could try to bring some flavor out. Really overpriced and flavorless. I'm sitting at the restaurant now and I'm going to grab some other food when I leave."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I'm a full-time vegan for over two years now. I'm feeling so much better than I did before making the change from the Standard American Diet (SAD). I also feel good that no animals have to suffer or die just so I can enjoy a cheese burger.

None of my family or friends are vegan, so I used my birthday as an excuse to get them to have dinner at Oliver's in Montecito. Only my sister-in-law whined when she found out I chose a vegan restaurant for my birthday dinner. But, afterwards even she said she really liked it.

We started off with a few appetizers. The ones I recall were the Roasted Garlic Hummus and Artichoke ""Crab Cakes"". I think we also got the Margherita Flatbread. No complaints.

Two of us got the Impossible Burger and one got the Pad Thai. I don't recall the other dishes we ordered. I have to be honest, I was not blown away by the Impossible Burger. I make a Beyond Meat burger at home that I think tastes even better. My friend said he enjoyed his Pad Thai, but he didn't elaborate or really rave about it. 

For me, the architecture and decor is the best part of Oliver's. There's a beautiful balance between upscale and casual that I think is hard to achieve. They did it. Comfortable, laid-back elegance. If my review were based solely on the architecture and interior design, they'd get a solid five stars.

Also, everyone we had any contact with on staff was first class. Not pretentious or snooty.

The major shortcoming of Oliver's is the lack of variety on the menu and the so-so quality of the food. It's only okay, and definitely not worth the high prices. I would strongly suggest the management and kitchen staff take a trip to Little Pine in Silver Lake and take lots of notes. Maybe steal several of the recipes. If Oliver's food could match the variety and tasty quality of Little Pine, they'd be the world champion of vegan restaurants. 

I would really like to see more 100% vegan restaurants in Santa Barbara. I'm also hoping more regular restaurants will add top quality vegan options to their menus so I could eat out more often with friends and family. Restauranteurs take note: the vegan population is growing every day."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The Quick: Vegan or not this restaurant was incredible and I can't wait to return. Food was extremely flavorful, drinks were fabulous and strong, and the ambiance and service was top notch. A true 5 Star

The Details: I'll admit I was a bit skeptical going to a vegan restaurant, how could anything work without cheese after-all? Do I love meat? Yes. Do I love Oliver's? H*ll yes! The shishito peppers were incredible, why doesn't every place make them like this? Everything else was delicious as well but that really stole the show for me. 

Ambience was amazing. Classy, fun, yet low key $$$ at the same time. Everything is locally sourced, organic, or something impressive like that. Plus the host was phenomenal and our waitress was lovely. Will absolutely return. 

The Damage: It was affordable yet pricey for vegetables. Worth it!!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,I am not a vegan person but I always wanted to try Oliver's and yes this restaurant is absolutely fantastic with beautiful outdoor patio full of trees and plants
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's is a must visit each time we come to Montecito/Santa Barbara. We happened on this place during a visit to SB and fell in love right away. It's just one of those restaurants that sweeps you off your feet. 
Our server was best in class. He was passionate about his job and the food, offering us great recommendations which made our experience very special. 
And the food was just so wonderful. The dishes were so well done from the plating to the colors and the mix of textures; it was truly a great food experience. 
Whether you're vegan or not, this place is a must visit!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Excellent restaurant, service, ambience, location and best of all delicious food preparations using plant based conscious ingredients.  5 star all the way.

Parking was challenging.  Oddly all the spaces surrounding the restaurant are marked ""for hotel only, no restaurant parking"" despite everything looking like it's on the same property and the stalls being contiguous to the restaurant"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Whether you are a vegan or not , the food is delicious at Oliver's! The ambience is lovely too.  They have a nice outdoor space and a good bar. The service was attentive. I enjoyed their wine selection - lots of good options. There is a small parking lot behind the restaurant or across the street, there is also parking available.  This is a good place to order several dishes or appetizers and then share so you can try different things.  Also , don't skip trying one of their desserts ! The chocolate cake is like fudge and goes really well with that last sip of red wine.  We enjoyed everything about our evening at Oliver's."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oliver's is great! I've been finding myself in a couple of vegan spots lately and I'm not vegan by any stretch of the imagination. I'm one of those who will not dare consume an animal product in my coffee drinks, like could not pay me any amount of money in the world to drink cows milk - but will devour an entire block of cheese a couple hours later.

I eat what I want, when I want but my sister is Vegan and I'm totally not opposed to others living that life. I bake a bunch of vegan items and I really do love a lot of vegan options but the commitment to an entire lifestyle isn't right for me.

I'd asked my bestie if we could grab dinner at Oliver's on our way home the other night. We usually eat brekke at Jeannine's or grab coffee and pastries in Montecito on our way out to wine tasting in Los Olivos but we are never quite in need for dinner on the return because we've either already eaten a bit sooner than we hit Coast Village Rd. or I've way overdid it on McConnell's froyo stop a couple exits before here.

Either way, I knew I wanted to grab dinner so I intentionally asked the gal at McConnell's to only give me half of my froyo order because I needed to fit in dinner tonight.

My bestie is definitely not vegan so I didn't mention to him this restaurant was and as it got closer to dinner, I simply suggested this spot might be ""vegetarian"" I didn't want to totally scare him off of the idea.

We'd eaten a late lunch and ordered a few plates to share which was plenty!

We shared the Apple Salad, Kung Pao Cauliflower and Spinach & Artichoke Flatbread.

All three dishes were very yummy. We both really enjoyed the salad, but agreed that the Spinach & Artichoke flatbread was our fav. It was super filling and would be a great share for a larger dining party.

As much as I wanted to try dessert and under normal circumstances would have totally tried to do dessert (my froyo) before and dessert after dinner, my dessert stomach was already full and we had to table that one for our next visit.

Service was great, the salad came out quickly and the other dishes seemed to take a bit longer but it was a Sunday evening and we had no place else in the world to be so it didn't matter much.

We'll definitely return in the future. This is a great option if you are staying in the area or passing through and want a really scrumptious meal in a nice calm atmosphere.

It was a chilly night and as lovely as the patio was I wanted to cozy up in a corner booth and keep warm indoors. The patio seems perfect for warmer evenings.

Plenty of street parking out front."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Actually this would be a 4 star place at least but I was a little disappointed in the menu options and the prices were really expensive.  I came here during lunch so maybe dinner would be a different experience but overall the place was empty and it felt like you were the whole focus of the staff which was nice to get the attention but it felt like you were seated at a country club event waiting for the invited guests to arrive.

Menu was all vegan but kind of ordinary.  I was really surprised they don't even make their own burger in house as this is suppose to be a high end restaurant. Their Oliver burger is basically a Beyond Meat burger on a pretzel bun with a side of chips.  We are talking $24 for such dish and I just didn't think no how gourmet they tried to make it I can't see how that blow away my vegan sensory taste buds that high.  Saw they had 3 different salads but 2 of them had sweet stuff in them like dates and apples.  I saw they had a Chinese chicken salad with  jackfruit that sounded interesting and a Tuna Melt with chickpea Tuna that looked ok so asked the nice waitress which she recommended.  She basically turned to the Bahn Mi and said that was her favorite dish so I went with her advice and got that.  Again is crazy to spend $20 for such a sandwich but at least it looked like it came with a nice fancy side salad and the filling would be with not only tofu but also some  freshly made papaya slaw that at least made it seem more upscale.  I was going to get a guest tap beer they had but they ran out so I decided to get one of their cocktails without the alcohol at those were $15 drinks.

Nice to sit out on the patio and people watch all the shoppers in fancy smancy Montecito while you wait for your drinks and meal.  Got my Green Hornet drink which was probably just the Juice Ranch that is across the street poured into a fancy glass with ice:)  Banh Mi came out and it looked really great.  It was averaged size sandwich that came on a fresh bun that was not your typical crunchy light bread of Viet spots but more like a more denser french roll.  Everything looked very fresh and the side salad looked really fresh too.  Taste wise I did like everything.  The sandwich was cut in two with toothpicks in the center so definitely more upscale presentation.  The salad was very tasty and had some gourmet greens like frisee lettuce, some other micro greens and tomatoes.  I made sure to eat slowly to savor every $3 bite my plate:)  Overall I thought it was very good and if it was like a bit less money I could say it was definitely a 4-5 star sandwich. 

Overall I wanted to check this place out as there are not many upscale vegan restaurants out there that are still living and if I did it over again I would definitely come back during dinner time where there are more offerings and hopefully find something that is creative and upscale in taste worthy of the high price tags they have here.  Overall a solid place to check out if you know you will be paying a premium  and get smaller than average plates of food.  I may up my rating after trying it again at Dinner time with hopefully more people to make for a more lively experience."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We were in Santa Barbara for our babymoon so I was excited there was now a fancy, romantic vegan restaurant in the area. It's a lovely atmosphere with a beautiful dog-friendly patio, though we opted to leave our dog at home and sit inside. You won't feel out of place dressed up or more casually.

We ordered a few small plates to share, and it was the perfect amount of food. They don't fry anything, and it felt like a very healthy meal.

The Kung Pao Cauliflower was wonderful, maybe my favorite dish of the night. My husband wanted the Shishito Peppers, which I don't normally like very much but these were great. We both loved the miso aioli the accompanied it, and I found myself dipping other things in it so I wouldn't have to eat too many shishitos, haha.

The Artichoke ""Crab Cakes"" didn't live up to my favorite ""crab cakes"" made from hearts of palm at Crossroads Kitchen in LA, but they were still very nice and were accompanied by a delicious corn salad. My husband wasn't interested in tasting the crab cakes but he was thrilled with the corn salad. Lastly, we had the Farro Bolognese. The fresh spinach tagliatelle was great but I was not a fan of farro as a meat substitute. It also didn't look very appetizing, with the ""bolognese"" plopped on top. I wish I had tried a flatbread instead of the pasta.

We had enough room for dessert so we shared a chocolate tart. This was great, though the crust tasted a little too ""healthy."" I wondered if it's a raw crust, made with dates and nuts. My husband just left it behind and enjoyed the chocolate filling.

I think it's a little weird that their three ""large plates"" are two burgers and pad Thai, none of which interested either of us for a fancy dinner. The menu is a little all over the place, it's hard to get a feel for what type of cuisine they are. But the food we ordered was mostly very tasty and we had a lovely date."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Favorite. Love their story.  Staff. Food. Drinks. Ambiance.  It's everything! Plant based for life!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I highly recommend this restaurant!!  As a vegan it is hard to find places like these.  Classy and 100% plant based.  The garden style dining with the lights and classy decor made it a perfect setting for my wife and I's silver wedding anniversary.  Now onto the food.  We chose a sparkling wine to complement our meal.  The wine list was extensive.  The first course was the Roman artichoke hearts with dipping sauce.  Amazing flavor!!  Then we moved on to the mushrooms ravioli.  Once again, delicious!!  Both dishes were prepared with good presentation.  We wrapped our meal by sharing a vegan chocolate cake and coffee.   Great service.  Our server Brooke was very attentive and thoughtful.   All the the staff were very friendly.  Glad that I found this gem along the central coast.   We will be back!!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Oh my gosh, Oliver's was fantastic!!!!

 I asked a local vegan Facebook group to recommend where to eat and Oliver's was it! Service was outstanding, ambiance was beautiful, and the food was excellent. We had the Thai Curry and the Italian Sausage Peppadew Flatbread to start. Then we had the Oliver's Burger and also the Banh Mi. Superb!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"One of the best plant-based restaurants I have ever been to. 
We went on Halloween and the place was packed, but we still got a fantastic table service.
The menu has a lot to offer with a big variety of gluten-free options. We definitely want to come back to try more!
We ordered braised mushroom ravioli (my favorite so far), Italian sausage & peppadew flatbread, and Oliver's burger. Everything was delicious, and the texture was not compromised on the gluten-free meals.
As dessert we got a complimentary lime cheesecake for my birthday  that was delicious 

TIP
make sure to have a reservation 

PROS
- gluten-free options
- delicious plant-based food
- a variety of options in the menu
- excellent service 
- a beautiful ambiance perfect for celebrations

CONS
- Parking can be a bit challenging, but maybe this was our experience because of Halloween
- On the pricey side (but worth it in my opinion)"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I love Olivers so much. The Olivers Apple salad is my favorite all time salad. I have also gotten the truffle potatoes, herb roasted sweet potatoes, crab cakes which are all good. The thai curry is spicy but really good. The mushroom tostada is also really good and a little bit spicy.  The pear and gorgonzola flatbread is TO DIE FOR. I am gluten intolerant but I chose to deal with the tummy ache and cheat for this flatbread because it is just so amazing.  I really hope that in the future they create a gluten-free option of dough for the flatbreads.  Overall, all of my dining experiences at Olivers have been great!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,A beautiful restaurant atmosphere. Upscale and elegant. I really enjoyed dining both on the patio and inside. All of the food was great. Highly recommend.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This is my favorite vegan restaurant! I have  
literally drove from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara three times within a year span, in order to eat the amazing food and desserts that Oliver's has to offer. The waiters and waitresses are so attentive and kind. I definitely recommend Oliver's for any special occasion (e.g., Birthday, graduation, anniversary, etc) and for a casual occasion. If you decide to give this place a try go ahead and order the Wild Mushroom Tostada! You will not regret coming to Oliver's."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"1. Shout out to our server Lyle.  
2. Interesting drink menu with fresh juices.
3. Excellent Brussel sprouts and Cauliflower. It seems like they're doing the cauliflower a little bit differently than they used to in the early days. I really like it this new way.
4. I had the burger with lettuce. It was OK. The other burger looks appealing but it's super messy and hard to eat. 
5. I'll give it a four because it's just sometimes trying to be so inventive that you lose potential converts. It would be nice if some of the meal items like pad Thai really were presented more traditional 

I absolutely love cross roads in LA and I wish they had some dishes and options similar to crossroads. I have friends who are not vegetarian but they love crossroads. Yet Oliver's it's not on their list.   Am hopeful it will be as Oliver's expands some of its menu offerings that could fool a meat eater 

6. Thank you for the birthday delicious chocolate"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We took a friend who is vegan to Oliver's when he came to visit. We had been there once before, and had said we'd be back, but hadn't been until our friend came to town. We thoroughly enjoyed it. I was concerned because our friend is SUPER picky, but he loved it, too."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,Very slow service and major attitude from our server. Vegan food was good flatbread was uninspired
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Everything about our experience here was amazing. We just happened to be in the area and searched for a nearby vegan restaurant. The first one that came up was Oliver's and it looked good so we went. There were only spots at the bar open so we did that, which ended up making it an even better because we got to meet Billy. Billy is the bartender who took care of us and he goes above and beyond. He was so nice and personable and made great recommendations. Believe me if you go here request sitting at the bar when Billy is working. He makes amazing cocktails and many of them are his own creations.  He made our less than stellar day into a memorable one. The Manager was also great and made sure we had a great experience. Check this place out if you are in the area. You won't be disappointed."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Ambiance was incredible!!
The mood lighting with outside seating is a perfect setting! They have everything set up to be comfortable while you dine!
The service was wonderful, very attentive with friendly warm servers.
We have been vegan for 2 yrs now and vegetarian for about 12 yrs and the dishes we chose were not great.
They lack the wow factor. We found that vegan dishes need to be enriched with flavor and these were lacking.
The brussel sprouts with pecans and avocado was ok. This dish was comparable to something you can easily prepare at home, nothing special.
Also shared the chickpea  curry.
Now this dish was stellar! So delicious and flavorful with just the right amount of Curry kick. Definitely favorite dish of the night.
We also tasted the Impossible burger with truffle potatoes. Flavor was mostly onions but no wow factor. Truffle potatoes tasted like potatoes and oil. Nothing else, no herbs, no salt or pepper even.  
Oh The Bahn Mi sandwich!
Extremely disappointed in the way the tofu was prepared. Almost felt like it was sliced, fried, and slapped on the bread.
No flavor, tofu was still very wet, maybe not cooked through all the way.
For dessert we had the Apple crumble and it was overwhelmingly sweet.
Maybe it was the choices we made but we were a little disappointed.
Drinks, 1 of 2. ""The Billy Billy"" with mezcal was a bit clashing. The smoky flavor with the bitterness of the cucumber didn't mesh well.
""Mr. Pink"" a very good combo of flavors, very soft at first taste with just the right amount of liquor kick at the back of the tongue.
Overall, a bit pricey for the flavor profile selected but a great place to impress on a 1st date!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"At the last minute Oliver's cancelled our reservation due to a ""rain storm"". I've heard of their great reviews and I'm highly disappointed in their customer service. The manager ""Phyllis"" told us the kitchen closed at 8:30PM 20 minutes before our reservation... Highly disappointed. Take you're chances hunties!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Great staff, welcoming, friendly, all hard working, and helping each other out. Good vibes on the patio with string lights and open air. Delicious VEGAN plates, especially the ravioli and chocolate dessert. I enjoyed my solo birthday dinner :)"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,This was an amazing experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was absolutely wonderful. The seating options were wonderful and the decor was great. The servers were all extremely kind and helpful choosing what to eat. The food was INCREDIBLE. We got multiple share plates and split everything between us. Everything was delicious and the portion sizes were really good. The flavors were wonderful and even our friends who weren't vegan enjoyed.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Found Oliver's through Yelp and it sure did not disappoint!  All plant based menu with a delicious selection of Californian and fusion food.  The restaurant itself is stunning.  Set in a garden with plenty of heaters and beautifully lit trees, it has adapted well to covid times.  The tables are maybe a little too close for some people, but they do require people to wear masks when not seated.  The service was excellent and the food was all delicious.  In fact it was so good I plan to go back before leaving SB!  If you are vegan/vegetarian or want to eat more plant based foods this is a no-brained."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,This place was amazing. Especially Billy. He was the light of my evening and made me an AWESOME drink for me. His personality was the best. The food was really good and the key lime pie was excellent. I will definitely come back again!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,The cutest ambiance. We did to go and the food was absolutely spectacular!! Its been hard to find a good vegan bolognese place but wow i wish i coulda had more!!
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I like their improved menu. I still like to see more items like I see at crossroads kitchen. Their drinks are excellent I just wish they made their own juices Or better understood who they are supporting given where they are sourcing their juices.

Whether you're plant-based for your Health or because of animals or because of civil rights issues, this may be of interest to some customers.  It's nice to eat and support businesses that align with doing good., So Olivers is doing that in many ways except for where they purchase their juice.  

We've been learning a lot about how to walk the talk with the environment, human rights, and well-being. Switch for good has some excellent information on this. We appreciate that Olivers gives us a true vegan all plant-based option and beautiful montecito

Plus - It's usually got a good energy. Pretty lights. Good looking service. And it's wonderful to eat so healthy... Delicious plant-based. Thank you Olivers"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"A really outstanding dining experience. Food was very (very) good, service was outstanding, a very enjoyable bottle of wine certainly helped. Expensive, but worth every penny.

Unless you are a regular I would view Oliver's as a small plate establishment. The two of us ordered 4 plates; the two dishes that were not spicy were served first (Artichoke Cakes, Brussels Sprouts). We were periodically tactfully watched so the spicier dishes (Kung Pao Cauliflower, Shishito  Peppers) could be prepared and served as we were finishing what amounted to a first course. 

We were both extremely happy with the four dishes we ordered, getting unfinished portions boxed so we could enjoy desert with excellent coffee. The Key Lime pie was the perfect finish to a perfect meal.

In addition to the small plates the menu includes flatbreads and sandwiches. If I lived in the area and ate frequently at Oliver's the options would be appreciated. As a visitor, as mentioned previously, I would recommend the small plates.  As others have mentioned, the outdoor dining area (where we ate) is well situated, overlooking the shopping area across the street and the menu is fully vegan.

Adding to the enjoyment, we walked to the restaurant from downtown Santa Barbara, about a 1 hour walk largely along the beach and a Bird Refuge, taking an Uber back.

Definitely would return on a future visit to Santa Barbara."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"OMG!!! This place blew me out of the water! I all but gave up on any restaurant in the Santa Barbara area being anything but pedestrian for a number of years. 

This evening we went to Oliver's which had originally been planned and canceled in 2018 as a result of the mudslide. I could kick myself because we didn't reschedule sooner!!!

The food was exquisite. Each dish was done to perfection, with the right amount of flavors exploding in my mouth and me trying to decipher the complex ingredients.

The three dishes we ordered were wonderful, but my favorite by far was the ARTICHOKE ""CRAB CAKES"" - HEARTS OF PALM, CORN, SCALLIONS, CHERRY TOMATO, ARUGULA, SPICY AIOLI. (GF)

KUNG PAO CAULIFLOWER - CASHEWS, JAPANESE CHILI. (GF)

BRUSSELS SPROUTS - AVOCADO, PECANS, WHITE BALSAMIC. (GF)
Were also quite good. 

A shout out to Randy for wonderful service, and taking such good care of us, We look forward to returning before long because this place is absolutely spectacular!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Amazing!!! Billy was my server/bar tender and was just an amazing guy. He had amazing recommendations like the artichoke heart witch is now one of my favorite things I have ever had!! Good people great atmosphere I will be back soon!

iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Saw this vegan / GF restaurant that just opened in Montecito across from my boy Ritchie's Barber.  The restaurant was a 4-year renovation of the spot formerly known as Peabody's,.  Great indoor / outdoor seating and full bar.  Phil -- the 25 year old ""owl wise"" assistant manager -- is a really special person and the owner should know that this guy is worth his weight in gold.  

Server was red-haired and tall,  He gave some great recommendations.  The menu is amazing is is completely vegan with GF selections.  The ""Impossible Burger"", Farro Risotto, Artichoke Crab Cakes, Shishito Peppers, Kung Pao Broccolini, Mushroom Tostado -- wonderful  plant-based creations.  Portions are substantial, which is refreshing with this level of cooking / cuisine.

Bar offered Vueve Clicot by the glass, and also fresh squeezed grapefruit, so Tito's and Grey Goose were added.  Service was excellent and food came out at a great pace.  

My Mushroom Tostado was made with homemade masa griddled up with a layer of avocado and lots of delicious mushrooms that doubled for meat.  It was finished with radish sprouts, cabbage and radishes.  The Impossible Burger is made from an ingredient called heme, which the Impossible people say is ""the basic building block of life on Earth, including plants, but is uniquely abundant in animal muscles' meat."" My dad who hates meat taste actually enjoyed this burger.

Looking forward to more visits to Oliver's -- the decor, setting, staff and menu all hit high marks.  Thanks again to Phil for making it so rad !!!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Descent! Cute spot and good service. Pad Thai wasn't that great but I loved my pear pizza style thing, I forget what it was called haha. My husband didn't care for his sausage pizza style thing. Over all I would go back but keep trying different items until I find my favorites! So I liked it over all and nice staff."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"I am not a vegan, but this restaurant is really great. The Thai noodle dish is my favorite. Their hummus platter is truly amazing. I think they do an excellent presentation and food quality is amazing."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,This was an amazing experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was absolutely wonderful. The seating options were wonderful and the decor was great. The servers were all extremely kind and helpful choosing what to eat. The food was INCREDIBLE. We got multiple share plates and split everything between us. Everything was delicious and the portion sizes were really good. The flavors were wonderful and even our friends who weren't vegan enjoyed.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Celebrated our 1 year vegan anniversary at Oliver's.  First time here and first time to Santa Barbara.   Oliver's is so nice and it was so exciting to find a vegan restaurant that is also up scale.   ""Crab"" cakes were fantastic as was my polenta entree.   Service was also fantastic.   Great experience. 

My only note to the bar staff and management would be to NEVER muddle an Old Fashioned.  It's incorrect and made for a subpar cocktail  

Everything else was perfect"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Every now and then, I like to treat myself to a fancy place. Oliver's gets bonus points for being a fancy vegan place!

We started with Artichoke ""Crab"" Cakes. Wow! The tasty blend of artichoke, hearts of palm, and corn totally hit the spot. I especially loved the spicy aioli. http://bit.ly/2uoLoTm

The Cauliflower Bucatini was amazing! The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente, the cauliflower cream hit all the right savory notes, and there were all kinds of green veggies mixed there. Nice pops of color using green, orange, and purple cauliflower too! Although you couldn't tell from my photo, the serving size was perfect since it filled me up while also leaving the right amount of room for dessert. http://bit.ly/2G9IVl8

The Meateater BF ordered the Lotus Bowl but it didn't really do it for me. Not that it wasn't good. It's just that I wasn't craving Asian flavors. http://bit.ly/2GxB5RJ

For dessert, I had the Chocolate Tart. I had every intention to take a few bites then wrap it up to go. Yeah, that didn't happen. I ate the whole thing. That's right, I said I. The BF didn't eat any because he's allergic to cashews. So dessert was all me. No regrets! http://bit.ly/2I6NxF4

This dinner was one of the highlights during our weekend trip to Santa Barbara and I'm absolutely certain I'll be back anytime we're in town!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"For our girls weekend, we decided to check out Oliver's vegan restaurant. It's a quick walk from any of the rooms if you're staying at the Coast Village inn.

The outdoor patio is stunning with the most picturesque lights and gorgeous trees. Even though we were outside, the heaters kept us warm and we felt comfortable the entire time.

Hands down the best part of our meal was our cocktails. The endless summer drink was to die for.

I also highly recommend the pear and arugula flatbread, though we enjoyed everything we ate! 

I don't typically eat a lot of vegan cuisine but we loved this place and we're already planning another visit."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"We absolutely enjoyed this Vegan Restaurant! Excellent food and service. It has a beautiful, relaxed atmosphere. I highly recommend this fine , classy restaurant. Very friendly and professionally trained staff pamper you. Our home away from home.
We will be regulars"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"A+++ ambiance and service! Impressive plant base menu! Half of our order was crazy good but the other half of it lacked flavor. I was super bummed because we were excited to have dinner there all day. Most of their starters or entrees are extremely reasonable in pricing. The only thing that seemed over priced was their Don Julio 1942. I order it often and never paid $45 per shot (on the rocks). We walked away disappointed because the $300 dinner, which included a $50 tip, didn't mirror the reviews on yelp. With that many great yelp reviews, we seriously just caught them on an off night. We would totally give it another chance (minus the Don Julio 1942). I so wanted to give it 5 starts but it was a miss last night."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"The flavors were remarkable. Often, vegan is something less or watered down like a drawing made with a limited color palette. Somehow the food at Oliver's is more complex and exciting than most plant based dining I've experienced.  Don't miss Oliver's even if you don't have a vegan gluten free child."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Incredible upscale vegan restaurant! My husband and I had the artichoke crab cakes, jackfruit tacos, raw lasagna and shishito peppers. All the food was amazing especially the crab cakes. The tacos are super filling and tasty. The raw lasagna is more like a stacked salad of heirloom zucchini and tomato with truffle oil and sauces - it was super refreshing. The shishito peppers are delicious but we got a super spicy batch so we could only finish half :(  We had some of the cocktails without liquor (basically very nice fresh local juices) and the apple crumble for dessert. It's one of the nicest vegan restaurants I've been to outside of Paris! Outdoor seating is just lovely-- the heat lamps keep you nice and warm under their beautiful canopy of trees and lights. Service is friendly and professional. There is complimentary valet parking which is really nice!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Second time trying to buy a gift certificate . Went in and man with ponytail tells us he is busy and can't go to office to get one. Maybe  you should keep those where they are accessible. So lazy, $200 will be spent somewhere else. Really?!"
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"This was the best vegan food we ever ate, and their dog friendly. 

We ordered truffle potato, kung pau cauliflower, Thai noodles, Oliver burger with beyond meat patty which is incredibly delicious."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,negative,"Pros: Nice new place, which took them a very long time to finish. Years, in fact. Very stylish inside. Service was good.

Cons: Seated at 8:30 for 8:00 reservation. Overpriced drinks at the bar. Food? Flavor issues, as in ""lack of."" I had something called the Lotus Bowl, which was basically a large pile of garbanzo beans, a serving of black rice, and some squash. The menu said ""curry chickpeas,"" but I swear there was no curry flavor whatsoever. Small, stingy dish of tahini was, I suppose, there to give it some taste, but the dish would have had to have been considerably larger for that to have happened. 

Highlight: As an appetizer, the artichoke ""crab cakes"" were good. Also, we ordered the shishito peppers and the long beans as side dishes, but they never arrived, and not a word was spoken about them again (and they did not appear on the bill, so no harm done).

Not going back."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,Love! I came here not so long after it had opened and I was left super impressed! Great bar/wine list and innovative but simple and delicious cuisine. I felt so great after leaving because the experience was simply divine and the food was healthy but in an elevated way. Can't wait to come back.
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Vegan's heaven, very well seasoned :) we had an awesome Valentine's Day dinner at Oliver's - shared 7 dishes (small and large), enjoyed every bite! Seating was tight (tables so close!) but this situation is to be expected at a popular restaurant on Valentine's. Service was smooth. 5 stars."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"Okay, so let me clarify that I rarely write reviews.    Having said that, either I hated or loved this place.   The food was amazing and the service, geese, it was to good to be true.  The host ( a young white man with blonde hair in a pony tail) was as sweet as they come.  The waiter was phenomenal as well (due to this darn masks wear, I was only able to see his eyes but he looked like Jack  Ryan lol).  Thank you for such a pleasant experience.  My 10 year anniversary was a success.   Hubby loved the place and we will be back.  Omg yummy food."
iHdrLu8deF5GceB0V1rPhA,Oliver's,American,positive,"My husband and I started off and ended our honeymoon in Montecito. Since he is a strict Vegan, I had to do some research on restaurants that had a good choice of Vegan dishes. *Oliver's has entered the chat* First, I was surprised to see an *all Vegan* restaurant. The reviews and the menu looked good, so we made a reservation. Let me tell you how good this food is! Everything we ate was delicious! The staff was very welcoming and answered all the questions we had about what was in the dishes. Our waitress, Heather, was awesome (we even made sure we sat in her section when we came back a week later). Also, the restaurant itself is SO CUTE! Patio seating amongst trees, hanging lights everywhere, and lots of heat lamps. The music was great too. We loved it so much, we made a reservation for the following week before we left. The menu items we had amongst both visits: Brussel sprouts, Thai curry, Pad Thai, Braised mushroom ravioli, the Veggie burger, and the chocolate fudge cake for dessert. Oliver's is one of our absolute favorite places now. We just wish they had a location in OC."

My friend and I shared the Mexican corn, the steak bites, the ranch burger, and the prosciutto flatbread. Everything was beyond expectations. Even the butter that came with the hot crispy bread was insane. I have definitely found a new place to come back to every time I visit Santa Barbara‼"

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Excellent food, and excellent service. The drinks are awesome too. I got the Parmesan cauliflower, filet mignon steak bites, and the burger with Parmesan fries. The Barney shrubble drink is delicious, I had two . The atmosphere is very nice, good for a date night or girls night out ( what I did ) and Trevor is the best server! I would go back for sure."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"My husband and I went in for an early dinner and I'm so glad we did. I'm pretty picky when it comes to certain salads and when they didn't have anything I liked I was bummed but my husband ordered the house salad and it was delicious! Butter lettuce, peaches, pistachios and a light vinaigrette. One of the best salads I've ever had. We both ordered burgers and they were some of the best burgers ever. The meat was cooked to perfection, fresh ingredients and the pickle was awesome. The fries were really good and the service was great too. If we visit SB again were def coming back!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"This is my favorite place in Santa Barbara. I've been living here for almost two years now and I've experienced nothing better than Intermezzo! I love the cozy yet upbeat atmosphere. This is great place to grab a drink, kick back and eat some AMAZING food. I am especially a fan of their prosciutto and humboldt fog pizza, it is insane! The apps, wine list and service is all exceptional. I am always sad to leave this place!"

This is a comfortable place that is accommodating to a wide audience, and always has great service.  I agree with other reviews complimenting Trevor - he's the best bartender in town!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend and was mildly unimpressed.

Service - we walked in and stood unattended to for at least 5 minutes while hostesses/waitresses passed by without a word.  When we finally got seated, we were asked different times by different people whether we had gotten menus, drinks, etc.  I don't think there was enough communication between the servers about who was supposed to be attending our table.

Food - the small plates/appetizers were pretty interesting.  We got ratatouille, which was not the way I pictured it on the Disney movie, but was delicious nevertheless: grilled vegetables seasoned with oil and pepper.  Boyfriend got the Thai chicken pizza which he liked and a beer.  I got the bone marrow, which I enjoyed but was a little on the oily side.

All in all, mediocre service and decent food that was sadly overpriced.  Not sure if I'll be returning."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Intermezzo, the Wine Cask's little sister is, as always, amazing. So why you ask, only 4 stars? Because of the sulphur tasting water they serve.  I know water quality has degraded due to changing sources (no more Cachuma water for SB) but why not add a reverse osmosis with a carbon filter like most people have in their homes?  PLEASE!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"The food here is delicious.  There has never been any complaint.  Their burgers are beautifully made with fresh ingredients, the BBQ is wonderful.  The steak bites are fun to share at your table.  The flatbreads are perfect small meals or appetizers to share.  The waiters know how to match the food with wine they offer.  It is a relaxed atmosphere and good place to be with a couple of friends or grab something by yourself.  Their ABC 09 pinot is delicious. I always look forward to enjoying another great meal here!"

We chilled on the couches and ordered the coconut milk mussels, Italian meatballs, calamari, truffle fries and three desserts - the awesome apple tart, the standard warm choc chip cookie and the original pnut butter n jelly lava cake. 

Everything was superb. Not surprising as the owners also own Bouchon. 

Service was top notch."

I love local wines, and was happy to wander in here and order some wine. All of their wines are ""on tap"" in a sense, and so they are fresh and straight from the winery.

The bartender was nice and helpful, and poured me extra tastes when I expressed interest in the Pinor Noirs. We ended up having an in depth discussion of the pinots from 09 and 10 and it was very enjoyable.

Ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and they were quite tasty as a snack with my wine. My friend ordered a Moscow Mule (they have a full bar) and really enjoyed it as well. 

Nice place to relax, drink some wine, and have some food!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"I wish we had more time to actually dine here - we just stopped by for a glass of wine, and loved the ambiance, service and food menu! Definitely on our booklist for next visit!"

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Intermezzo is a little-known jewel of a restaurant behind the Wine Cask that stays open very late. (Apparently they are part of the bigger restaurant.) The potato gnocchi is melt-in-your-mouth perfect. This place is set up with tables on the perimeter and a huge couch and chairs in front of a fireplace in the center, and you can eat there or at the tables. Both the tables and the comfy chairs by the fireplace are great- I've had meals at both. If you get a chance to visit SB try to find this place. You'll be glad you did! French food (buttery, rich), relaxed atmosphere, good times!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"I only gave it 3 stars because the service was so bad this particular night. 

We came here 11/14/14 before a show and it was packed. Our waiter only gave us one menu, it took over 10 minutes to get our drinks, and our waiter ignored us the entire evening. We had to flag him down to speak to him for our order or a refill and then he literally would run off. We were never checked on or would he stay long enough in one spot where I even was able to finish my order- he just left so quickly. I understand they were apparently understaffed perhaps and since they don't take reservations they don't know how busy they will be but it made the experience so much less then what it could have been. 

The Drinks are awesome, best cocktails in town. The food was very good but portion sizes were tiny. For example, we ordered an artichoke among others things and they only give you 1/2 of one so the appetizers weren't really splitable like we were hoping; they were all pretty much one small serving. 

I hope they step up their game and get this place back to 5 stars!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"We went for cocktails tonight and they were all so delicious!  The food was also amazing.  I had the cauliflower for the appetizer, sea bass for the main dish, and the lemon meringue and all were fantastic."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"Santa Barbara native and a fan of the wine cask and it's chef.  This was not a good night for their baby brother.  We specifically went there because the chicken and waffles were recommended by friends.  No chicken and waffles instead they had chicken and fries, Ehh I'll live... So I didn't want a burger or pizza/flatbread so I ordered the $11 Caesar Salad.  It was a small salad served on a smaller plate.  There was a long sliver of sardine that required cutting but every time you touch the salad lettuce falls off the tiny plate.  It came with rock hard unedible bread.  I was hungry, the waitress wasn't around so I just made the best of it.  After the meal the waitress asked about the salad I don't think she expected the truth if it was bad, she asked as a formality.  I told her it wasn't enjoyable.  She looked at me with a smirk and said, you ate it.  I think she thought I was trying to have it removed from my bill, which I wasn't.  I was simply informing her since she asked.  What can I say?  I'm a pig and I was hungry.  I would have ate my wallet if I had ketchup.  I paid, left a nice tip and we bounced.  My son enjoyed his $15 burger so that was good I guess.  Walked out $40 for burger and dinner salad.  Waaaay too many better places in Santa Barbara to eat to even consider going back."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! Would recommend it to anyone.

Went to Intermezzo for a early dinner before a show at the Santa Barbara bowl. 

Seated us promptly. Great Service. Great atmosphere. Great selection of wine and beer. Didn't get a cocktail but saw them floating around the room, and they sure looked good. 

Cobb Salad Spears. -Tasted good. Not the Highlight of the night. 

Buffalo Tar Tar- Excellent. I haven't had many dishes lately that have blown my mind. This one did. Tasted so good with the amount of citrus, and the quail egg on top. Could have been tuna for how tender the meat was.

Muscles. - Excellent. Took me back to France. The wood oven toast was a great touch. 

Mushroom Flat bread Pizza. Excellent. Simple mushroom pizza with arugula on top. So simple and so good!

Chicken and Waffles. - Good. Chicken was fried good. Waffles were good. Didn't come together for me as a dish. Seems more like a gimmick. 

All and all a amazing meal. Best in Santa Barbara so far."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"I almost don't want to write a review on the awesomeness that is Intermezzo.  It kind of feels like my little secret spot in town and i don't want the buzzards to start swarming!   That would be awfully selfish of me though so here is my proclamation:  I love this place!

It's small, cozy, relaxing, clean, has nice, sexy ambiance, great service, and has reasonable prices.  It's the perfect no-fuss date spot.  You really can't go too wrong with anything you order.  Drinks are great, apps are great, burgers are BOMB - big biiig bada juicy boom bomb, desserts are great.  

I know I'm being completely nondescript but seriously, everything is great!  Everything is fresh.  Everything is delicious."

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Yummy. Perfect service. Beautiful decor and location.  I devoured the salad Nicoise, the fried chicken tenders that if drowned in hot sauce and the artichokes with arugula.  I recommend this bar in lieu of making a formal dinner reservation. Great mistake we made. Do it!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"Food: Very good. Wine: Very very good. Service: Started excellent, ended horribly. Thus the 3 stars. This was a 5-star opportunity that went bad.

My bestie and I went here for apps and wine on a Friday night. We shared the cauliflower (YUM, but small portion), I had the artichoke pesto flatbread and she the skirt steak bites. The flatbread was good, but the crust/bread was not as flat as I would have expected and I felt overpowered the meatiness of the artichokes. The steak came with a small side of greens on same plate, which my friend wished she would have been told because she ordered a green salad too. 

Trevor, who usually works in the neighboring, and related, Wine Cask, hosted us and served us for the first half of our evening. He normally works at the WC but they were closed for a private event, so he was hanging out next door at Intermezzo. (By the way, the WC looked charming, sorry we missed it.) We sat in the bar area at a high top. Meanwhile, the waiter who seemed to be the usual server, we'll call him ""S"", was also helping us alongside Trevor. Friend ordered a martini, I a glass of red. Trevor offered wine that wasn't on their list - twice - based on what I was looking for. My friend's second drink was the second wine he presented after I finished my first glass.
Exit Trevor. Assume he left, or maybe had to go help close the special event next door. Doesn't matter; he left us happy and taken care of.
Enter full-time service from S for the remainder of our evening. Or, better said, mediocre service from S. My water glass went empty for the last third of the meal. He delivered our bill without asking how we were doing, did we want another drink? Or perhaps dessert? We were, incidentally, there celebrating my birthday. The bill arrived probably around 9:30-9:35. We ignored it because we were talking. Friend eventually asked S about desserts (despite bill arriving earlier), since again we were not offered any after finishing our meal. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GOOD. The server reacted as if he was surprised. He pulled his phone out of his pocket to look at the time (9:45). First mistake. Then he said a bit apprehensively that it looked like we still had time - because you know, the kitchen closes at 10:00. Second mistake. WTF? My friend and I were appalled at how rude and short sighted he was in, well, his service. He had the opportunity to save himself from his lacking service for the second half of our meal, and instead he jumped off the cliff. We declined dessert, paid the bill and left. 

I regret that our experience has left a bad taste in both my friend's and my mouths. If I were to return, I would specifically request NOT to be served by waiter S."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"Great food and wine.   Love the flat breads, burgers and sweet potato fries.   Great atmosphere and fun place to eat and drink.    Your experience will depend on who serves you.   Sometimes the service is great and other times they seem very confused, understaffed and apathetic.     Our last experience was over 20 minutes without any attempt to take our order, so we walked out.    The other ten times we've been here it's been great."

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Searching for a glass of (real) champagne and or wine and something lite to eat we choose Intermezzo and it was exactly that and more. We sat at the bar and Trevor was our server while he also tended bar with talent and skill.
The ambiance was soothing with the music selection tastefully done (another talent by Trevor I was told) and not too loud or soft. 
We choose a bottle of Roerder (spelling?) which was fantastic. That was followed by a glass of wine each. Small selection of wine by the glass but it covers a wide range of pallets. I know because I didn't know what I was in need of so Trevor had me taste several wines till I settled on a Rosso and was excellent!
The bar food was in nice small sizes served fresh and hot and promptly. We had the Caesar salad then a pepperoni flat bread, then the steak bites with the awesome truffle Parmesan fries! Oh what a night we had! 
This will be one of me regular spots now when we return to SB. I'm sure Huell Houser would have done an episode on this place if he were still alive for not only what I've mentioned but also the entire staff is pleasing, accommodating, and knowledgeable. The som for instance went out of his way to inform us of fine local wines to try, whether or not they offered them. 
Thank you staff of cafe Intermezzo"

They really accommodated us, printed up custom menus with couples' names, which was a super nice touch.  We  had ""family style"" apps, and the food, ordered off the menu, came out quickly.  They were also able to provide a wedding cake that we were all so happy with.  House wines and ability to order cocktails really added to the event.  Had scoped this place out about a month ago with friends, and made everyone order something different so we could get a good overview of the food.  The preview was great, food and cocktails really hit the mark; and yesterday's event was even better.  Shout out to the server (who we had both times)!  Didn't get your name, but wish you nothing but the best with the coming birth of the baby! Thank you to the whole staff!  P.S. Sat on the patio, which was awesome! fountain and all - and thank goodness for good weather (although we did have a backup plan!)"

We knew we were in for a weekend of wine so we decided on local beers by fig mtn and Telegraph. For lunch, we shared the heirloom salad and Riviera burger. 

The heirloom salad was a treat for any tomato lover with the tomato done three ways. The consomme was served in a little shot glass to sip on in between bites.The riviera burger was made with wagyu beef and I was so delighted when I saw that it was actually medium rare! 

The bartender was great and knew his stuff. He steered us in the way of a few wine tasting bars next door!"

Cute date place, uncrowded, but intimate. A must try! Love the appetizers, the lilac creme brulee and their specialty cocktails are fun, and not super sweet.

First, I have to say this is the BEST burger in SB hands down. Just tried the Italian burger last night, and it was incredible.

We will be back soon!!"

Intermezzo offers a fun and hip vibe that isn't touristy.  The service is great, the drinks are strong and the food is fantastic.

A few favorites are the calamari, crispy cauliflower and mushroom aranchini balls.  Everything I've had there has been fabulous!"

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Intermezzo seemed like a great place to grab a bite before a concert at the Lobero. Us four ladies, stopped in about 7pm and it was packed. Although there were seats outside the night was a bit chilly and we preferred to wait for a table to open up. Luckily as we were waiting a manager? owner? came by and said that they had the large communal table open on the Wine Cask side of the building and that we were welcome to sit there and order off the bar menu. Done! 

We were really happy with the suggestion as that area was much quieter than Intermezzo and we could have a nice conversation. We decided to order lots of small things and share. We were not disappointed. Everything was fresh, tasty, and our waiter was cognizant that we were trying to get to the show. My only regret is that we didn't have time or room for dessert and the dessert menu looked INCREDIBLE. Next time."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"I love Mezzo, and especially more now since they have a Vegan Burger!! I work in El Paseo and I eat there pretty frequently... the service and food are extremely consistent. 10/10!"

The food is grand, the SB County wines are spectacular and the man behind the bar/curtain while I occupied the stool (Jeremy) not only educated me, but made perfect suggestions with the wine on tap, as well as their vast selection of bottled wine. We're here for six weeks, staying less than 1/2 mile away #DangerDanger911Help!.  I have a feeling Jeremy may get sick of seeing me in the same wardrobe over and over (and over) again. Should have brought more than two button downs and a pair of ratty jeans. Yee Olde Navy sale here I come!"

It had a charming, cozy neighborhood feel and friendly staff. I started with a very well made Cosmo. My boyfriend asked about the wines; they were happy to make recommendations and bring tastes to our table until he found what he was looking for. We had the tomato soup, roasted cauliflower and the Nicoisé salad. I would recommend any and all of these dishes, but the best was saved for last. The bread budding with caramel sauce was fabulous.  Imtermezzo will be a place to visit the next trip we make to Santa Barbara."

Joe was our waiter. Great energy, very funny. I have 2 words...cucumber martini! Soooooo good it was hard to drink slowly. The Mac & cheese was fabulous and decadent, the fries were good and so was the ceviche. The ambiance was fantastic. I would recommend this for sure and we will be back next trip!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"I had no intention of dining at Intermezzo. I am so glad my girlfriend and I wondered into Intermezzo late Saturday night. 

We had originally planned to have dinner at Wine Cask. Anyone who has spent time around Wine Cask/Intermezzo can confirm that determining where one location ends and another begins is a bit of a challenge. They have two restaurants, a tasting room (where a private birthday party was being held), and a courtyard (where a wedding reception was taking place). Based on the quality of Intermezzo, I don't think it matters all that much where you end up. 

I tried to find a single complaint about this place. I don't like to not be able to find one thing about a restaurant that I wouldn't improve upon. Intermezzo has broken my rule. My girlfriend and I split a half-carafe of Viognier, calamari, french fries, and the chevre doughnuts. Jesus. Christ.

Everything could have been the superstar of a complete meal at any other restaurant. The wine was affordable and tasted great (I love when restaurants offer options between glasses and bottles). The calamari was perfectly cooked and unique--it is served up with sauteed peppers, jalapenos, and garlic. Should I ever cook calamari in my own home, I will try my damnedest to copy the Intermezzo formula. French fries were perfectly cooked and worked perfectly with the calamari (what can I say--I like my fried food). And, I don't know if there are enough words in the English language to describe how awesome the chevre doughnuts are. It isn't often you have a desert you've never had before that leaves you wishing you could have the exact same dessert the next day. Well, I want to have those doughnuts today, tomorrow, the next day, and the next. They were packed full of flavor, were prepared to have a perfectly crisp texture with a gooey center, and were paired with an decadent coffee ice cream. 

No complaints whatsoever. Just go eat here already."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"This place has a great atmosphere! Located in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara, this bar and cafe offers a great menu and drink selection. We enjoyed a table inside with a good jazz music playing in the background. The service is very friendly and they have a good knowledge of wine since they are right next door to the Wine Cask fine dine restaurant and Margerum Winery. The also have a great outside sitting. 
I highly recommend this place for a happy hour with friends or a romantic date night."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"Ambience was great. Service was excellent. But the food was just okay. I would have given it 5 stars because they had it all, except the awesome food. After all, that's what we were there for, the food first and foremost"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"We went to Intermezzo on a Saturday night and quickly found a seat.  I thought it was odd that a place that was so obviously packed had self-seating, but it worked out.  The interior is not too small, but small enough to be intimate.  The fireplace was lit, the lights were dimmed, and 90s pop/RnB was playing.  Solid.

The husband and I ordered the sweet potato fries, grilled veggies, and a salad.  I originally tried to order some soup, but it had dairy in it; and when I told the waitress I had a dairy allergy and didn't know what I could eat, she just blankly stared at me.  What?  Anyway, the fries were sizable, the salad was small but tasty, and the grilled vegetables were ok--nothing to write home about.  I was just happy to have some roughage after a greasy lunch earlier in the day.

I really, really wanted to like this place.  It's cute, and it can be a romantic spot; but it was just so noisy, everyone is seated less than an arm's length from each other (I literally had one guy's rear inches from my face while he figured out where he would sit at his table), and the food is expensive without being amazing.  The good thing is that it's located in downtown Santa Barbara, and there are tons of other spots to choose from."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"My wife and I stopped in here to have a nice dinner. When we arrived, we were seated quickly, and quickly the waiter came over to get things started.

A really interesting thing they do is wine on tap. I laughed when I saw it on the menu, thinking it was a joke, but they actually have the wine on a tap. I found this unique, and the wine itself was quite good.

Overall I absolutely recommend this place. It can get pricey if you aren't careful, but hey, the food is definitely worth it."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Intermezzo is the type of place that just makes you feel like you're winning at life. The rich, dark toned interior and polished bar creates a refined atmosphere, while the creative chalkboard menus, stone serving platters, and bistro seating keep things from feeling forced. The charcuteries and wine are the type of fare you live in California wine country for. The menu is - in a word - delightful. Raw selections? Check. Farm-to-table cheese? Check. Local vintages on tap in house? Check. The ambiance is convivial and classy, making the experience a 10 from start to finish."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Nice place, had dinner at the restaurant (crispy calamari, beef tartare, Greek flatbread & prosciutto flatbread). Had a few glasses of cab, they have wines on tap and it is best to sit next to the fireplace! I had a great evening with the right person, great food and wine. Good service, nice warm feeling, low lights and reasonable pricing! Will visit for sure next time I am in town! :)"

Tried a couple of flatbreads, steak bites,  truffle fries,  and a warm cockles chip cookie dessert. The only thing I thought had any flavor was the polenta. Great concept but only average execution."

2 stars for food 

The servers were kind and accommodating of the mistakes made during our dining experience. 

The food was boring, not worth the energy, money or calories. 

The wine was good. 

Chicken was severely over cooked, the flavor was good - but it so over cooked it was like chewing a tire.

I don't even know what to say about the tuna tar tar except I gagged."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"I went to Intermezzo to celebrate a friend's birthday and she couldn't have picked a better place.  Everything at Intermezzo was delicious! It's a great place to meet for drinks or celebrate a special occasion with a small group of friends.  

We had the shrimp and bacon hot dog,  the prosciutto and arugula flatbread, the Thai chicken flatbread, the taco truck flatbread, and the meatballs to share.  We also shared a Bread Pudding and Butterscotch Pudding for dessert.  It was all very delicious! Very delicious! I had the Barney Shrubble cocktail and it was SO GOOD! I wanted to tell the waiter to keep them coming! I also tried the Cucumber Martini which was also very refreshing.   Their menu is on their website so you can see their other selections.

I would say that their prices are reasonable -others may call them SB pricey but for the ambience and the quality of the food, the service, and the mouthwatering food and drinks, it's really a great price.

I'll definitely be back!"

We love the cauliflower, the sliders, the calamari, and flat bread...basically everything. Plus it's within walking distance of State Street for a lovely after-date stroll."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Intermezzo is a *wonderful* little spot located in downtown Santa Barbara, about a block down from State Street right across from the Post Office.

I've been dying to give this place a try since I read Kry K's great Yelp about it.  When the wife and I made plans to have a mini-vacation a week or so ago in SB, this spot was on our list of must-try's.  Let me start by saying this:  I completely agree with Kry K in that I almost didn't want to post a review because I kinda don't want it to get so popular that it gets crowded; but still, singing its praises is the right thing to do.

They have both indoor and outdoor seating as well as a full bar inside, along with an attached wine tasting room next door.  Seating both in and out is comfy.  We took our dinner outside to enjoy the balmy SB   The wife ordered a dinner sized chicken club sandwich and I ordered their Cask Burger with Swiss instead of cheddar along with a salad.  Our dining companion, a fellow Yelper from the SB area, ordered a dinner salad with a cerviche-like ahi poke appetizer..  We paired our meals with glasses of local wine.

Our meals were wonderful!  Wifey and companion loved their food and I simply adored my burger.  Thick, juicy, perfectly cooked and seasoned on a soft bun.  Eat bite was a ticket on the Yumtrain to Yumville!!  The salads were great too.  A lovely mix of greens with a light balsamic dressing.  Wife and I actually devoured it all as opposed to just grazing.

The service was great.  Our server, Tyler, was polite, attentive and very helpful in his suggestions.  He helped make our experience that much more enjoyable.

When our dinner ended, our dining companion parted from our company and wifey and I decided to go inside to enjoy a drink and some dessert.  Within we found an inviting dining space.  It's intimate without being crowded; with room to socialize and enjoy the lovely ambiance.  There's even a fireplace to add to the place's.  

We sat at the rather spacious bar and wifey had a Lemon Drop while we both shared a chocolate lava cookie.  Both were incredible!

As far as prices go; I thought it was quite reasonable.  Yes, it's a little pricey but not by SB standards by any means and what's important is you get the quality you pay for.  It's no more expensive than a nice night out anywhere else.  Their menu isn't extensive but their selection of salads, burgers, flatbreads and unique creations make dining here a fun experience that we look forward to experiencing each time we're in town.  As a side note...just being a block down from State Street really makes a difference to the ""vibe"" of the area; close enough to be in the middle of it all but detached enough to be away from the main hustle and bustle of downtown.

Needless to say...the wife and I have found a new favorite spot to chill at in the ""US Riviera""."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"The burgers are the best in town and you can split the free side so if you're in the mood for sweet potato fries AND salad, no problem. All that for only $14 in a chic setting with comfortable seating by the fire. Noise level is low so this is a great place to go with a friend and solve the world's problems without feeling rushed. Or if you're on your own, you'll find the friendly bartender and interesting regulars at the bar good company. They offer a selection of good local beers on tap, including my favorite, Pure Order IPA. The flatbread is not bad but I'm addicted to the burgers so why mess with perfection."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Stopped in after doing some local wine tasting, the atmosphere was lively and fun.  Our server Trevor was very friendly with a beaming smile.  The bartender was making some amazing looking cocktails, although with such a great selection of local gourmet beers and wines we stuck with those.  The burger was just what you want in a burger, nice thick patty with all the extras and the truffle fries were the perfect pair.  Service was excellent throughout our meal and even went above and beyond when, the next day, we realized that we had left our sunglasses.  As we were just visiting, they took the time to mail us back our sunglasses since we were not able to come back.  That is top notch service and its places like this that make you wish more businesses would follow their lead!! Can't wait to visit again!!"

I've been twice now including yesterday (Valentine's Day)...when we were late for our reservations to the Wine Cask, Intermezzo had a spot for us!  It's small and is first come, first served...no reservations. The tapas style menu (except for the burgers) is perfect since it is how we prefer to eat. 

We've had the....
Fries...thin and crispy!
Charcuterie and Three Cheese Plate (the BEST)
Crispy (roasted) Cauliflower...OMG
Flatbread...YES
Crab Cakes...Mmmm
Shrimp Ceviche...actually, the weak link to our meal

My friends ordered wine and loved it.  The food was amazing.  We ordered the cauliflower, brussel sprouts, Mac and cheese (so tasty but could've been warmer), 2 flatbreads, a burger and a few more I can't remember, and all were wonderful.  Not too salty and yet so flavorful (especially the burger!!!).  My only complaint was that there was only 1 person working at the time we came in.  She was great but she had to be hostess/waitress/bartender/server so we didn't get to order food for awhile.  Luckily the food came out fast but my only wish was we could've ordered faster so we could eat the yummy food sooner!  Will definitely be coming back for food and drinks here!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,Awesome place. The food is fantastic. Upscale but not too obnoxious. The price points are great. Their martinis hit the spot.

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Burgers here put Habit to shame. Not a lot else to say - but I will add that Yelp reviews favor Habit by a large margin and I respect the loyalty to Habit's origin. However, going anywhere else for a ""5-star burger"" is a crime against humanity.

Great cocktails. Fantastic burgers. Flat breads will blow your...mind. (Keeping it PG). 

*Will say that the tuna tartare is a bit underwhelming for the price but don't have a lot of other experience with their appetizers.

Enjoy!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"This was a surprise find on a trip to Santa Barbara.  Adjoining the Wine Cask is this somewhat secluded narrow bar with an interesting / fun menu.  We came in here for dinner during Old Spanish Days.  Despite the huge crowds in the restaurants directly off the street, this had a moderate crowd and was quiet and relaxing.  

Staff was very attentive and friendly.  My wife started with a dark and stormy and I had a glass of Qupe grenache.  Generous pour on the wine (always a good start!)  The wines by the glass are local with a nice selection.

Many very interesting looking dishes to the point it was difficult to decide.  We ordered a macaroni and cheese with spanish chorizo and Luau Roasted Pork flatbread (mango-pineapple bbq sauce, red onion, goat cheese, cilantro).  Both were very good.  I would definitely reutrn."

We were travelling home from LA and we enjoy stopping in Santa Barbara on our trips to SoCal. We had brought our dog with us  so we were looking for a pet friendly restaurant and the Intermezzo was perfect. Our server, Caroline immediately took a liking to our dog, Finn, and she showed us to the covered portico in front of the restaurant and made us comfortable as the restaurant was not quite open. We had time to check out their menu and make our selections and Caroline got our drinks order up and Finn a little bowl of treats and some water. Our drinks came, Tablas Creek Patelin for my wife and a pleasant golden ale for myself. We had a couple of plates to share: the burrata and avocado toast and the bone marrow both of which were excellent and for our entrees, my wife had the artichoke pesto flat bread and I had the Riviera burger which was quite large and cooked perfectly. My wife loved the flat bread and liked the usage of pine nuts and that the bread was very thin. We really enjoyed our visit to the Intermezzo and recommend it to anyone wanting a pleasant, chill place to enjoy grear food and drink that's pet friendly with excellent service."

The restaurant is small and cozy with a HUGE wood burning fireplace that I loved and ample bar seating. The whole place is first come first serve so don't come starving. 
The food was very hit or miss. The artichoke hearts won the night - perfectly grilled with a delicious sauce on top. The truffle parmesan fries and ratatouille were also pretty good.
The meatballs and Market flatbread were not. The meatballs were in a delicious sauce but were very overcooked and dry. The flatbread was soggy and very lacking in flavor. 
I would come back for a glass of wine and to enjoy the atmosphere (that roaring fireplace!), but I think I'll skip the food next time."

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"I celebrated one of my bachelorette dinners at Intermezzo and we all had the best time! The menu offers a wonderful variety to choose from (one of my ladies is a vegetarian who enjoyed her meal), and both the wine and cocktails were amazing! My group of 9 ladies shared the charcuterie board and two pizzas as an appetizer (mushroom and sausage) and both were phenomenal. The pizza ingredients were fresh and the charcuterie board had a nice variety. We shared entrees and appetizers so we could try different things (pate, oysters Rockefeller, salmon, and 2 specials-steak and pon frites). Make sure to leave room for one of their decadent desserts! They all looked so good we tried almost of them (mousse, milk shakes and the lemon crème brûlée). Our server did an excellent job taking care of our group of 9, and it was so magical to sit in the courtyard during twilight. We were all so grateful to of had such a fun and tasty night at this beautiful place!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Great spot we had seen but never tried.  Worth it!

Great staff.  Accommodating and good customer service. Russ was our server and he took really good care of us with wine suggestions and good recommendations- ask for him. 

We started with the beet salad and pate as well as the arugula salad. All generous servings with solid ingredients and complexity. The beets had pesto as well as a vinaigrette and watercress but also had goat cheese...nice sweet savoury combo. The pate was-accompanied by the  mustards and jams as well as a pile  of pickles.  Worked well and the salt drew out the flavor.  Washed it down with some Cremant and a Syrah.  

The pizza was the interlude.  It was not quite NY style but was good...  nice b flavors and good cheese. 

The steak was excellent and the frites were just right in crispness and salt.  Delicious marinade.   Tender juicy ny strip.  The Brussels sprouts and asparagus were the perfect accompaniments...   

I highly recommend this place!"

Great wine list at reasonable prices, especially for downtown SB. Liked the long list of half bottles. 

Service was spot on too. 

And we had a cozy spot right next to the fireplace. 

Zero complaints."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"""Intermezzo Bar + Cafe"" should take out the Cafe in their name and just become ""Intermezzo Bar"". Their food is just average and EXTREMELY over priced for the portions.  Don't get me wrong I have no problem spending money on good food but only if it's worth it!  The mussels and the burgers are about the only items on the menu that I've enjoyed without breaking the bank.  The chicken and waffles are super dry and really small for the price.  DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT order the Thai Chicken Salad!  In short the food at Intermezzo Bar + Café is just average and in my mind yo-yoing up and down just not getting the job done.  Now that I'm done with the food I want to give the Bar some amazing compliments.   If you're looking for great unique cocktails, Intermezzo has it.  I personally love their Manhattan!  They also have great local wine and beer selections with top notch, knowledgeable bartenders.  Trevor, our favorite bartender always makes great drinks and makes us feel right at home.   I really want to give Intermezzo 4 stars but I had to bring it down because of the food."

We ordered oysters rockefeller, half dozen oysters, little gem salad, beet salad, special steak, clams and the salmon. Every single dish was enjoyed by all.

The staff is warm, made us feel like old friends and are very responsive. The food tasty, cooked to perfection and the beverages, well, outstanding!

After eating out for almost every meal this last week on a staycation in Santa Barbara and finding almost every other location severely lacking in the service department, intermezzo was a shining star of excellent service and has been the highlight dining experience of our week!!

Our server Paul was very attentive, friendly and had great drink recommendations! The other waitstaff was equally attentive, refills on water, clearing plates, etc. 

Beyond the stellar staff, the food was delicious and filling, we had the meatballs (delicious) and two pizzas which were way more then enough food! So tasty!

I honestly can't recommend this place enough!! We will be back soon!

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"The hidden gem of SB. Seriously. Most tourists think to walk up and down State Street while looking for a dinner spot, but being just one street over nestled in the historic ""Paseo"", Intermezzo has to be the locals' secret spot. Wines on tap, local brews, craft cocktails, and an AMAZING menu. Our server told us, it's the same chef as their parent restaurant ""Wine Cask"", and it all made sense. Each dish was elegant like you'd expect from Wine Cask, but a bit more casual. Also, my girlfriend is vegan, and they had plenty of options for her. Apparently the chef is working on a ton of new vegan items for the ""Vegan Chef Challenge"" in the spring. Highly recommend this spot for a quick drink before the show, or a fun filled dinner with friends."

The pizzas are to die for, had the cup and char and mushroom truffle, followed by the mariniayed skirt steak with chimichurri sauce. To die for! They had more options on the menu but this was absolutely incredible, I highly recommend anyone in Santa Barbara to try this place. Make reservations because they get packed!

We stood there for a few minutes, trying to figure out where to go. An employee came out, asked what we needed, and told us about a very nice place close by that was still open, and that she thought we would really enjoy.  (She was right.)

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"This cafe is very cute and romantic area to spend time with your love one or celebrate a certain occasion. Its quite small outside but there plenty of room in the patio. The service for this cafe is excellent. The server we had was extremely polite and very funny man. He made the evening quite enjoyable. 

There not a big selection of wine but its quite a good selection. They allow you to have a small sampling of the wine they provided before you can order, which is a bonus! We got the Flying Goat Pinot Noir. Its quite light and smooth tasting. I forgot what he gave us to sample but it was amazing! I wish I could remember it but it was red wine with a perfect drying taste. We didn't order any type of big meal but we got the cheese and charcuterie. I love the cheese selection they gave us. I wish there was slightly bigger selection on the charcuterie but it was still good. The only downside I have on the plate was that I wish the bread was softer. The bread they offer is crunchy and hard. 

Overall, this place is amazing with a wonderful view. Would come back if I am visiting Santa Barbara."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Intermezzo used to be my go-to wine bar when I lived in SB a few years back.  My GF and I would stop here for some wine, cheese, and tapas at least a couple of times per month.  The staff were always very friendly and we got to know them pretty well (Justin, one of our favorite servers has since moved on to open Julienne, which is quite a success I understand.  We wish him well!).

Shortly after we moved back to LA, Intermezzo closed and was remodeled.  The decor is a little more dark and upscale than before, but the vibe is essentially the same. And they still have their cozy fireplace (although the couches have been replaced with tables, unfortunately). 

The menu has changed and seems more expansive than I remember.  Some of our old standbys are still there (thankfully they didn't axe their truffle fries), but the chef has added quite a few new interesting options.  The selections seem to be leaning more towards rustic/hearty pub fare than trendy tapas, with offerings like Fried Chicken & Waffles, Grilled Wagyu Flatiron Steak, and Beer-steamed Mussels.  They also have both steak and tuna tartare if you're into that, as well as a nice selection of salads, burgers, flatbreads, pastas, and cheese/charcuterie platters.

In terms of wine, Intermezzo offers six whites and seven reds, all ""on-tap"" and delivered to the restaurant in environmentally friendly tanks rather than bottles.  The wines appear to be kept at cellar temperatures and are sealed from air exposure, so you'll never get a flat pour from yesterday's dregs.  You can order by the glass or half/full carafe.  If you'd prefer something else, you can also order a bottle from the encyclopedic wine list of their five star sister restaurant (Wine Cask) next door.  They have some nice Volnays I used to order, as well as prestige bottles like Lafite / Mouton Rothschild, or Chateau Margaux (though I'd suggest eating at the restaurant if you're going that route).

My GF opted for the Flying Goat Pinot Noir, which was very nice;  I tried the Margerum 'M3' Rhone Blend, which wasn't terribly exciting, so I switched to the Flying Goat for the rest of the evening.  The pours were reasonable; Not overly generous, but not stingy either.  My only complaint were the glasses, which I found too narrow and really more suited to white wines than red.  I prefer a large bowl when I'm drinking reds so I can go all sommelier and get my swirl on.

For our food selections, we ordered their Truffled Parmesan Fries, a cheese platter, the Grilled Market Vegetables, and the Fried Chicken & Waffles Basket.  The truffle fries were rustic and flavorful, and the cheese platter was very generous and served on a cool granite slab.  The market vegetables were abundant and tasty and a big hit with my Vegan GF.   I'm not generally a big fried food fan, but the chicken and waffles just sounded too interesting to pass up.  They were surprisingly awesome and included an apricot marmalade dipping sauce that complimented both perfectly.  Sort of Chicken McNuggets meets Haute Cuisine (I suspect I just made their chef wince).

The dessert menu has quite a few interesting offerings, including Bourbon Bread Pudding, Trio of Doughnuts, and a Cocoa & Caramel Tart.  At our waiters suggestion, we opted for the Warm Chocolate Chip Cookie Pie, which unfortunately I didn't find all that exciting.  I'll try the tart or the doughnuts next time around.

Intermezzo is located one block off State Street, right across from the post office and across the street from the Lobero Theatre, which usually has a nice lineup of acts.  One night we caught the Dave Brubeck quartet there and hit Intermezzo for an early dinner prior to the show.  This visit, we were on our way to a swing dance at the Carillo ballroom.  You gotta love Santa Barbara.

All in all, a fun, casual, and relaxing spot to either kick off your evening with a signature cocktail or a glass of wine, or to just camp out and graze for a few pleasant hours.  Highly recommended."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"I have had some great food every visit. We really enjoy sharing flatbreads and ordering starters like the brussel sprouts and then passing around one of their delicious burgers to share. Last visit I noticed a few new menu items, but didn't have a chance to try them. They've added some more bar type options like a street dog (bacon wrapped hot dog) and food truck pizza with carnitas. They make a good consistent cocktail. I'm bummed that they don't have a happy hour. In my experience service can be a little on the slow side here, but I like going when I have the time to relax near the fire place and enjoy some upscale bar food."

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Having traveled the world as well as around California, we can say unequivocally the restaurant exceeded our high expectations!
Our greeter was professional and efficient in seating us outside per my reservation request. 
The waiter 'Tucker', was personable, knowledgeable and  always ready to serve us. 
I ordered the prawns et al, with asparagus for a side dish. Both uniquely seasoned that brought flavor to both dishes -something I really enjoyed!
We also had the Special Steak (not on the menu) that was cooked to her perfection and again the flavor and tenderness was extremely good!
Our drinks- 'extra dirty' martini and Sauvignon  very good! 
It was a quiet beautiful evening there and afterwords I walked inside and was impressed with the cleanliness and understated class of ambiance- fireplace et al. 
Thanks to the owner for having such a wonderful restaurant!"

Hubby and I really enjoy Intermezzo Bar + Cafe. The food is simple yet delicious. I usually order the mussels and Hubby gets the burger. The cocktails are always wonderful, as is the wine. The ambiance is slightly upscale, yet still casual - very Santa Barbara. Trevor is a fantastic bartender and we usually sit at the bar to interact with him. When in a large group I enjoy sitting on the leather couches in the adjoining lounge. 

Most people I know usually don't enjoy the fried chicken, so I would not recommend ordering that. I also have been disappointed with their french fries. 

Intermezzo is a great place to go before dinner or a movie or if you're looking for a low key and romantic type atmosphere."

I had the pleasure of dining at Intermezzo on NYE with a group of friends and enjoyed their very well thought and executed 3-course prix fixe menu. We opted to start our meal with the caviar add-on. This was some of the best caviar I have tried, which was paired with all the accouterments and sparkling wine. I chose to do the wine pairing with my courses and was blown away at the quality of the wine, and was so pleased with how well it paired with my dishes. Each dish was beautifully presented, and each bite was better than the last. The chef is incredibly talented, I can't wait to try more of the food here! Our server was very knowledgeable and came with a dry sense of humor that really made for an entertaining dining experience. the room was decorated so nicely, and we were offered part favors to enjoy ringing in the new year. We stayed for a nightcap and rang in the new year, stomachs full, sufficiently imbibed, and feeling so welcomed by the whole staff and owner. We will definitely be dining here again, not just for special occasions, but for a frequent treat!!!"

I can tell you something about the service though. I made a reservation for Christmas Eve a few weeks ago, and the hostess just called me to tell me that instead of the regular menu, they will be offering a limited holiday menu and plan to charge $95 a person. We were planning to have young children with us, so yeah, that's not going to work. When I complained that she was leaving me in the lurch two weeks before a major holiday and that I had booked this far in advance, she put me on hold to take care of another customer. Goodbye Intermezzo, and good luck. Thanks for nothing."

PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"I really wanted to like this place. Our server Trevor was great. Knew the menu very helpful.

The execution out of the kitchen was inconsistent. I had the calamari taste was ok the amount of garlic was more than i like. The aoli had a heavy mayonnaise taste that over powered everything else. It felt like it was called in. 
The crispy chicken on the other hand was brilliant. The potatoes where smooth and creamy they added added something that I couldn't figure out that just brought the dish together. The chicken was white meat that can go dry if you don't watch how its cool. Moist to the last bite - but the skin on top was perfect. It had that signature crunch with a hint of seasoning. Perfect. The dinner entree was clearly made with love and care.

I next had the apple tart. At this point the meal was trending up and doing it fast. Then the apple tart with ice cream. Not a successful dish. First the ice cream was either sherbet or icey ice cream. The apple puck on top of the pasty tasted like bad tasting apples. While they removed it from my bill - it was just bad. I took a couple of bites but just could not finish. 

All in all i'd give this place other shot only because the dinner entree was so good. Clearly brilliance can come out of the kitchen."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"It took two hours for us to get our food, and during that time we were not checked on by the staff. When the food finally arrived it was not good. The burgers were sub par and the steaks were charred."

The pizza's are literally the best I have ever had in Santa Barbara - the Spicy Capicola is to die for!  Their specialty cocktails are fabulous and original.  But the best part - the service and the lovely ambiance, love their courtyard, especially living during these crazy COVID times. So glad they are back - we will be back again, again, and again!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"I've been coming to Intermezzo since its opening and I still love the ambiance and drinks. They've nailed causal elegance with dark wood accents, leather chairs, sharply dressed staff in all black and dim lighting. Service is usually spot on. Trevor - is a stand out employee. Whether he is behind the bar or working the floor he is attentive, personable and makes an exceptional cocktail. My go-to drinks are the Bee's Knees, Cucumber Martini, El Salud (fave), and Barney Shrubble. They also carry fabulous wines by the bottle or glass. Try the Margarum Rose on a hot day and be refreshed.

Where I feel Intermezzo can improve is the food. The quality and quantity has diminished over the years, while the prices have increased. A few years ago, I feel like they could get away  with that before places like the Black Sheep, Good Lion, Lark, etc were around. But now, there are just too many options for great cocktails and great food to settle for Intermezzo. Santa Barbara can do better than this. On my most recent visit I was so disappointed in the Ahi Tartare which was once one of my favorite starters at Intermezzo. Unfortunately it had evolved into a tiny tablespoon of ahi, pressed into a circle standing about a centimeter tall with three flecks of taro chip to scoop with. Imagine a single tortilla chip broken into three pieces and stuck in the dish, that's about the size of the taro flecks in my order. Oddly enough, as small as the taro pieces were it was nearly enough to scoop up all of the tuna because the portion was so small. Also disappointing was the Chicken Curry Salad. While I was entertained going on a scavenger hunt for actual chicken in the chicken salad, that did nothing to satisfy my appetite. There was more celery, mayo and lots of nutrient-less iceberg lettuce than anything. I also would not recommend the Chicken & Waffles - dry, dry, dry with little flavor, Steak Bites - meh, Mussels - no longer on the menu (but they were wonderful when they were served in that garlic sauce with grilled bread - not so much when they changed it to Thai Green Curry Sauce.) 

My final conclusion? Intermezzo provides a lovely atmosphere and fabulous drinks. It is excellent for a pre-dinner libation or after dinner night cap. However, gone are the days where you can enjoy drinks and a fabulous meal. Just has the food took a turn for the worse in my experience, I'm sure it can easily u-turn for the better with a little improvement on the menu. We'll be back for drinks though not likely when we're hungry unless we're in the mood to roll the dice."

I made a reservation for my girlfriend's birthday and we were both blown away by the service, food and ambiance. The restaurant felt cozy and classy. As for the food, we ordered the spicy capicola za (it's actually pretty spicy) and Spanish clams and it was delicious. The staff was knowledge and attentive.

I highly recommend the Naked and Afraid - a quality cocktail which changed my outlook on gin. At the end of our meal, the restaurant comped the Grasshopper nightcap we ordered as a birthday gift. Overall our evening was everything we hoped for and so much more!"

We did only appetizers and deserts but it was yummy!! The cheese platter comes with a piece of Honey Comb for the honey. I am a sucker of this. We also did their cauliflower dish with Parmesan cheese. It was pleasurably light for a meal so we were extremely happy with this. 

We sat at the bar & had fantastic service from Trevor. If you are ever up there ask to be served by Trevor who is very easy to converse with and great eye to be able to keep you entertained and pay attention to the other guests around you. He really makes you feel like your the only one there.

It has a mix of modern American food- burgers, flatbreads, and shared plates (ex: Brussel sprouts, calamari, ahi tartare). They have cocktails and wines by the glass. We shared the Brussel sprouts, pesto flatbread, and calamari. I had a Sauvignon Blanc and my husband had the Pinot noir. We were able to sit outside in February with heat lamps but inside also looked very cozy with a variety of couches, tables, and barstools. I would definitely go back!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"We LOVED our experience.  Oysters, flank steak, shrinp, manila clams, and meatballs.  Anejo, vino, and beer.  Jamie found a way to effortlessly make it all sing.  Amazing meal."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Patio cozy in the back, food amazing, service by Liz excellent. Had an amazing dinner with friends. Prices reasonable for quality of food. Must get meatballs, little gems Caesar, ciabatta bread and milkshake. Must get Capicola pizza! My friends loved Brown Betty and pink drink"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"What a romantic place. The service was on point and friendly, never felt rushed. Food was excellent, and appealing to the eye. Wine selection was perfect. This was our first visit, we will be returning."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Spent NYE at Intermezzo and it was absolutely fabulous!
From the Caviar service and Oysters Rockefeller to the Short Ribs and Filet Mignon and Halibut... just to name a few, all wonderful!! Service was great and the rock n roll vibe was killer!!  The NYE decorations and party favors were a nice bonus too!!  We can't wait to go back again!  Cheers and thank you Intermezzo for a most memorable New Years Eve!!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Food was excellent, service was delightful. We were 6 minutes early for the reservation and were given complimentary champagne during our wait and chatted with one of the owners. Staff was great, very informative on the menu and answering questions about wines and wine making. 

Amazing evening 10/10 recommend."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,negative,"Have eaten there many times.  Loved the Cask burger, seafood Salad, but now it's not the same. Food was mediocre at best. Won't go back. Very sad as SB needs good food."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"I worked across from Intermezzo for 3+ years and never actually went, so when a friend was visiting from out of town and asked for a nicer central restaurant to go to, I decided to give this place a shot. We had a larger group, party of 7, and made a reservation for 8:00, but they were very backed up and we ended up waiting for probably about an hour. That being said, they were incredibly apologetic and gave us two rounds of free champagne while we were waiting, which definitely helped. Once we finally sat down, we had our own little area to ourselves, which was awesome, and thus began probably one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. Our server was so charismatic and knowledgeable, and the owner John even came by to check on us and chatted with us for quite a while. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, including oysters on the half shell, pâté de campagne, steak frites (which was a special), gambas al ajillo, panko herb chicken breast, and sides of pan roasted mushrooms and potato gratin. One of my friends ordered the limoncello and ended up talking to our server about it, which we found out was made on site! He ended up taking us down to the cellar to show us his limoncello and mandarincello batches, as well as a chili-infused vodka, and all of this included free samples! Not only that, but there was a slideshow on the tv in our room, and while we were talking to John, he mentioned that he was in some of the slides, and said that if we were able to guess which ones, he'd give us a free round of shots. I scrutinized the photos and ended up guessing the correct ones, so we got free shots of tequila. We ended up closing out the restaurant and had such a fantastic time with the friendliest people. On top of that, all of the food was AMAZING. The steak frites was so perfectly cooked (and I'm not usually a big steak person), the chicken was delicious, and I absolutely loved the pâté. Oh, we also got the meyer lemon crème brûlée and espresso chocolate mousse for dessert, both incredible as well. Who would have known that a place I literally sat across the street from for years would end up giving me one of the most memorable restaurant experiences I've ever had?!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"This place was amazing. It was our 1 year anniversary and they had roses and rose pedals all over the table when we walked in and all of the staff wished us a happy anniversary. Our waiter was awesome, had amazing suggestions throughout the entire meal and made it a very enjoyable evening on such a special occasion. He even brought out the perfect desert and it was sooo good. Will definitely be returning here next year!"
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"We showed up sort of at the end of the night and had a couple of incredible burgers, really excellent flat bread and some wine.  
The Wine
Flying Goat Pino
omg I'm in love.  Enough said, can't wait to come back.  Fine wine selection and very good service by an overworked server-she did great though.  I love the cozy, dark atmosphere on a chill night and oh that Pino."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"This place was SO awesome. I came here with a friend last night, we sat at the bar for wine and food. We got the avocado & burrata toast, taco flatbread, cheese plate, and cauliflower. Everything we ordered was AMAZING. The avocado toast was perfectly shareable, the balsamic really added an awesome pop of flavor. The flatbread with carnitas, pepper & onion was such a great combo. If I lived in the area this would definitely be a regular place for me."
PPcz-0UtIJ8O7xDT551y2g,Intermezzo By Wine Cask,American,positive,"Unbelievable food and really excellent service. My husband and I enjoyed our first dinner out in 13 months and it couldn't have been better. We each got a pizza (pepperoni and margherita). They were some of the best pizzas we've ever had. We also split an arugula salad and a side of asparagus- these were both so good. Truly delicious. 

We also felt that their COVID protocols were great. We felt safe the entire meal. 

They wanted to treat my husband to dessert for his birthday but we were so full - instead they covered his beer. Was so thoughtful. Thank you thank you! We will definitely be back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Jasmine our Waitress did a great job of navigating us through a fabulous Menu ! We enjoyed our Prawn Cocktail, Scallops , and Calamari. The Cucumber Mojito and Margaritta's were Delicious ! We will be back for dinner soon , as all the food next to us looked Amazing! Views of Stearns Wharf and West Beach are Stunning from both Upstairs and Down . Great Restaurant Design and Location!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My family chose Bluewater Grill to celebrate our parents' birthdays. My father and I love lighthouses and found ourselves gravitating to this restaurant despite its heavy tourist location. The food was delicious. We had the crab artichoke dip, mahi mahi tacos, grilled octopus with potatoes, crab Louie salad, and a lobster roll. Dani, our waitress was a doll! She was patient, clear and just lovely. I greatly appreciate her kindness and patience to my older parents. The crab artichoke dish was hot, bubbling and delicious. The seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked. Dani brought a birthday sundae for my parents to enjoy towards the end of the meal. Everyone who worked at Bluewater Grill was exceptionally polite, thoughtful and welcoming. I applaud all the great people working at Bluewater Grill and look forward to coming again!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Food and atmosphere was very good.  Service was slow.  Worth going to if you have the time.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We were really looking forward to what the new lighthouse restaurant was going to look like, considering SB doesn't have many places to eat on the water.  It's nice, but what a misuse of space overlooking the water.  The patio is a joke, luckily the bar does have a view, still not the best use of window space.
The food was OK.  Nothing that I would have to go back to visit.  
What I couldn't understand, is it was FREEZING at the bar, was an overcast day, but no employee cared that the AC was on full blast and as we sat at the bar, three people complained to the female bartender who was a little snobby about the LA bread- great, we're in SB, source local, but she ignored everyone who said it was freezing, so she probably lost at least $60 in tips for 3 couples leaving the bar, on a not busy day."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Warning this is not the place to go if you hade serious shell fish allergies or are picky. Both of which I am but it's still a 5 Star experience. 

We went for happy hour and I had the draft Pilsner and my husband had the draft Hefeweizen. Both were delicious. 

I ordered the edamame and they were kind enough to put the hot dressing on the side. (See the above about picky eater). We also had the fish bites which were delicious and their crusty yeasty sourdough bread (yum!). Thank god we walked our 10,000 steps today!

Our bartender was super nice and generous with the pours, which brought us back the next day . 

We have been to the restaurant on Catalina island and now need to check out the one in Coronado."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Just had dinner at Bluewater Grill, food was delicious I have to say what top it was the service all the staff there is great very attentive too your needs. Also Raul thank you for taking care of us great service."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had a lovely time here for my boyfriend's birthday! The food was excellent and the ice cream they brought to him for his birthday was delicious. This location is still getting dialed in as it's pretty new, but no doubt that it'll continue to improve. It has been very busy every time we've gone in for HH and dinner, but we were still seated immediately."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I've gone here multiple times and have consistently had good food and service. Food cooked perfectly every time. I took a foodie friend (from San Fran, Nob Hill) here and he LOVED it. The scallop sashimi is one of the most amazing apps ever.  Nice selection of wine and drinks.  

As a local I'm very familiar with the food at all of the restaurants mentioned in other reviews--this restaurant is on par with them and in some aspects better.  Ambience here is hard to beat.   Not sure why some reviews here are so harsh and critical.  Maybe it's just because B.G. is the ""new guy"" in town? Whatever, I really like this place!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What a fabulous restaurant!!!  I was visiting Santa Barbara with my nieces and we decided to get something to eat.  We walked in and my nieces explained they had some dietary restrictions (gluten and nut allergy).  The hostesses were so excited to explain what all was available and so warm in their greeting that we decided to try it.  Best decision of the day.  We went for happy hour and shared the shrimp tacos, shrimp sliders and the crabmeat and artichoke dip.  All three dishes were incredible, however, if I was forced I guess I would say the slider was my favorite.  The restaurant is new as it opened March 12th but service was way better than some well-established restaurants.  Also the clean open design was a plus for me.  My only two regrets is that I didn't check out the second floor; it must have incredible views and I did not get a drink so I can not comment on that.  If you are in the area I strongly recommend this restaurant especially during Happy Hour."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We ate here for the first time and really enjoyed it!
The first impression for me is the clean fresh look and feel of the restaurant. No smell of fish in a fish restaurant is a good thing. They are kid friendly, the staff is over all friendly....last but not least the food is delicious! I ordered the crab BLT with a side of homemade potato chips. They have generous portions too. Incredible! I can't wait to go back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We're from Palm Springs and we were coming home from vacation as we passed through Santa Barbara. We were lucky enough to have dinner at the Bluewater Grill!  It was fabulous! 
Chanel, the chef, Marco, the sous chef, Carly, our server, we're all awesome! The women and men behind the kitchen we're creative and worked so hard to deliver a great meal! 
Our selections were delicious and the service was great! 
Anytime you're passing through, please stop and say hello to these folks; you won't be disappointed! We promised the manager, Colin and Danielle, the hostess, that we would post a review on Yelp! 
THE FOOD:
The crabcakes were delish!
This Sandabs and the potatoes au gratin were fabulous! 
The blackened halibut was awesome and the paella was so flavorful, a dish you don't always see on the menu! 
Thank you Bluewater Grill! See you again!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,An overall solid dining experience; fresh seafood at reasonable prices compared to other places. Been there twice with parties of 6 and 4 and our guests were very satisfied all-around.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The service here is fantastic! I was visiting Santa Barbara with my aunt and daughter and we had no idea where to eat dinner. I'm gluten intolerant, so I have to check for gluten free options everywhere I go. It's usually not a problem at most restaurants. I was surprised how many restaurants (on the pier and around State St.) had no gluten-free options. We walked into the Bluewater Grill and were immediately welcomed. We felt right at home and even though they don't have a gluten-free menu, the hostess was quick to point out all of the (many) gluten-free possibilities. Our server was also extremely helpful. He had a strong grasp of the menu and my options, but still offered to double-check with the chef to make sure I was taken care of. He was equally attentive to my daughter's nut allergy, and went the extra mile to ensure there was no cross-contamination with her food. We ended up eating off the happy hour menu, which gave me plenty of options. The fish tacos and crab and artichoke dip were amazing! I can't recommend this  restaurant enough. Next time I'm in Santa Barbara, it'll be at the top of my list!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The food was amazing, the place looked great! Super friendly staff! Treated my family and I very well. Definitely going back again for the delicious spicy edamame. Gerry, and all the staff was wonderful. Great customer service for all of you."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Had an amazingly delightful lunch at a very reasonable price . Super friendly service, ample, well presented portions with exceptional flavor!  Great fresh fish selections, specialty cocktails, extensive beer and wine list.  All this as well as the perfect location"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"A very poor first response.
The service was so slow and the food was just okay.
Another restaurant in Santa Barbara that thinks mediocre food and service can be accepted by the tourists and who cares about the locals."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We have been to many a Bluewater Grills in SoCal.  We were looking forward no matter how long it took for the Santa Barbara location to open (we live there now).  We were lucky enough to be invited to one of the ""rehearsal"" dinners.  Had a great time and looked forward to coming back once officially opened.  So things go a little downhill at this point...  Thought that going upstairs for a Sunday happy hour with that beautiful view was something to look forward to.  But when we arrived It seems no happy hour - depending on you ask.  The downstairs bartender said ""happy hour in 5 minutes at 3:00!!"".  The hostess said Manager just informed her they were no longer doing happy hours on Sunday.  The upstairs bartender said ""happy at 3:00 but only at the downstairs bar"".  Then at shift change the new upstairs bartender said she had no idea that happy hour was cancelled when we told her we were told that there was no longer any Happy Hour on Sundays.  She responded ""well that news to me.  I think it's happy hour"".    
Food is pretty good.  Prices are pretty good.  Service not so much but because it's terribly mismanaged.  Management's attitude was ""take it or leave it"".  Let's hope it's just some growing pains."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"First time at this location, but 2nd time eating at Bluewater.  We had the shrimp skewers and Halibut special. Both were good.  I had their birthday Sunday, which was very good.  Never had McConnell's ice cream, but it was rich and delicious.  If you get the right seat, there is a nice new of the ocean."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Service was great; wait staff was on point. Husband was in mood for fish and chips - just ok, batter needed a lil something. I had the New England chowder - very good. My sister had the lobster bisque - sorry to say, it was a lil bland. My brother in law had the San Francisco ciopinno (sp?) with pasta, tasty.  Other dishes from neighboring diners looked very good; we would come back and try other dishes."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Our first night in Santa Barbara on this trip and the concierge at The Hilton Hotel recommended the Bluewater Grill.  The food was very good (paella and halibut).  Carlos, our server, was even better.  Nice, with good recommendations, and great follow up.  Highly recommend."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The food is excellent.....ambitious amazing and a friendly staff. I would recommend happy hour, price point is on point. Thank you Santa Barbara for entertaining my palate......cheers!!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"3.5 I agree with the less than stellar reviews..they need help in the kitchen.  I will go back a 3rd time for the outdoor patio (if you can get a spot..reserve )but sadly the fish was not cooked well and the side veggies were overcooked, bland and just a major disappointment.  Liked the generous drinks Mai Tai and Mojito.  Warm bread too tempting and good. But calamari was nothing special, fish nothing special, and lava cake did not ooze out at all. they described it that it would but didnt and manager was like oh well even..he was polite and liked our server but please i want you to be awesome...get some kitchen guidance.  I know you can do better and build a loyal following"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Really fun new location. Had a simple lunch (ahi poke) and a glass of wine. Pleasant staff and nice atmosphere. Looking forward to visiting again.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This is the place to bring visitors to show off Santa Barbara! Delicious food in a beautiful lighthouse building right next to Stearn's Wharf on Santa Barbara Waterfront. Who could ask for more! Was impressed by both HH and lunch. The crab BLTA is sooo good!! As is the baked crab and artichoke dip! I'll be back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Fabulous location across from the pier! I loved the ocean views. It was overcast and chilly when I was there so I had to sit inside. I loved the Manhattan clam chowder and the scallops. Great service! I will be back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Took my family on a day trip to SB and we arrived starving. It was by chance we saw an inviting restaurant at the end of state st near the pier. We walked in and it looked brand new. Took a peek and the menu and we couldn't wait to eat. They have only been only 15 days and we're out of few things no big deal. My dad ordered the gumbo, I got the salmon and mom had the fish and chips. Sourdough bread arrived first with piping hot steam coming out and butter! Delicious!!! All the food we ordered was incredible! So fresh and hot and perfect. Our server was AMAZING!!! And our drink waiter was attentive and so incredibly nice. Don't miss out on this jem!!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"First time here and definitely not the last! Ordered calamari, rosemary chicken, and seafood Louie. All dishes were fresh and delicious. Our awesome waiter Michael was helpful and attentive. Highly recommend this restaurant"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Only post in extraordinary circumstances, brought my family here for some seafood only to be blown away by the food and service. My family sat at the oyster bar only because of the long wait. The swordfish, scallop skewers and the Idaho rainbow my family ordered was to die for....I tried each of dishes, was blow away. Best was yet to come, the chef handed over the glass a complimentary plate of wonderfully prepared raw scallop's. Over the top, never had it before, completely hooked. Coming from Boston, I had the best (think Legal Seafood & Anthony's Pier 4), they are nothing compared to this. Highly recommend!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Love this new spot!!! Great staff, graciously took back two drinks that weren't up to snuff, but they made it right!!! The food was off the hook & to wait it for the upstairs deck was worth it, views right on El Cabrillo. Go here, we want it to stick around!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Just finished a fantastic lunch with some of the freshest fish! Everything was well done, from the bread to the sides (great fries and homemade potato chips!). Grilled octopus appetizer was perfectly prepared. But the highlight of the experience was the service. Carly was friendly, attentive, informative and all-around lovely. Can't say enough good things about the whole experience."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great place to have lunch or dinner or a drink at the bar that has an incredible ocean view. The service is excellent and the food delicious!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Beautiful location. Great atmosphere. We had friendly service. I really liked the spicy edamame and my NE clam chowder. I was disappointed with my grilled halibut, very bland. My friend had the grilled, skewered scallops and she felt hers had no flavor as well. 

I returned today for lunch and had the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp. Excellent! Great service as well."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My GF ordered the steak and lobster. The steak was supposed to be med, it was med-well and the potatoes were cold. It is supposed to come with brocoleni but came with asparagus. They brought fresh potatoes and brocoleni.  The brocoleni was warm. The second round of cocktails tasted wrong.  I asked for the check and he cleared our plates, we weren't done yet."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I wrote a negative review recently because of an unhappy experience when trying to visit their happy hour. But the owner graciously contacted me and extended us an offer we couldn't refuse. Went there last night and were treated royally, especially by manager Colin and server Brittney. The owner, Jim, had made sure we were well taken care of, and my wife and I very much enjoyed our experience. Thank you! High points: the Bombay Sapphire martinis, the wonderful sourdough bread, the price of the rock lobster tail-- $38.50 for a really good size tail. 11 oz., I think. Everything seemed to be priced right. A couple of criticisms-- very loud, especially downstairs, but the restaurant was crowded and busy. Didn't care for the green rice, and the grilled octopus didn't live up to expectations. Tender, but lacked flavor. All in all, Blue Water redeemed itself admirably, and I would recommend that anyone give it a chance. It's only been open a month and is still ironing a few things out. Thanks again for treating us so well."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We were pretty disappointed with this restaurant. The service was bad, we had to ask 6 times for water and got it at the end of the meal. Our soups came one hour after we were seated. Some of the fish bas burned and the chiopino could use some serious improvement."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Very nice location, i'd get a reservation or opt to sit at the bar.  Everything here is fresh, just don't be caught off guard by the prices, paying for what you get, which is excellent food, but you are also across the street from the ocean (so pretty much every spot has a ocean view) and everyone knows that Santa Barbara isn't the cheapest place either.  They do have a happy hour which if you are looking for a quick and small bite with a beer, what we did, this place is a good choice, won't break the bank and is good.  The service from the hostess to the bartender were quick and professional.  Overall, its a good place to go.  If you are price sensitive hit their happy hour or check out another spot.  It also would be a great place to take a date if you are looking for seafood based meals.  Good luck!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Was walking by and decided to stop in for lunch during our visit to Santa Barbara. Had a tasty lunch (salad and shrimp tacos) and enjoyed the beautiful view from the patio. Both the hostess and Jasmine, our waitress, were extremely personable and friendly. We would definitely come back next time we're in town."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What a wonderful lunch! Everything was just perfect from the appetizer to coffee. However, Carly, our waitress was the best part. She was informed, attentive, inquired what our names were and made us feel so remarkably comfortable and welcome. Brava Carly!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This is a amazing newly opened seafood restaurant. The experience was great. Service was excellent. Being a seafood fanatic this really hit the spot on all of my taste buds. Will definitely be back soon.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place was good but what made the nexperience  was the awesome bartender, Andrew! I've never been to Santa Barbara before .. this was my first stop and it already made my trip! I love good people behind the bar... you don't always get that but I was so grateful for his help and great energy!! I'll be coming back anytime I'm in SB!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Service was a little slow, but overall we had a great time. We sat at the table that's off to the side, it's nice, but a little isolated"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"During a quick short vacation to Santa Barbara, we were on Cabrillo Boulevard and decided to get some dinner. We walked into the Blue Water Grill and my first impression was that this restaurant was not very well organized since the young hostesses had no idea what they were doing with a Lobby full of people. should have turned around and found another restaurant. However we decided to wait and the assistant manager finally assist of this in finding seating upstairs in their Lounge area. Was talking to the bartender about the menu and their fish and he recommended that is an accompaniment to my fish entree I try the brussel sprouts. We did order an appetizer which was okay but then my aunt Ray came and the brussel sprouts we're way under cooked and they yellowtail tuna was very dry. I asked the bartender to try the brussel sprouts but he could not because of his braces so gave it to his bar back who confirm that the Sprouts were undercooked. No apologies for the recommendation. My suggestion based on this one experience for anybody looking for a fish restaurant in Santa Barbara avoid this place for at least the next year until they get their act together."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What a wonderful place! People are friendly, the bar upstarts is wonderful. The setting is beautiful if you like to overlook the beach. The bartenders are knowledgeable and kind. The hostesses are on their game. The manager is right there working along with the team. Waiters are helpful and efficient. Food is fresh and delicious!The white sea bass is wonderful. The seafood pasta is amazing, octopus appetizer along with spicy edamame were fantastic. And, they even have organic and local sides to accompany their delicious entrees. We have been there several times and every time has been a fabulous experience. Highly recommended!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place was excellent. There were a few bumps with service, but considering they had just opened I was impressed to see them hit the ground running with the food! The lighthouse building is deserving of a restaurant of this caliber. 

We ordered the chilled seafood platter, a wedge salad, crab cakes and mussels. Some old standards, but the quality of the seafood and execution stood out. I will definitely be back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Having waited on a Friday evening for 20 mins for a table  my party of four were expecting a great experience. Unfortunately that was not the case. I had the grilled salmon which as our waiter recommended should have been medium rare. It arrived very well done and I promptly sent it back. My daughters kids meal was pretty inedible. The good. Our tuna  poke was tasty and  was on the whole pretty good. 
the bad  - the service was very disorganized and we had to ask five wait staff for a glass of water before my wife had to go to reception and get the manager to come over. 

Who knows what the issues were on this night but there are too many good choices in town to warrant coming back for another try."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had the shrimp & scallops pasta, lobster roll, shrimp tacos & scallops skewers. All were delicious. The service was great. One of our entrees was very slow to come out. They apologized with an extra glass of wine & dessert."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"One day in santa Barbara and we were headed to he pier for a family lunch. Uber driver told us to try this place instead. At first... Great ambiance, service.  The venue was beautiful.... The bread and butter was amazing.     We ordered a varaiance of things. Most notable was the lobster roll.... Crab blta then squid ink pasta. The grilled seabass was a little salty.. But for the lost part this was a great Santa Barbara experience...and we would be happy to come again soon."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I wish I could say I liked this, but when the best thing you had was the spinach side, something's wrong. Our friends ordered the crab and artichoke appetizer for the table; it's not what I would have picked and I was right. Why bury crabmeat in a Mornay sauce? (Then again, why pair it with artichokes?) For the entrée, I ordered sand dabs. I get it that it's a mild fish (good luck finding grilled sardines, mackerel or bluefish in a place like this), but mild shouldn't mean devoid of flavor. It was supposed to be sautéed in olive oil and lemon juice and finished with lime (an odd treatment, but I thought I'd give it a shot); I couldn't discern any of the citrus notes, and the zipless chermoula sauce on the side added nothing. 
I have to say I'm surprised, and disappointed. It's an attractive restaurant, with good service, but the two dishes I had were mediocre, at best. This doesn't make sense - they're not an independent restaurant (there are other Bluewater Grills), so you expect competence, even if the food isn't exciting. I'm sorry to say that it didn't even hit that mark. (FWIW, my wife, whose reaction was the same as mine, had been there for lunch and happy hour, both of which she said were very good, but like me, has no interest in giving it another try.)"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Beautiful restaurant with great seafood. Two fun bars!   One on the main floor and one up stairs with a view of the bay.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We had a quite disappointing experience at Bluewater Grill. The view and cocktails are great, that's why I gave 3 stars instead of 1, but a dining experience was absolutely not satisfying. We ordered a steamed mahi-mahi (it was important to get the fish steamed since I'm on a strict diet and can't eat anything grilled/sautéed) and a grilled swordfish with herb sauce and vegetables. Each entry costs about $25-30, so we expected a good quality dish. The mahi-mahi came grilled instead of steamed and waitress said that they steamed it first and then grilled (which doesn't make any sense so I'm pretty sure they just screwed up our order and lied to us, because I can distinguish between steamed and grilled fish, and that was grilled). The swordfish came without sauce and tasted over cooked.
Overall impression that we went to a cheap fish fast food, not a restaurant. Definitely not worth spent money. If you want a good fish go to SB fish company, if you are up for the view and cocktails, then Bluewater Grill might be all right."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Excellent service, beautiful location. Highly recommend the grilled octopus appetizer, it was cooked perfectly.  We got the swordfish, rainbow trout amadine, halibut and panko shrimp. All of us loved what we ordered. It's pricey though, but it's seafood in downtown Santa Barbara."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I made an impromptu trip to Santa Barbara and as I got off the train I desperately needed a bite. I walked up and down State St and could not find a single place open mid afternoon. Ridiculous but as soon as I was about to give up I came across Bluewater Grill. I walked in and the hostess was super super nice it was so pleasant after a 4 hour train ride and a scavenger hunt for food. She escorted me upstairs to the bar and WOW. The vibe was amazing. The bartender, Tanya, was also extremely pleasant. I ordered a drink, two shots, and a salmon ciabatta sandwich. My French 75 was great great great. My deux shots of Don Julio were poured generously and promptly. Thank you Tanya! The sandwich was amazing. I loved the cocktail of the greens, salmon, dressing, and warmed ciabatta bread. What a great experience. 10/10 would come back next time I'm in Santa Barbara. A highlight of my trip. Would have no reservations recommending it to friends and family. Total bill was: $50"

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Disaster... quoted 15 mins for a table over the phone, waited for an hour. Seems like no one knows what's going on. Waitress had attitude and was never around. Took 15 mins for water."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,The service was fabulous. Drea was the best. We had cocktails with blue cheese olives and scallops with caviar and the best view in Santa Barbara! This is a must. Seafood and drinks .... this is the place to go.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Amazing opening night. The food was amazing! In particular the calamari, sandabs, the spicy edamame, swordfish, wine selection and more! Gerry, the manager on duty exhibited incredible customer service. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Thank you for an amazing dinner!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,They have great clam chowder and free Valet parking. The service is great and everything we ordered was delicious.Lobster rolls could be a little bigger though.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Beautiful restaurant. Spicy edamame is my favorite. Ordered a cucumber mojito which was perfect. Our server Ricardo was very attentive and polite. All staff is very friendly.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We have previously dined at Bluewater on Catalina Island.  The owner told us they would be opening in Santa Barbara and that when we were there we should try it. So we did!  We were fortunate enough to dine at a table looking into the kitchen.  Chanel who is their chef was really fun to watch at work as were her employees.  One of the younger kitchen assistants who was working at the salad station was so intent on his work that it was fascinating.  Clearly his dream is to be a chef some day.  We watched her inspect every plate leaving the kitchen as well as shuck oysters and direct the staff.  John had halibut and  I had the fish and chips.  We came directly from a day spent on the beach.  My fish and chips were excellent.  Crispy, not greasy.  His fish was well seasoned and presented.  Our experience was as good as Catalina.  We love Catalina and Santa Barbara.  They are a nice break from our home in the desert. We will be back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Well, this would have been 4 stars.. I was considering 2 stars but I will average it over my 3 visits. The first 2 times were great. I even hosted a large birthday dinner there with about 13 people and they were very accommodating. I really like the food and I also think their kids menu is one of the best in town. I have to downgrade my rating based on my visit this week. I made reservations 3 weeks prior for the outside seating. The hostess said that was totally fine. Ok great, I show up there and they seat my party inside. The extremely rude man at the hostess station explained to me that they never guarantee outside seating with reservations, that's fine if it's true but don't you think all of the host staff should have the same knowledge? He had a horrible attitude which made things worse. I had planned on purchasing a gift card that night for a coworker and opted to purchase at Finneys instead purely because of how rude that person was and I didn't want to deal with getting a gift card from him. Lastly, our waitress was SO bad. She seemed like she was on another planet the whole time and also gave us the wrong bill. Bluewater Grill has very good food and the location is great, I think you all need to invest in better staff."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We tried going to a few other restaurants before stopping here at Bluewater Grill but being so close to closing time we were told no or if we were to order food we would have to hurry. So walking by to one of our regular spots we thought we would give Bluewater a try and see what they said. They took us no problem. (In fact they took another couple about 10 min after we got there) They didn't tell us we had to hurry or anything.  We got a great seat with a lovely view. I'm sure glad we stopped. We were very pleased with the food, drinks, service and atmosphere."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What a fabulous place in a perfect location! The old lighthouse building has been beautifully revamped into a chic, sleek, multi-level eatery that's not at all intimidating. We ate at the downstairs bar to check out the action in the open kitchen but next time I'll be watching the sun set from the 2nd floor patio. My blackened redfish was flawless--tender, tasty, perfectly seasoned and accompanied by the best Mojito I've ever had. Good luck, Bluewater. Can't wait to go back!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Horrible service...the staff walked around with there heads in the clouds. Twice we went and both times bad. The newport beach blue water is the best . The general manager is from the newport blue water he should no what works and how to keep your locals coming back . I don't ever want the hostess running after me pulling on my shoulder to ask me if I have a reservation to sit upstairs. Really??? Wont be back until they get it together
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Patio is gorgeous. A great place to pop in for a quick drink and appetizer.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,The crab BLTA was so fresh and delicious. Fries done just right. My husband ordered the ahi Tuna sandwich which our waiter recommended and he wasn't disappointed. Seating on the patio is a must for the views of the wharf and ocean. Great service.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great food, service, and atmosphere. My husband and I enjoyed dinner and cocktails in a booth on the second floor. Megan was our server who provided great service and recommendations. Definitely recommend the chowder, calamari, and the crab legs - they are huge!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This place is newly opened we frequent Santa Barbara often and always looking for good food this place is very good and prices where great and reasonable as well highly recommend instead of the  many over rated restaurants in SB
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,I hate to do this but I'm pissed. We sat down the waiter took our appetizer order edamame with our drinks. 25 min later they bring our soup then they inform me they are out of edamame. Prior to that I ordered king crab legs then they told me 10 min later they are out of king crab legs. At least the clam chowder was good otherwise I would have given them a complete hell no. The manager tried but wow he needs training. DONT EAT HERE
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Bluewater Grill, the eighth outpost in a small chain of seafood restaurants, opened near Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara in March 2018. It's surprising, this being a beach town, that there are relatively few seafood specialists in the city. There's Enterprise, and also the nearby Fishhouse and Boathouse, which has common ownership with Fishhouse. I must say that Bluewater will now be my fave seafood destination. Their menu is expansive, the service is first-rate, and both the presentation and quality of the food are top notch. They have a full bar and what appears to this non oenophile to be a classy wine list. While the prices aren't inexpensive, they're on a par with other similar restaurants. I certainly plan on visiting often."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This place was great! The staff was very friendly and very accommodating when we wanted to move to a different table. The crab cakes were especially good!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The kitchen was WAY behind, which is definitely forgivable, although surprising for one of the few nearly beachfront restaurants in downtown SB. Unfortunately our waiter disappeared for about 45 minutes so we had no idea what was going on. Finally, long after we'd finished our bread and drinks, we were offered some free (and delicious) chowder and informed that it was still going to be awhile.

After another half hour or so our waiter reappeared and we asked to cancel our main dishes because it was getting very late, and just have the beet salad we'd ordered as an appetizer. He came back about 10 minutes later to deliver the mains and let us know they were out of beet salad and had canceled ours.

The food wasn't all that great, but thankfully they comped most of the meal.

To top off all the lack of professionalism, we spent most of the time watching the bartenders do shots and talk trash about the servers.

Just all around not a very romantic anniversary dinner."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"the worse customer service by waitress!! food is tasteless. i order a bottle of pellegrino which waitress forgot about and didn't recall untill 45 minutes later when i was getting ready to leave( by this time i was alrteady speaking to the day time manager ) which he was the same as the employee...as whatever!!! there is  way better restaurants in santa barbara. racist waitress he should be working somewhere else not dealing with customers "" if he hasn't realized thanks to all of us he has a job.
the owner/co-owner need to know that his/her employees are giving a really bad reputation to his/her restaurant."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great BLTA! Has fresh crab and the best avocado ever. Wonderful Bloody Mary's with a large shrimp included!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Literally the best lunch I ever had. If you don't get the chorizo and mussels you are soooooo missing out. Go upstairs and take in the view.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,BEWARE!!!!    Had to post one star in order to post this.   Attempted to go here for dinner; fully aware there would be a wait for an upstairs outside patio table. Was told it was a 20-30 minute wait.  No problem. Went upstairs to wait at the bar.  UPSTAIRS BARTENDERS ARE AMAZING!  While waiting for our table observed the hostess sit another party that arrived after we did. When I asked about it the man hostess told me it was not possible; I explained I watched this take place -- he still told me I was wrong.  BOLD FACE LIE!!!  Very disappointing experience and we will NOT be back!!  Can not stand a lair!!  My money is better spent elsewhere!!  We went to Tomas and had an amazing dinner and service!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The perfect location with the most amazing seafood - simply melts in your mouth!  The service was impeccable, very attentive wait staff making my large table feel special the whole time we were having dinner.  With a full bar and amazing wine list run don't walk to the best restaurant in Santa Barbara"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,My husband and my 1 year old loved this place! We came here on a whim after trying to find a place to eat after our visit to the sb zoo. Great happy hour and food. Will be back here!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Went in for the first time today after much anticipation since we moved here. At first we were excited to be sat on the patio... until we waited for nearly 20 minutes just to watch a couple seated about 3 minutes earlier get served. The server walked out on the patio, looked at us, and then turned to the other table and sat down bread and began taking their order. We immediately got up and left. No one acknowledged us the entire time. Very disappointed."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Amazing fresh fish, the swordfish was incredible, and my wife had the Mahi Mahi that was also super delicious. Great location and cool venue. Really great service and friendly bartenders. Can't wait to come back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Overall a fan from my first visit.  My husband and I stopped here recently for an early dinner on a weekend.  It was a beautiful day and we were seated near a window, which was really lovely.  Our server was very attentive and upbeat, enhancing our visit.  She was knowledgeable about the menu and had good suggestions for us.  Hubby and I both got appetizers and an entrée.  I loved my roasted heirloom cauliflower and he liked his smoked fish plate.  Our entrées weren't quite as on-spot: my trout was overcooked, slightly blackened (not from seasoning) and too dry.  My husband's sandwich came with the wrong side.  They fixed his side pretty quickly and overall he was happy with his food.  My fish was underwhelming but their house-made potato chips are really fantastic and for everything else, I'd give it another try.  I would consider something besides the fish dish I got, but other than that we wouldn't make too many changes.  Atmosphere is lovely, the restaurant is well-lit and attractive, and the restroom was clean and well stocked.  Great location, and even has some dedicated parking."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Definitely in my waterfront rotation! Everything is great quality. Mussels with chorizo and scallops on half shell were my favorites.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Thanks to the entire team at Blue Water Grill for making our celebration night so special- the entire staff made it an incredibly wonderful experience.  Your team helped hang decorations and provided phenomenal service.  Our server- Carley, went SO above and beyond to make the everything so memorable.  The steak was perfectly cooked and delicious and the Mahi Mahi was sensational!  The decor and view cannot be beat!  We can't wait to return!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I had good expectation for this place. My bf and I were looking forward to a nice dinner and drinks by the beach. However, it was not!
Although we we're greeted friendly by the manager (wish I would have asked his name), our server Sean was not.  By the time Sean returned with the waters the manager had already gotten our drinks and appetizer order. John seemed to be very attentive to his other costumers yet not  us. Sean finally took our order and approx. 30min after our food finally came out and it was cold :/ 
I still wanted to end the night on a good note so I ordered some bubbly. Yet again Sean decided to procrastinate on my request. He picked up dirty dishes from a table that was empy, served 2 other tables drinks and still no bubbly. I finally just cancelled my drink and requested the check. Id hate to think his negligence was do to my skin color but, it sure felt that way."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Worst service I've ever received.  We've been to the Redondo Beach and Newport Beach Blue Water's, but we will never return to this one.  

First, they gave alcohol to my son.  DID NOT CARD HIM!  Isn't that against the law!?!  He ordered an oyster shot. On the menu, it has 'oyster shot' $3 and under it with a shot of vodka (in smaller letters) $5.  He takes it and starts gagging and turning red.  After checking his glass and my other sons oyster shot, it had vodka.  I go to the counter to bring this issue up with the manager and he basically hovers over me and says ""that's the way they're made!.""  Do they take the vodka out after a minor or someone else who doesn't want alcohol and asks.  I point to the menu and it clearly say oyster shot, by itself.  He then looks at me and says, ""what are you asking for sir!""   Really.  That is the response to a complaint?  Did not apologize first.  No personality, no compassion.  What do you want me to do!   

Secondly, the waiter rollers his eyes when my older son decides on a different dish because they don't make it the same way they do at the Redondo Beach restaurant.  Rolls his eyes.  Are we back in grade school.  Then he mixes up orders, get 2 orders wrong and forgets my older sons order.   

My older son And my wife order Arnold Palmers and he comes back and tells my younger son, who didn't order it, that they were out of lemonade.   Never told us they ran out of lemonade.  Finally my older son orders a coke and the waiter never brought it.  

The only bright spot of this whole ordeal was the helper Justin.   He actually came to assist and make up for the waiters lack. 

I also noticed the manager greeting and saying bye to customers as they were leaving.  When we were getting ready to leave, he walked away.  Never apologized.  How sad.  And they actually added gratuity on the check.  I alway tip very good...this time I did it for one of my worst experiences in a restaurant."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,A view and good food. So delicious. Can't wait to return.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Well a coworker warned me about coming here...I should have listened!

We walk in on a beautiful Saturday afternoon for some drinks, maybe a few bites to try it out. Walk in to find a very cute downstairs bar and as we make our way that direction we're told by the hostess that the downstairs is closed, please go upstairs...o.k. no problem!

Arrive upstairs, bar itself is full, booths that are available (2 of them) are filthy dirty...maybe outside? Sure enough an outdoor table was open which we took. Two seconds later a ""manager"" showed up to tell us they had a waiting list for upstairs and we had to vacate the table...WTF. We decided to leave.

A few pointers for you Bluewater folks;

1. We're 25+ year locals as were the coworkers that warned us not to come here...lose the locals and you'll soon be gone. (They tried twice to give you a fair chance)
2. If the upstairs has a waiting list why did you close the downstairs? Brilliant management style. Having a bartender is really a huge expense...lol.
3. Have a hostess upstairs if you can't sit yourself...no one was available.
4. Have one of the 4 people we seen behind a pretty small bar clean the dirty tables.
5. Your ""local"" seafood menu is hardly that and BTW Red Drum (your seasonal special..LOL) is a farm raised product generally from China or Thailand since its a protected game fish in most of its native waters...I think I hear the Sysco truck backing up."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"First time at Bluewater for lunch on Sunday.  Incredible location and views, especially on the bar (top) level.  The staff was very friendly, welcoming and professional.  Specifically, our server Carly was a true joy.  She is a professional foodie and offered wonderful suggestions without being imposing.  A call-out to the whole team though as they were all involved in making this a wonderful experience.  The food was very good.  We had clam chowder, seared scallops and a lobster roll.  Don't miss the house-made key lime pie along with very good coffee.  As I said, the food was very good but I think a little more time and effort and they can move it to exceptional which I think is important as the menu pricing reflects ""exceptional"" food.  Still, it was five stars in my opinion due in no small part to our server Carly who left us feeling welcome and appreciated for dining with them.  We'll be back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great food & wonderful service! They accommodated our large group quickly at lunchtime. It got chilly outside and they offered us blankets.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Three of us dined at this restaurant Sunday evening.  Carlos, our waiter, was very attentive and did not rush us. Two of our party had a seafood platter which they enjoyed very much.  I had cioppino and it was delicious.  The sun at that time was a problem because the window covering is not adequate.  Our servings of Johnny Walker Black were skimpy to say the least.  We were so fortunate to find one empty spot right by the door but otherwise parking could be a very large problem."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"3.5 socal family of sustainable seafood restaurants. large portions.  calamari fritti could have lighter batter and grilled octopus could have some crispier portion.  roasted whole fish was pretty good, petrale sole amandine huge size with a lot of panko and almond.  kids meal could be better and had mushy grapes"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Small portions and Overpriced and the 12 years old ""hostest"" is horrible. She's  probably the owner's  daughter or something otherwise i dont see a reason why she's  there. Sucking her candy infront of my face with a long face and freaking attitude. Lame!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Everything was excellent here.

We sat upstairs and were able to get a great view of the ocean.

The clam chowder and fish and chips are some of the best I have ever had. My girlfriend got the tuna tartare it was delicious.

Service was fast and attentive, what more could you ask for?"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Spinach with plastic! We are not from the area, and after carefully reading the Yelp reviews on this place we decided to give it a go. The ambiance is good. Service and food not as good. My husband and I ordered a side of sautéed spinach with our fish. A big chunk of melted plastic was mixed with my spinach and my husband found small pieces of plastic on his spinach as well. We complained to the waitress and we got the spinach replaced. I couldn't eat the replaced spinach. Plastic melts and I didn't want to take the risk. We ordered the check and the waitress didn't even bother to give us a discount or not charge for a dish. In fact, i was about to sign the tablet when one of our guests intervened. If it weren't for the grandmother to complain about it, the manager wouldn't haven even been known about what happened. My experience with restaurants is that if there's something wrong with the food, the waiter goes and notify the manager, who will act on it. In our case, we had to ask her to do her job. We are not from the area and our accent and way of behaving reveals that. That gets me to wonder if this place is a tourist tap or if the restaurant was negligent in serving us. Regardless, I am glad that I won't be coming to this restaurant never again. 
The manager was kind and understanding. The seafood was good but our dinning experience was ruined by spinach with plastic and the disregard of the waitress over the plastic incident. That being said, the two stars I am giving to this place goes to the ambiance."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Horrible service and mediocre food for the price! My wife and I ordered sandwiches, not complicated, and my kids had hamburgers, kids meals came out 20 minutes before our meals - two other groups that came in after received their meals before our basic sandwiches. Wouldn't go back - too many other choices. If you're in SB and can get right into a restaurant on a Saturday- think twice, there's probably a good reason."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The Red Lobster of Santa Barbara. Good service and beautiful space, but the food is exceedingly mediocre."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I have eaten at Bluewater Grill a few times now, including this past New Year's Eve.  You can't beat the location and the food is consistently good.

My hands down favorite is the ponzu sashimi sea scallop appetizer.  The balance of citrus and soy complement truly complement the scallop.  The mussels with chorizo is also a great way to start your meal.  Although I am not an uni/sea urchin fan, others that have dine with me have enjoyed the fresh local Santa Barbara sea urchins.

The fish that I have had for mains has been good (ahi and salmon), but not stellar.  The crab BLTA that I had on a lunch visit was yummy.

The wine list is decent, but they need to better manage inventory.  On New Years Eve they were out of a couple of the mid-priced whites and when they brought the bottle we finally settled on, we were told it was the last one.  If we had wanted another bottle, we would have had to move even further up the price ladder.

Overall, great location, good food and service."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Laid back lunch place with great views. Loved the crab / Avocado salad. Pedro was also a great bartender!!!

Do not miss it!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Delicious and the service was incredible (thanks to Jack). We were apprehensive about coming due to some recent negative reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised.

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Love, love this place. My wife and I are from out of town on our first day of being married. This place made us feel like locals, loved and welcome. And on top of that the quality of service was superb, not to mention their food and dessert. What a place to attend on our early adventure together. Shout out to the staff that served us that day, Dani and Yvonne! Thank you two and the others so much!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"With the recent spat of negative reviews we were pretty hesitant about going, but since it was just down the street from our hotel we decided to roll the dice and give it a try.  I'm really glad we did. The service was terrific, the ambiance was modern and stylish, and we had a great view of the ocean. And the food was really good too. I went with 2 appetizers instead of an entree and both the crab cakes and the scallops were delicious. My wife got the snapper and while it had a nice flavor and presentation, it was a bit dry. We shared a HUGE slice of mud pie for desert and it was good too... not mind-blowing great, but pretty tasty and definitely worth $8."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Went there for Father's Day lunch... by a mishap of being ignored at Enterprise Fish Co. boy were we happy o end up here. The staff was super accommodating (we had our two kiddos with us) the food was fantastic and the service was great. Our server Don was the best. Thank you for making Father's Day a success!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"If you want seafood by the water this is the BEST place to go to!  Let's start with their sourdough bread!! Hot and delicious!  The clam chowder is a home run!  If you can't decide if you want New England or Manhattan style--get them both!  They do 1/2 & 1/2!!  The presentation of the crab cakes are not only a work of art but off the charts delicious!  If you enjoy octopus, the octopus appetizer is a must!!  So tender and fresh that you'll want to order again and again!  The oysters couldn't have been any fresher and the muscles with chorizo was a first and won't  be the last!  The flavors were amazing.  If you like lobster rolls, they do not disappoint!  Rather than trying the traditional cold version I'm used to, I tried the hot buttered version they also offer.  It's my new favorite!  The food couldn't have been any fresher and we enjoyed everything that was ordered!  The location and views are outstanding.  The ambience and service are exceptional!  Our server Neva never missed a beat--she was knowledgeable and gave us incredible service!  The entire staff is friendly, accommodating and welcoming.  When in Santa Barbara this is a must!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I hope this restaurant can improve its performance. Great venue, service and views. The food falls short relative to the original restaurant in Redondo Beach. My husband's chipotle was served barely warm in temp. He was given a tiny spoon and no fork to remove the seafood and no bowl to place his shells. My sand dabs were unsalted, limp and white in color vs the lovely, salty, crispy brown when cooked properly. Plus they pour the sauce onto the fish which destroys its crispness, unlike the original restaurant. It also takes way too long to receive the food. Servers are excellent. I remain hopeful but disappointed that we had such a poor meal."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"A great experience.  Sat at the bar upstairs.  Service was perfect and food was great.  Tried several dishes and all were unique and different.  Give it a try 

We eat here most weeks.  Was very good in the beginning, but unfortunately that is no longer the case.  Now very inconsistent.  No quality control at the pass.  Very sad."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Had a great time with my girl at the diamond in the ruff. The food was rich and wholeheartedly flavorful. The person taking care of us Richie didn't even let our water get below half full. He's pairings were as described. Try the chowda!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This is my favorite fish house in Santa Barbara. Similar to Lure but better and tastes fresher. Come to Bluewater at lunch at sit upstairs because the view is wonderful!! Service is 100% as well. I will be back and visit frequently. Also easy parking
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I came in for dinner with my cousin about 40 minutes before closing. At first, we were excited about the menu, but the service was bizarre and uninviting. My Cesar salad was essentially just a plate of romaine lettuce with a bread crisp- no Parmesan cheese and the dressing was a lemon one (which in my book, doesn't make it a Cesar salad then!). The service continued to go downhill during the meal- ending in our waiter brusquely asking if ""we're done with our salads"", when we each had half our plates full. No polite asking if we were ""still enjoying our food"", or if we wanted to wrap it up.  Nor were we asked if we would like anything else, like coffee or dessert- pretty basic questions servers typically request at the end of a meal, especially at a nicer establishment.  It was obvious he just wanted his shift to end.  Considering we had been excited when we sat down, we, unfortunately, left disappointed and upset with the terrible experience.  I have no desire to return here."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Fantastic seafood and one of the best views in town. This place has a great patio and bar. Sit upstairs for sure. Generous pours and super delish plates.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Have eaten lunch here a few times and tried different dishes each time.  Truly enjoyed each dish.  Food, service are great.  Most recently had Carly as waiter.  She was friendly, prompt and overall did a great job!! We will be back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Went to the Bluewater Grill on a Saturday afternoon about 3:30 and ordered off the lunch menu.  I ordered the Lobster roll with hot butter and my wife ordered the Shrimp Louie salad.  Bread was very good, service was good.  Food was mediocre.  If you've ever had a Lobster Roll from the east coast or even from the Cousins Maine Lobster Truck, don't bother ordering it from Bluewater.  At $22, its a waste of money and lobster (although the lobster quality wasn't that good, chewy).  My wife didn't care much for her salad and felt it also was overpriced. Just great!!!   - -   another overpriced seafood restaurant in SB, when we needed a real good one.   Bluewater doesn't bring anything to the party."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Wonderful lunch experience! Sat at the bar upstairs - open air, ocean view, fresh fish, great service, really good menu, something for everyone and very well done! Fabulous ending to our Cali road trip!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great Clam Chowder and Salmon. Excellent service. Thanks for accommodating our large party of 40
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,We went there for my wife's birthday.  We both had the sand dabs.  Big mistake!  The breading had all fallen off and they were mushy.  They were supposed to be in a lemon caper sauce which was not noticeable at all.  We should have sent them back but we have a hard time doing that.  All in all a big flop.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Lure fish house and enterprise fish are my choices for happy hour. Convivo is not bad. Coming to blue water grill was at the suggestion of my son who yelped it. It's a good thing he did because I immediately fell in love with the ambience. The staff were friendly and the boss Colin made sure that we were at ease . I would highly recommend the place.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We started with delicious fresh sourdough bread accompanied by tasteful and refreshing cocktails right by the waterfront. Amazing waitstaff and everything was fresh and delicious. Would definitely come back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We ate in the bar to check out their happy hour menu 3pm-6pm Sunday. We had a great server who was also the bartender. We decided to try some of the happy hour items, all which were good and fairly priced. We got the chowder, which was good, although not my favorite. We
Also got the Lobster Roll, which is like a lobster
Sand which. It is on a roll of bread with large pieces of the meat from the lobsters claw on it served topped with drawn butter, that is if you get it warm which I recommend, however you can order it cold and it will be served with mayo instead of butter, guess it's just a personal preference. It's on a good location right across from the ocean although it's difficult to find parking. This place is worth checking out if your in the mood for seafood and in SB."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I'd have to try this again to get a better feel. It was good, but missed on a few important items that I noted in my photos."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Margaritas were excellent! The hostess, Jasmine and Rika were informative and helpful. Guided us through the menu and shared their favorites. The view and ambiance were fantastic."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Pretty sad dinner. Cold entrees that sat waiting for expediting too long. Over cooked trout that was nearly dust by the time it reached us. And the late potatoes that also arrived cold and greasy. This service In a restaurant that was not busy is a problem. 

I saw the great reviews and was hoping it would be good. Not even close."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Nice location.  Good venue.  Decent food.  Good service.  Jordan and Andrew were tops as our servers.  We were in two nights in a row and enjoyed the food and drink both nights.  I wish they had a juicy filet on the menu though.  The fish was pretty well prepared and the home made chips are addictive.  All and all it's a good spot at the pier end of State Street.  Recommended.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Compared to the Temecula location, this one disappoints.  Surprised by this? Me too...considering it has an ocean view, we were taken aback. Service was weak especially during lunch much rush on the rooftop...and food was mediocre(fish tacos were good...the fish platter was soooo greasy!). Not sure I'd return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What a great spot!  The views are spectacular from the 2nd floor patio.  The staff were totally together, providing great service, and the food was excellent.  The crab cakes were solid crab, tender and delicious.  Oh, try the lava cake... and the mojito. I can't wait to go back sample other menu items.  A great addition to the Santa Barbara restaurant scene."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Some of my friends and I stopped by the Bluewater Grill for a few drinks and some dessert. The atmosphere is definitely beach chic, not too fancy but not too casual. The mud pie was good but the chocolate volcano desert was even better! The service was amazing and I would definitely recommend going on a nice day where you can look out over to the ocean upstairs!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I wasn't that impressed with this place.  We took our friend there for lunch.  Got a bunch of seafood.  We got the sea urchin, calamari, seafood plate (oysters, scallops, shrimp), clam chowder and clams & mussels.  We also got a couple drinks. Service was adequate.  Sea urchin was just aite, but it was not the sweetest like santa barbara sea urchin usually is... the calamari was ok, it was a little oily and not crispy enough for me.  Seafood platter was ok, the scallops were good but the oysters didnt come with anything.  Usually when served raw oysters you get lemon, hot sauce, or something to dress the oyster but here you got nothing but the oyster.  We couldn't flag someone down fast enough to ask for condiments for oysters so friends just ate it since there were only a few and we were sitting outside so didnt want them sitting out in the sun for long. Friend said clams and chowder were good.  Drinks were strong.  Overall, i don't think I'd return.  Or if i did it would only be for HH."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Food was good but worst service I ever had. Our server didn't even come to check on us once. We got our appetizer after our food. He didn't even bother to fill out our ice teas. 
Nice restaurant, good food and I hope they could hire better servers."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My wife and I wanted to try happy hour with our 4 out of town visitors, including an 8 and 11-year old. Had been looking forward to trying this new restaurant, and thought happy hour would be a good way to sample the place. But we were told that so-called ""happy hour"" was at the bar only. There were plenty of empty high-top tables available in the bar area, but were told we couldn't sit at any of them--that we had to sit AT THE BAR. They wanted the 6 of us to spread out and belly up to the bar, even the kids. Ridiculous! What kind of stupid policy is that? They were adamant, and I said bullshit, let's get out of here. They are morons. We went next door, to the FishHouse, were seated in a comfortable booth in the bar area and spent $120 on crab legs, calamari, oysters, pasta, shrimp and scallops, beer, a martini and great service by an extremely friendly and accommodating waiter. Didn't catch his name but the women thought he was very good-looking. I don't know if I'll ever bother going back to the Blue Water Grill. They need to shape up and treat people reasonably. The FishHouse, BoatHouse, Lure and Enterprise are all great seafood places. Go there. The Blue Water will only make you Blue."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Believe the only reason we ventured to this place was because of the decent Yelp reviews. It was a complete disappointment. The hostess seemed to be in a middle of a daydream and the whole sitting situation was a challenge. We asked to be reseated from a bar table to restaurant style table only for her to move us to another bar table...finally we got to sit down at a normal table. Mind you, they weren't busy so plenty of open tables. The bar chairs weren't very comfy. I ordered the paella as it is one of my favorite meals only to be severely disappointed. The first thing I noticed is that the rice didn't look like rice, maybe a rice that was ran through a grinder and resembled sort of couscous shape. The dish looked vibrant but it was severely over seasoned with salt and absolutely inedible. My husband had one of their burgers and he was happy with it. Will not be going back, just another over priced tourist trap with hit or miss food."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"about 10 of us. They made room for us.. very nice staff and the drinks were good. 

Everyone at the table had something different and I had a salad with some protein.. everyone was envious as the presentation and healthy benefits my entree had over there's was perfect. 

A pretty extensive menu but everything was so good and so worth the price we paid. We'll be back ."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Nice place! Everything we tried was very tasty, especially the scallops plate and seafood pasta. Staff is super friendly! We are definitely coming back"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Terrific lunch!
Four of us had lunch there on Saturday and were not disappointed. The fish and chips, crabcakes, fish tacos, and clam chowder were all outstanding. In addition, our server, Jasmine, was great. We will be going back there on a regular basis."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Update, stopped today for Happy Hour, totally different experience. We had Jasmine as waiter and she was awesome, attentive and friendly. We will come back just to see her. We had our eight year old granddaughter with us. Win, win, very kid friendly with an awesome menu. Hubby was delighted with his mussels and old fashioned we will be back and try happy hour again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This is a relatively new restaurant in the old Santa Barbara lighthouse with delightful seafood, great service, and a beautiful view of Stearns wharf. We highly recommend the following dishes: 
- Chipotle Blackened Redfish (5/5) red drum from the Gulf, chipotle dirty rice, sweet corn, avocado relish 
-  Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo (4/5) shrimp, chicken and andouille sausage with okra, onions, peppers+celery, flavored with sassafras leaf over rice."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The endless mimosas here are amazing! They have a yelp deal and that's always a bonus. We were seated promptly for brunch! The crab cakes are apparently amazing.

I had a salad and unfortunately it was not good. It had grilled veggies that were not cooked right and were cold and there was little to no flavor, so I just thoroughly enjoyed the bottomless mims... 

Our sons didn't eat much of their dishes, but I appreciated the layout they came in and the kids menus for them to enjoy. I can't recall what my husband had but I do remember he also enjoyed it a lot! 

Seafood was good and fresh, salad was not. Drinks were abundant!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Oh man,  the food is awesome here. We just rolled into town and wanted a great bowl of New England clam chowder. This place did not disappoint. The chowder was buttery, creamy and smooth. My bf had the cioppino and a sea urchin.He loved them both.  Wish I would have thought of taking a picture before devouring our food. Jasmine, she's the best, customized  a drink for me. I was a happy camper."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We enjoyed an amazing complimentary dinner tonight at Bluewater Grill which served as a training for the new staff and kitchen. Seeing that it was a training night we were prepared to wait and for glitches here and there, but surprisingly, things went remarkably well! 

Since the restaurant was packed before we arrived we were offered the option to wait for a table or sit at the bar. We had no problem sitting at the bar and were seated immediately. By ""the bar,"" we were actually seated around the open kitchen and had the pleasure of watching all the action! We got to see so many amazing entrees get prepared and served. We loved the show!

Because of the training, we pulled entree options out of a bowl, instead of ordering from the menu but our server was very accommodating if we pulled an option we didn't want.  We all picked our free entrees and also got one free appetizer. In addition we were offered a free bowl of clam chowder!! This was a HUGE meal!! 

The entrees did take quite a long time to arrive, but our server was extremely attentive and made sure we had enough warm sourdough bread, Cocktails  and clam chowder. Not to mention, the ambience in the restaurant was amazing!! By the time our food arrived it hardly felt like a long wait. I'm confident once the staff finds their bearings they'll run like a well-oiled machine. 

Our favorites were the half and half clam chowder, the chicken and shrimp gumbo, the swordfish and the scalloped potatoes. We also really enjoyed the mai tais!  

We're looking forward to returning for happy hour on their upstairs patio overlooking the ocean!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place is so AWESOME!  Great ambiance, amazing service, and depending on your table a great view!  We loved the manager, Jerry Bravo, had a great conversation with him one night about his roots on Catalina Island and his new found love for Santa Barbara, a super cool guy!  This new restaurant is going to rock it with Jerry and his team!  That's saying something coming from a native Santa Barbarian who loves to eat and drink!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I took my wife here for dinner on our weekend away. @ 7:15 PM the wait was over an hour for 2. We were told if we could find a seat at the bar they served a full menu.  We found a seat in front of the bartender. It took over 15 minutes to get us a glass of water and a drink, another 15 mins for the bartender to take our orders and 20 + minutes to get the first course of  clam chowder and salad.  The temperature in the restaurant was at least 78, very uncomfortable. The Mahi Mahi I ordered was overcooked, the spaghetti squash the same. We eat out at least once a week in nicer restaurants and there is no good reason for service and fare this bad."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We have been here 5 times now since they've opened. Born and raised in SB, there have been many places that have come and gone, Blue Water is a welcome addition to the wonderful Fish Houses in SB. In fact, it has quick risen to my favorite. The range of dishes hey have, the flavors, service and ambience are all great. So far we've had the Alaskan Halibut, (now more than once, it's that good, fresh and sauces were delicious). Bacon, cilantro scallop appetizer was delicious but not much food for the price. Good enough to try once. Did not love the Caesar salad, I'd say pass on that one. The two pasta dishes we tried were very filling, full of flavor and one more heavy than the other. Our favorite was the squid ink pasta with burrata mozzarella!! Their bar has a strong pour, but I recommend a little known fact- grab a bottle of your favorite wine in the funk zone and cork your first bottle for FREE. And then only $10 for each bottle thereafter. Also, if you ever get the chance, try to get a reservation for the outside balcony overlooking the ocean. So gorgeous and a perfect way to end the day or enjoy a wonderful after afternoon in Santa Barbara. Enjoy!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Hubs and I were on our last night of vacation and spent it in Santa Barbara. We were walking along the pier trying to decide where to eat dinner and opted for Bluewater Grill that was across the street.

I am so glad we did. It is a very nice, quiet, cozy place where you can get a great meal. The hubs had Panko crusted shrimp and I had the Gemilli pasta with shrimp and scallops. My husband enjoyed his shrimp but we both said that my pasta dish was to die for and he wished he had ordered it!! LOL!

They even serve oyster 'shooters' so of course the hubs had to try one that included ghost chili of some sort. He liked it. Claimed it wasn't hot at all. ~ Laura"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Very nice servers and staff. The food was very greasy for non- fried items. Veggies, rice and fish left grease all over the plate. Bread cut the roof of my mouth because it wa so hard on the crust, asked for a different batch and it did the same thing. That could have just been an off bakery day. My BF liked the flavor of the swordfish and the food but agreed it was really oily. If you're good with that,  then the staff and ambience make it worth the visit. I'm just picky about the grease thing."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Meh. Went with my 4yo for a vacation pre-fathers day dinner. My son's salmon had black pepper on top, which is not what most any kid likes to eat. No one asked how the meal was. My kid and I love clam chowder and calamari. Fried calamari was average, kind of soft and mushy. Clam chowder was just OK. The hosts were very nice and kind. The waiter was kind of aloof."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We liked everything we ordered here. The scallop shooters were amazing! We were with a large group and stuck to the appetizers and items that were good for sharing. The location is fantastic but you will need to get there early to get an upper level spot with a view.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great place! We had a lovely dinner here! Great service, nice fresh fish with delicious sides & tasty beet salad. We got really lucky,they had an awesome guitarist/singer he performs every Tuesday night..we really enjoyed his music! We will most definitely come back to this great place‼"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Came here for valentine's day for the first time! The food was really good and the service was quick. I ordered the snapper fish with vegetables and fries. The vegetables and fries were good. The fish was okay. My server didn't ask if I wanted it seasoned so it was plain. We also tried the roasted fish of the day which was delicious! I will be getting that next time. Highly recommend the roasted fish!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Well this is a great restaurant as far as location and view from upstairs outside balcony seating. We decided to enjoy and try drinks with a bite to eat. Easy seating as not to busy, then yes waited almost 10 minutes to be asked if we wanted drinks. Ordered and waited over 10 minutes for drinks to arrive. My husband ordered Bloody Mary which said on menu (comes with olive, shrimp, spicy pickles green beans. Drink arrived with no garnish at all. Got waiters attention and he responded oh that's to bad , silence, then oh do you want me to get you the garnish?  After this experience decided to enjoy atmosphere, drinks, but not take a chance on ordering food as we were hungry and did not want to wait a long time, decided to take our business elsewhere. On the way out happened to pass manager and he asked how we enjoyed things. We told him upstairs was pleasant and enjoyed drinks and view but service was off and we decided not to risk ordering food. To his credit he was responsive gave us his card and said to come back, give them another try, ask for him. I give him the 3 stars and will try again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"It was a wonderful restaurant. One of us iceburg lettuce and loved it. Then came a fabulous collection of raw oysters perfectly prepared. After that was has the best raw scallops that would make a premiere sushi chef try and copy. One had the salmon that said it was cooked incredibly well.  My prawns were large and beautiful.  One  of us had the shrimp and chicken gumbo that he loved.  Last was the mahi mahi that was superlative.  I can not say enough good things about this great good fun restrurant, except the owners should open one in Seattle."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Both times been here sat upstairs for a meal on patio and very poor service.  Response to things like  - a little more dressing on the salad, etc took too long and  salad finished.  Brought wrong side dishes, etc.  food is just ok, not great.  Even visited another location with friends.  Slow service and mediocre food there too. Skip this place."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The Bluewater Grill was excellent and the boys upstairs at the bar took great care of my local friends and my visiting self. We ordered a wealth of calamari and green salad and seared tuna. To drink, I indulged in a spicy margarita with Casamigos tequila.  Of course, like clockwork, I spilled the spicy margarita on my lap about five minutes into our experience. The bartender graciously made me a new drink and I, although spicy in places that you've never imagined, enjoy the rest of my night drinking like a fish and eating fish too LOL"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,definitely one of the best sea food locations in santa barbara! the location is absolutely beautiful. i got the mary's chicken under a brick and it was cooked to perfection. the chicken itself was a large amount and came with really good sized portions for the price. also had the calamari which was some of the best that my mouth has ever come into contact with. also our bartender chris makes the best drinks around! i'd definitely recommended the serrano margarita! thank you also to ricardo and megyn for making this such a pleasant experience! definitely will be coming back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Very excited to have the Bluewater Grill in Santa Barbara. I've been to the one in Newport Beach many times, and always loved the ambience and food. The Santa Barbara location has an amazing view from the second floor. Two separate bar areas. And great food as well. Even though Santa Barbara is a coastal fishing town, they really were lacking in a great seafood restaurant. The Bluewater definitely fills this void."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Delicious food with views of the ocean off the balcony. I visited this restaurant twice and enjoyed my meal both times. Recently, I had this delicious shrimp and scallops pasta off the dinner menu. Let me tell you.... delicious. Thinking about making the drive all the back to Santa Barbara just for another plate lol. Service and ambience were also on point."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My mom and I came here for lunch today excited to try this new place as we are both from Santa Barbara. Unfortunately, when we were seated, we were not attended to by a server for almost 15 minutes, someone came by and gave us bread but no water to drink. Finally, the server came, took our order quickly and walked away without asking what we want to drink. My mom ordered the Bluewater burger and I ordered the Mahi Mahi sandwhich. My sandwhich came out first, and we waited about 10 minutes for the burger. Never got checked up on once to ask how the food was or a refill on water. As far as the food, the mahi mahi was very unseasoned and the Bluewater burger, unless you have a mouth that opens five inches you might enjoy it but had to be eaten with a knife and fork. Food was just okay but the service was terrible. Super disappointing considering it wasn't that busy. Would rather go to Nikka Fish market and grill, plates are fresh and prices are reasonable. Will not be coming back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had a fantastic experience with our party of 8. Excellent food, drinks and very attentive service all around in probably the best location downtown. Surprisingly good value, all things considered, and excited to go back on our next trip through."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had drinks at the bar on October 17. The bartender, Chris greeted us right away with a smile. The drinks were very good an we had a great view of the marina. We are so glad we had a great experience since it was our anniversary. We did not get any food, but look forward to going back soon for dinner."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The view from the upper floor, the beer on tap and the sourdough bread were the only stars for this new SB prime tourist spot. The service and food mediocre at best. The tiny calamari was overbreaded and barely room temperature. The fish portion in the fish and chips wasn't enough for a child, while the coleslaw was dry and undressed. Everything was less than satisfying and disappointing. Don't waste your money!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Another Santa Barbara restaurant week choice that did not disappoint!! We ended up ordering off the regular menu because the choices were too enticing to pass up. Also the corkage is free for your first bottle - that's a bonus
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had a very enjoyable dinner at the Bluewater Grill. Our server Sean was on point and the food was delicious. We started with the crab cakes and had the Alaskan Crab legs. 5 stars for this place, good atmosphere, service, and food."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Cute space with a boring menu. The drinks were about average and the menu straight out of Applebee's. The upstairs bar area did have an okay view of the water but nothing to call home for.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"They have an amazing brunch. That alone is worth eating there. Great views, good service, fair prices (brunch) and great food!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We are SB locals, and we had the best date night here. Starting with our server Andrew, this young man knows what he is doing and has a great attitude (not to mention a former Don). His manager Kevin, came by a few times and checked in on us, made us feel welcomed. We had appetizers all night and everything was A++, tasted great and fresh. Drinks +++. We will be back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We have eaten here twice in the last month or so and have really enjoyed the food, ambiance, and service. The sashimi style scallops appetizer is not to be missed, and the chowders are excellent. Watch out for the warm fresh bread they bring out, which is so good you risk filling up before the Main Event. Fresh fish options have been great -- I've had swordfish and salmon on my two visits. And the view from the upstairs bar and dining area is one of the best in town. Seems a bit pricey but it's a primo location and you gotta pay the rent, right!?"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Came with the family on a Friday for a lunch and while the ambiance was amazing, the food wasn't on par. 

Service-wise, while we did have to wait for the hostess to come back down to seat us (the hostess went upstairs to seat someone else so we had to wait for her to come back down), our server was very courtesy. We ended up being seated on the balcony facing the pier. To be honest, it is a bit cramped for the server to move around and if you ordered a lot of food like us, you'll have a bit of difficulty fitting all the food on the table. Perhaps fitting too many seating in too small of a space.

Food-wise, we ordered a bowl of clam chowder, San Francisco Cioppino, seafood paella valenciana, oysters on the half shell, and combo pot of clams & mussels. The meal comes with sourdough bread as well, which didn't taste like sourdough, but just regular bread.

I personally liked the oysters on the half shell - they were very fresh tasting and succulent. Not bad and wouldn't mind having them again. To be noted, the oysters are seasonal. The next best is a split between the paella and Cioppino. A decent amount of seafood and ingredients are used in either dish and the flavors aren't bad themselves. The bad thing with the paella was that the rice wasn't cooked on the pan itself. It was cooked and then scooped onto the pan, because the rice wasn't stick onto the pan itself to create the 'burned' bottom effect. A common bad thing with the paella and Cioppino are the quality of seafood. The seafood didn't taste fresh, but a bit frozen. Alarming to me since it's a seafood restaurant. The Cioppino was flavorful, but to each their own, my brother said he would have preferred it to be slightly more acidic. What erred me a slightly was the two half scallop shells used to decorate the dish (they were purely there for decorations and didn't contain a scallop on them) and the quality of the seafood used. 

The combo pot of mussels and clams wasn't terrible, but also not anything spectacular. Perhaps just not in the season? The combo pot of mussels and clams had a decent amount, but the seafood meat themselves were very tiny and not fresh tasting. Again, not what I was expecting for a seafood restaurant by the pier. The soup base did taste strongly of butter and white wine (reduced), but garlic was a bit non-existent. 

The clam chowder did have noticeable pieces of celery, clams, and potatoes. However, not much of a clam taste to it and tasted stronger of creme and flour. Not recommended unfortunately.

Overall, I would recommend the restaurant for ambiance if you can get the balcony seating (and it's nice weather) or downstairs by the windows. For food, I would be slightly iffy about that. Maybe it's the items I got, but I kind of doubt that. 

Side-notes: we ended up not asking for spoons, but we thought perhaps they should have offered them from the get-go? Service is kind of hard to get at the balcony seating so sit with caution."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We want to get some uni but I guess we are too late when we get to the place, they sold out. Other than that all good, nice service. The pasta taste good and there are plenty of seafood in it. There are lots of veggies with the fish which me and my friend likes a lot."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Explored State Street and walked the Sunday art show. Looking for a little snack ....

The Bluewater Grill looked inviting. Gorgeous exterior and interior. We headed up the stairs and found open seating at the bar. Watched replays of major sporting events today - a bonus!

Many lovely wines by the glass. Paired with half a dozen oysters and the crab cakes. Everything was fresh, beautiful and inviting. Service was friendly and attentive. View to the ocean was a beautiful bonus.

Learned that this new restaurant is part of the Bluewater Group that includes a favorite of ours in Newport. Of course! Quality seafood in wonderful settings with warm service. Consistent.

This is a gorgeous venue with quality food. Highly recommend and we will definitely return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Hooray, this is exactly what the waterfront needed - a modern, casual but hip mostly seafood restaurant with an extensive menu. Only open for 2 weeks but has clearly been discovered and was packed (reservations only accepted for groups of 6+). We skipped the 40 minute wait and went upstairs where we found seats at the second bar with spectacular pier and ocean views. I used to be leery of chains but, like the Honor Bar and Lure, they have got their act together and know what they are doing right out of the gate. Love the U-shaped bars with comfy bar stools, outdoor terrace with ocean view, extensive tap beer selection and the best fish and chips I've ever had - generous pieces of super fresh fish with a light batter. Compared to Lure and Brophy Bros, this blows them out of the water. Looking forward to trying their Happy Hour and lunch."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Really enjoyed Bluewater Grill. Beautiful view of the pier our first night in Santa Barbara. The seafood was super fresh and very delicious. The server was great and we enjoyed the whole experience. Definitely would go back again! For Santa Barbara this is a very reasonably priced restaurant.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came here for a birthday a few months ago, 6 adults and 2 kids. Food was excellent! I had the burger, but tried some of my groups entrees as well. Kids items were large portions, and served in a ""bento"" box style, worth the money if your kids eat their food. We came on a Monday on a really cold night, not sure if they cut a server since they thought it would be slow, but service seemed a little slow for the price you pay. Our waitress did a great job though, but was absent for long periods of time, maybe she had too many tables? All around a very nice place, friendly staff, and food was great. I would like to come back on a date with my wife soon"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We visited on Mother's day May 2019 with my husband and his 93 year old mother. We had brought a bottle of champagne which they served and waived the corkage fee (Mother's day, ancient Mother). The food was excellent. I had the halibut and my husband had a shellfish bucket. Everyone was really nice and accommodating. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars on this visit is that they had run out of 5 or 6 items on the menu. But I would definitely return. The location across the street from the beach, the great staff, and the excellent food at reasonable prices make it a fine place to dine."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Solid seafood and great location. The service was attentive but not hurried. Fair price for Santa Barbara.  I would definitely return
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,The oysters are good and the ambiance is great but each time I have gone we waited over an hour. Our waiter always walks by multiple times without checking in or replenishing our drinks. I really want to like this place so badly. It has so much potential but they just keep missing the mark. I hope they can work out the kinks. I'd like to give it another try. We live in town and would love a good go to oyster place near funk zone.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,One of the best views in Santa Barbara and Ricardo is the best!! Would highly recommend for a sunset cocktail
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Very attractive multi-layer design shows a lot of thought and experience that went into the decor.  The energy is definitely upbeat.  I had the rainbow trout that comes with three dipping sauces.  I asked for a small portion of all three and it was a good idea.  They were all completely different and all good in their own way.  The trout also comes almandine. I had cole slaw and seasonal vegetables on the side.  Everything was perfect. The chilled seafood platter was beautiful and really great.  Totally enjoyable meal.  The service must be getting better because ours was perfect, with the waitress knowing everything about the food, presenting it all in a very friendly and patient way.  I am sure that the wait staff are mostly excellent, but if you have a chance to enjoy Brittney as your waitress, you will agree that she is state of the art.  I will return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,I like the place a lot and it's a nice new addition to the downtown beach area. I had heard of it but they have a great Axxess deal which got us in the door. We've been back many times now and the service and food is really good.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I stopped by this restaurant out of pure convenience when I visited my sister at UCSB and were out at the beach. 

I can't really recollect any memory of the food I ordered EXCEPT for the bread lol that sh*t hit the spot to say the very least. 

I also remember how amazing our waitress/possibly bartender was. I'd never really dabbled in ordering wine, and she was seriously great in helping me out. 

Overall, as I am looking back, I did enjoy my dining experience and the memory I have is a good one and will come back if I'm ever in SB"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The ambiance is amazing in the evening. The staff was very nice. The reason for minus two stars was the food and drinks. It was just so... bland. Dining with 4 other people, who all ordered different things and we found each to be under seasoned. We took turns passing around the salt and pepper and seasoning everything on the plate."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Back again for another great lunch on the sunny patio for some much needed relaxation and delicious seafood with my man. Some of the best views in SB! Needed to recognize our great waitress Katherine. She was incredibly friendly and genuinely cared the we and the other guests around us were enjoying our food and had everything we needed. Nothing like service with a smile overlooking the ocean! Katherine was definitely one of the best servers we've had over our many, many visits here. She's a keeper!

Also love that there was live music when we came for happy hour the week before. Keep it up Bluewater, we love you!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The ambiance is great! The space is beautiful and in one of the best locations in Santa Barbara, with a great view overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Stearns Wharf. Although the views aren't visible in the downstairs bar area.

The service was friendly and attentive.

The happy hour menu is decently priced with a number of good options, although the drink specials are very limited to beer, the house wine, and simple well drinks.

The food was fine, but nothing special. Fairly small portions as well. The calamari was diluted with breaded red peppers and the fries were definitely not heaping."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I genuinely like this restaurant near Stearn's Wharf. It has a nice, spacious atmosphere with views in some spots. Genuinely good quality food and service. Just wish the menu was a bit more varied."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We were visiting Santa Barbara from Chicago for the first time and tried this restaurant. We ate upstairs and had a gorgeous view and fabulous service by a waiter named Jordan.  We had a delicious dinner, my husband had chipotle halibut and I had cedar plank salmon. Our waiter Jordan was outstanding. He was knowledgeable and friendly and made the experience very enjoyable. The manager this night was visible and stopped by to ask how our meal was. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a beautiful view, great service, and a delicious meal."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Don't get lured in here. Service is poor and food is worse. You can do as well at the tourist places on the Wharf.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I really like this place, but the last time I was there in the middle of the afternoon, and the service was *very* sub par. Plus I was excited to see Lava Cake on the menu for dessert, and ordered it... Very disappointing. Just plain chocolate cake, with NO LAVA inside at all."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"2/13/20 was my 6 th visit with cousins visiting from the East Coast. The food and service were flawless as always and our server Dani gave us the time we needed to chat -LOVE BLUEWATER GRILL !!! 

Wow my 5th visit and the best food I have had in Santa Barbara in 18 years! REALLY! Blackened ahi and blackened swordfish- our waiter Chris was great and I just learned that the chef is a woman - Chanel and she is so talented and as always the Manager, Colin, makes everyone feel so welcomed and appreciated THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Went here for an early Valentine's day dinner - got the scallops, oysters, branzino, cauliflower, lava cake and Serrano margaritas. Had an excellent server, really enjoyed ourselves!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great place to dine near the water front. Friendly staff and great service. Enjoyed the open kitchen.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Really disappointed. Service Was lackluster. The lobster roll was underwhelming and the oysters were tasteless.  Clam chowder was good but could have used pernod. Beautiful location,  great patio. It should do well with tourists but as a local I would not return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Jasmine was so great! I'm a server myself so I notice a lot of things that non-servers don't and she checked off all the boxes. She seemed kind of busy with all of her tables but was very attentive. Took away plates, remembered food & drinks (with substitutions) w/o writing anything down (which is still super hard for me to do!). If I'm ever back in Santa Barbara I will be coming back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great view and awesome seafood. I loved the selection of craft cocktails! I was disappointed in the wine list and they didn't offer many local wines by the glass.
The food was great. I got the shrimp and scallops skewers and it was delicious. 
Service was top notch! We had a large party celebrating a birthday and the staff handled our big party perfectly!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Spectacular place with mouth watering food... Seafood Gumbo. What truly sets this place apart from the rest of the staff especially Justin and Josh. Hearts of gold who will make sure you walk away with a smile on your face for the rest of the day!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great place to grab brunch with a great view.  This place never disappoints.  This is a fun place for a date or a get together with friends.  The prices are great, food selection is delicious and the staff has always been friendly.  If you are in Santa Barbara, make this a stop."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,This was such a disappointing experience. Date night was ruined. The server never came to the table and the assistant server/ busser took our order. The drinks took forever to get to the table. I was so disappointed and to top it off when we were sitting outside the broken down all the patio furniture and left us out there like we didn't exist. All the staff was messing around and texting behind the bar while we waiting over 20 minutes just to get the bill so we could leave. Don't go here!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Amazing view , great service & food was on point... thank you blue water grill for finally coming to the Santa Barbara! oh, and thank you Tanya for recommending the Swordfish.. was delicious ,and your margarita was amazing ."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Very disappointed with the service. My husband and I were here out of town celebrating our anniversary in Santa Barbara. Busy spot so we wait our turn to get a table. Our server Taylor (female blonde)maybe takes about 10 minutes to grab our drink orders. By that time we have our appetizer and entree orders set. *cricket cricket* 45 minutes pass and we have yet to receive our food. At this point the restaurant is close to closing time. The only positive experience from this was the manager Colin. He was apologetic but Taylor. Hellooo where's Taylor??
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My wife, daughter and I walked here from the Hilton on their recommendation for an early dinner. We all had the chowder. I had the 50/50. Very good chowder! We also had the calamari, seafood Louie, muscles with chorizo and key lime pie. All very good. Jazmine was great and made sure we were well taken care of."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The Oyster Shot with Ghost Chili Vodka is a must try, I will go back for this alone as it has some excellent kick. My kiddo was a fan of the Shark Attack. (Main course was okay but it could have been an off day.) Service was excellent and view of ocean to match!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Best Restaurant ever amazing service food was reasonably priced the steamed clams and mussels were amazing happy hour was unbelievable huge portions super good healthy food made all right there sourdough bread was delicious.
best Mai Tai since my time in Hawaii
Can't wait to go back to this place next time I'm in Santa Barbara highly recommend it!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Poor service and mediocre food. The Manhattan chowder is the best thing we ordered. As a group of 6 people who also ordered appetizers, nobody was impressed with the food or experience. Find a better place nearby. You can thank us later."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Great views from the upstairs bar, a rarity in SB. Mostly visiting at lunch, today the sole appealed. But the kitchen consistently disappoints. The chef has never been to Seattle, nor NYC? The sole comes rolled up in a ball? Like, where did they find this recipe? Not a one-off, though, I'm disappointed again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We had a great lunch at the Bluewater Grill our waitress Jasmine was right on the ball everything was excellent presentation was good. We all had a   Awesome time.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The fresh fish selections are good and the drinks are terrific.  Service is so-so.  It took 20 minutes for us to receive drinks after they were ordered (server did not hear my order, although he acknowledged it when I gave it).  Halibut was very overcooked."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Been here for lunch and have also had happy hour. Andrew the bartender and Carly the server were great and so much fun! I'll be eating here again, thank you!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Loved sitting at the 2nd floor bar and looking out at the wharf - what an amazing spot!  Plenty of servers and the beet salad was amazing and the artichoke/crab dip was a super delicious choice as well for a happy hour appetizer. Very friendly service, only could've been better if they looked to our end of the bar; I still highly recommend this place. Delish. And gorgeous decor as well."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Setting and service excellent. Linguini and clams wayyyyy too salty. Clam chowder delicious. Oysters generous size and delicious
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Went last week to this spot. I never heard of it before.  Wish I heard about it sooner. They were so accommodating,  very tentative,  nice, food was delicious.  Some may say pricey, I say well worth it. Everything was great!! I loved how it was family owned.  We will be back again and again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Today we experienced excellent service from Collin, the manager of Blue Water Grill and our server, Dani.  My husband Albe , our son James and his fiancée,Robin wanted to try their Happy Hour for the first time and we didn't get disappointed. We ordered their Calamari, Fish Bites, Artichoke Crab Dip with chips; House Salad and Edamame ( all were tasty). Service was fast. When Collin learned that we are locals , he sent us a complimentary plate of Calamari. They also offer good quality beer and wine. We highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What an awesome little spot in Santa B. Sat down for a wonderful lunch - their fish is great, drinks are even better!

We're definitely coming back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"First off this is the best view in Santa Barbra.

AmaZing food and vibe.. Sam my waitress was so polite and attentive. Blue water got a good catch with her!!

Colin the GM was very helpful and took great care of us .

Good lunch, Good View. Go!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I have dined at Bluewater Grill on several occasions and have had a lovely experience each time. The restaurant itself has a beautiful aesthetic, and you cannot beat the ocean view- especially at sunset! Whether you are in the mood for a craft cocktail and appetizers (Amber makes a great SBGT, and I highly recommend the Fire Cracker Shrimp, Spicy Edamame, and Ponzu Sashimi Sea Scallops) or keen on a full dinner service, this is my go-to spot in town to enjoy with friends. Not to mention, the staff is always so courteous and kind! Both managers, Dallas and Colin are always very attentive and go out of their way to make sure you feel welcome and Aldo is a top-notch lad."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Excellent reception and food!
Beautiful view and decor.
Ambience was calm and comfortable.
Dirty tables and floors.
Our waiter was dry and not friendly and did not seem happy to be there.
Took more than 30 minutes for soup and salad to arrive. Too long.  
Delicious food!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Bluewater Grill is one of my favorite places in Santa Barbara for a great view and to enjoy fantastic seafood. Richie at the bar upstairs is hands-down One of the best bartenders.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great location down by the water with views of the ocean. Food was good and service was as well. It's a four out of five star type restaurant. You will be happy with it but it won't blow you away. A real solid place, very nice inside, and good service. I would go back again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Five reasons why we will go back. We got there early and got to park for free right behind the restaurant, reason #1. The restaurant is so pretty and clean, great atmosphere for romantic, family or just friends, #2. Staff were helpful and friendly, #3. All our food was very tasty and looked so pretty, #4."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came here for dinner. The person helping us, Richie, was spot on. Chowder was darn good. Service was impeccable. Glad we came!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Food was really good and hot! Our dessert was a key lime pie that was....well pretty bad...so don't order that. The waiter told us his favorite dessert and we should have listened. Service was a little slow, we wanted a Second round of cocktails but that time just never came...."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"It's always the pretty restaurants on the water that have terrible-less-than-mediocre seafood.  WHYYYYYY???!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?  Right across from the pier in Santa Barbara is Bluewater Grill- it's open, airy, with a cool vibe.  But the food is bleh.  It's a pick your fish and generic side dish kind of place, never good. 

Calamari- there wasn't that much calamari.  It was mostly filler aka piquillo peppers, very few pieces of calamari, and it was luke warm when it came out.  Octopus- over cooked and chewy. 

The crab cakes- I actually enjoyed these but not enough to go back.  All of the food that came out just didn't look very appetizing."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Had a business lunch with six other people. I had the crab BLT sandwich, and it was yummy. The crab was prepared like a crab salad, but without too much mayo. The homemade potato chips were like crack!

Everyone loves everything - the clam chowder, the fish tacos, the Caesar salad with shrimp. 

We were too full for dessert, so I can't attest to that. Lovely location right across from the beach.

Oh I almost forget! They starve fresh, raw Uni (sea urchin) from out of Santa Barbara's beautiful waters, and the bite I had of their lobster roll made me want to return tomorrow."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"In our trip to SB visited this place twice, that's how much we loved it! The atmosphere is both welcoming and relaxed with a very classy feel that makes you want to hang out. Our first visit was for a Friday HH, we had oysters, clam chowder and mussels, all delicious and generous portions. We tried a couple of their beers and wine (both HH and not). Service was friendly, attentive and aT no point did we feel rushed out, great evening!
We returned for Saturday brunch the next day. Sat upstairs which has 4 booths, a patio and gorgeous bar. There is this amazing ocean breeze throughout the place that's phenomenal. We had the crabs Benedict, absolutely perfect, melted in your mouth. We tried the Bloody Mary, not too spicy, just the right flavors. For brunch there is a current special buy one for $8, refills for $4 and you can also do bottomless mimosas for $15.
Service was again friendly and on point. 
The restaurant has a parking lot (we saw it walking to the place) which is nice considering the parking situation in the area. 
We are so happy to have found this place, excellent food quality and service. Will absolutely be coming back when in SB."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Had dinner here Friday night, July 6, night of the 7.1 earthquake in Ridgecrest, so it was a rocking and rolling evening to start things off!!!   We did the yelp check in and got some half priced drinks which were super great tasting and strong!  Food was also terrific!   Servers and bar were super busy yet very nice.   We had a great time, food was great, all around perfect and an awesome value to top it off!!!  And a view of the ocean came with it."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"If i could give a negative number i would. The service was AWFUL!!!! My boyfriend ordered a burger only
to be told later they didn't have anymore. So he had to order the steak. Then the table directly next to us ordered a burger. A little while later both got their orders. He got his steak and the lady next to us got the burger. REALLY???! Thought there wasn't anymore burgers? Oh and did i mention my boyfriend is a man of color and the lady next to us is was white. Hmmmmm go figure. We will NEVER return to the establishment. 10 thumbs down as far as I'm concerned."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We found this place by CHANCE... if your looking for a great seafood awesome view and environment I recommend this place.  Our server josh was surprisingly very attentive and anticipated our needs..   absolutely impressed with the food environment service and location..
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,This restaurant was highly recommended so we were very disappointed.  The sole amandine and the sea bass were extremely dry.  The crab artichoke dip starter was also very dense and dry.  Service was friendly but average.  Not returning.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Dissappointing.  We've been to several Bluewater Grill restaurants.  This one is not the same.  Things were left off the plate and the presentation was off.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Made reservations through yelp and got a table with a beautiful view! The servers and bartenders were delightful and held good conversation. Food was delicious, highly recommend the calamari and lobster Mac!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Oh my god!!! I went Tuesday and it was amazing!! Very good service, high quality food, well designed dishes, very tasty. The mahi mahi was mmm so good. Then I had the key lime pie and I died it was so tangy! Next time I want to sit on the third floor and watch the sun set."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Truly a 5 star restaurant by the beach in Santa Barbara. Went here for lunch with my hubby and 2 of our for lunch during a day trip to Santa Barbara. 

Everything was outstanding, the food, ambience, and the great service considering we had 2 toddlers. 

Their only fault was that they were out of burger buns, so they substituted with a brioche bun. We didn't care for it and didn't eat it, so they kindly removed it from our bill and gave us a free dessert which the boys loved."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Go there hands down the best seafood we have had in a very long time.  Jordan our waiter  was spot on very nice and a great smile.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This restaurant has it all from the location and ambiance, to the delicious fresh seafood and friendly staff. I highly recommended grabbing an appetizer and cocktail and watching the sunset here! It's the perfect date night spot or place to get together with your friends! You can't go wrong with their crispy calamari, ponzu scallops, or crab and artichoke dip as a starter. Their wine and cocktail menu is amazing (seriously check it out!) I have never been disappointed with any drinks that I've ordered from Chris, Triston,or Justin. I just wanted to say thank you to our awesome server Kat and the hands-on manager Dallas, you guys always go above and beyond to make my time at Bluewater a great one. This is the best restaurant in Santa Barbara!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place is upping their game and you cant deny it. I remember going in when they first opened and thinking they were a work in progress. I've recently gone back and I'm amazed on how well they've grown. The service is definitely up to par with their exquisite food. The manager Ricardo greeted us at the door and accommodated us to a quiet corner per our request. Our server Sam was a delight! She was quick, kind and fully knowledgeable of their menu. Ricardo continuously checked up on us and made sure we were taken care of beyond our expectations. Menu was very pleasant- you pick your fish, your seasoning and your two sides. Easy peasy. The spicy edamame is my favorite. It has the right blend of zest and spice. Crab cakes are delicious and filling. Everything is grilled to perfection. I love this place for date night and family dinners. I will always be back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I have been to this restaurant three times and one star is one star too many. I sat at the bar every time and had happy hour once and dinner twice. I will not be back. They need to hire more staff at the bar because they always seem slammed. In any case, all three times the bar staff ignored me and the other guests I was with. We had to flag them down to order and pay and they did not check back for drink refills. I did, however, notice they were very attentive to a girl who was very drunk and still serving her shots. The food was mediocre. My fish was greasy and overcooked and my friend's burger had beets on it. Never heard of that food combination and it didn't seem to work. The last straw was that they charged me an additional $20 on top of the tip I already left. After two calls and 3 weeks, I have not received a credit for the overcharge."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great customer service and delicious food. Great ocean view. Try to go to second floor, nice view.
Recommended."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Ricardo the manager is amazing,  thank you chris for your amazing service tonight  , and how can I forget how great of a manager Dallas is as well. You guys make such a great team,  thank you. We enjoyed everything, the blue water grill burger with a over easy egg was very delicious. Thank you to the hostess Claire for seating us at the amazing rooftop bar, she was amazing and beautiful."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Service is good. Food is bland, so so. We had the ahi appetizer. Bland it needed something more. The sword fish came with coleslaw and potatoes both needed flavor. The swordfish was good  but all in all disappointing. Too many other good restaurants near by.... like toma's"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My husband and I made a reservation of his birthday dinner for last night. I called and made the reservation over the phone. When we showed up at 6:30pm, our reserved time, the restaurant was closed! You can imagine how disappointed we were since it was not just any birthday, it was his 60th, and we came to Santa Barbara as a special getaway. My husband loves seafood so he was really looking forward to eating here. Since the restaurant asked for my phone number when I made the reservation, they could have at least called to let us know that they would be closed."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great place for a upstairs patio for cocktails and food. Thank you Ricardo for amazing customer service and attention to detail. Chris makes an awesome Martini.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Wow best dining experience and taste of fresh fish we had in Santa Barbara !
They even have cute menus for kids and serve their meal in kids plates!
The service was amazing and everyone was super friendly!
We sat at the top patio and the view was mesmerizing"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The oysters were heavenly. The view from our outside, porch table was beautiful and our server was delightful. The Poke was delicious. We will definitely be back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My friends and I partook in the training dinner that they had before their grand opening.

The restaurant looks very nice from the inside and out, the restroom was also comfortable but there's only one per sex. For a restaurant this massive, I think I was lucky to get the restroom without waiting in line. Restaurant was packed at 7:00 when we came in.

We received dishes based by taking paper slips out of a hat, we got the Sirloin, Swordfish, Salmon, and a pasta I can't remember but it was Pesto and Shrimp.

We had Ahi Poke and Manhattan chowder for appetizers and both of these were delicious.

Sam our server, was very nice and attentive to our needs. All of the servers/bussers/hosts were very nice and enthusiastic. When I started as a waiter I was enthusiastic too, that was easy to forget after a few months, I hope they can keep it up.


It took a while to get our main dishes out and my friend's salmon came out much later than everyone else's. There were a few issues but I'll let her write that side of the review if she ever wants to. It was busy so it's understandable that the food took so long to get out.

My Sirloin Steak was medium like I ordered it to be and juicy along with the scallop potatoes and asparagus that came with it. I have no complaints here, would have preferred if I was given a steak knife instead of using my butter knife.

Overall a great experience at the restaurant The prices here are a bit on the higher side, I wouldn't mind coming here again but I'd have to be ready to spend a pretty penny.

Get one of their candies on the way out."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Came here for my moms birthday. we received the best service ever. They were a little busy so our food took a little long but we were treated so nicely and everyone seemed really professional.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Our server was nice, atmosphere was as well, overall the food was OK, the paella wasn't very good, plus they messed up on one of our sides. The highlight were the oyster appetizers. I ended up e-mailing them and the GM Colin replied.
He was extremely kind and offered us to drop by again, sadly we had other plans, he even reached out again to see if we had time, but we had to go at that point. It is always a great sign for me when someone in charge actually cares and  tries to make a difference. It's clear Colin is a solid guy.
I can say that overall it was A-OK (3 stars) and I know if we would have gone back I would be giving a 4-5 star review... We'll stop by next time we visit."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I absolutely love this place.  The food is great, especially the lobster roll and salmon sandwich.  I recommend going for lunch, sitting at the upstairs bar, and just taking in the beautiful ocean views and maybe striking up a conversation with the people sitting next to you.  The bartenders are super friendly and attentive.  This is one of my favorite places in Santa Barbara."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great food. Cute decor. Attentive staff. Had the crab and shrimp Louie salad with a cup of mixed chowder- my preference is New England but it was fun to be able to try both.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Jazmin recommended all our food and it was phennnomenallll! She is energetic sweet and knows her food!!!! We will be coming back. Thanks jazmin.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Brings back memories of Castagnolas great chowder and lobster Day was fabulous!! Generous drinks and very attentive staff ...
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Amazing! We just got into town on a Saturday night. Ran across this cool looking restaurant. It had complimentary valet. No wait. The lobster tail was delicious! It didn't even need to the drawn butter. But of course, I dipped it anyway. They split the plate for only$3, but when the server heard I didn't want but a course bites, she just brought me an extra plate for no charge. Complimentary Happy bday sundae for Mom. Everything was delicious!! Reasonably priced for a fish House, that offers so much more, right be the sea."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We had dinner here on Sunday night. One of the specials was a deep fried tender white fish that they deboned for me before bringing it to the table.  It was so delicious. The whole dinner experience was very nice. A bit pricey but totally worth it if you are have the means and are in the area. I highly recommend it.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Food was ok, not that great at all. My fiancé and I arrived at 8:20pm and they were closing at 9pm, so it was clear that they were in a hurry. The waiter was sweet, but she came over to inform us that the kitchen will be closing at 8:45pm, which alluded the fact that we had to hurry up and order, which was fine, but it really wasn't because of how it was told to us. Pretty much, we needed to order at that moment. 

The food was rushed and not fully cooked. My fish when I bit into it was super mushy (undercooked) and didn't have a taste - very bland. I had shrimp and fish; it tasted like nothing but oil (YUCK!) 

Unable to finish my meal because it wasn't tasty at all. Couldn't request it be sent back and I order something else because it was past 8:45pm. Smh. Not pleased with my experience at this restaurant. 

Disappointed with the food. Not good at all."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Amazing meal :) from the service to the food. We felt very well taken care of and given great recommendations on everything. KitKat was our server. She was so friendly. She checked on us just enough that we didn't have to worry about a thing. We will definitely be back
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We're staying in town for a wedding and decided to try this place last night. We were really happy with all the options on the menu (my husband is kind of a picky eater) and the ambience was really mellow. I had the pesto pasta with scallops and shrimp and my husband had a burger and we both loved our choices. Carly was our server and really on top of it and friendly. Try the key lime pie! I would totally go back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Food: delicious. Started with one of the wee salads which was great, but here's the thing, they're not exactly wee. They are larger than you'd expect so be aware. For my entree I had the swordfish which was absolutely awesome. It might have been my favorite dish in months and I really enjoyed several dishes on my left coast trip. Delicate, meaty, spicy, but not too spicy. Just awesome. Would get it again Tomorrow!

Service: good to go. Polite and attentive.

Atmosphere: comfortable, professional but casual ish. Right down the fairway for me."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I made a dinner reservation for our anniversary for my husband and toddler son a week specifying that we needed a high chair.  We arrived on time and were told that they only had bar top tables so could not accommodate a high chair.  The lady told me it will be a 15 min wait.  So we waited and when the table was cleared and we thought we were sitting down (my son was crying with hunger at this point) the very rude and unprofessional manager Colin told me that table was for another larger party they were seating.  At this point we had no idea how long the wait would be. My son needed to eat.  Colin was extremely inexperienced, very rude and uncaring.  He raised his voice to my husband when we informed him of our a week old reservation. The service is well below standard. I do not recommend."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I was super excited to get some good seafood during my trip go SB, but unfortunately Bluewater was a huge disappointment. If you're going there for a drink and to just hang out, it seems to be okay.  The restaurant itself is really pretty inside, great location, and has a beautiful view of the water! 

We came into Bluewater shortly after 9 PM on a Friday night. Being that the kitchen closed at 10, I didn't think we were cutting it too close. (I've been in the service industry for over 10 years so I know how it goes!) The host suggested/pushed quite a few times that we sit at the bar, which we declined being that my partner and I were on a date for DINNER.  Our waiter seemed to be slightly overwhelmed with the number of guests he was serving, so I felt as though he was rushing through our ordering process and my questions regarding ingredients due to my list of food allergies (and yes, they're legit). He was also very inattentive and slow to take our entree order which could have been the cause of our OVERLY lengthy stay at this place, not to mention it most likely caused the shortage in time taken to properly prepare the snapper that I ordered. First of all, it came out lukewarm at best- no big deal. When I cut into it, the middle was borderline raw with the outside and ends being overlooked. I showed our server (who didn't come back to check on us for a long time) and he said it seemed ""normal"" to him for red snapper, however I was uncomfortable eating it like that. Another employee assisted in the process of placing my fish onto a separate plate to take back to the kitchen. 10 minutes go by before she returned with THE SAME piece of fish I had cut up, and relayed a message from a cook who said ""tell her that it's cooked fine, it's almost too done..I should know because I'm the one who cooked it."" At this point, my fish was ice cold. It seemed as though it was a hard ""no"" from the kitchen in terms of preparing me a fresh piece, as this SAME piece has been toted all around the restaurant and back to my table. I ended up having to eat that same piece of rubbery, tasteless red snapper. It seemed to me as though the fish was frozen, quickly thawed for me, then thrown on the grill at high heat in order to rush it to me. I can't imagine how else it would have turned out so rubbery and inconsistent in texture and temperature. Our server did try to remedy the situation towards the end and seemed to be a little more empathetic.

My partner had a steak dish that was decent, but nothing extraordinary. She didn't finish about 80% of her meal, so they offered to box it up for her. In the midst of us trying to figure out the check, and just being frustrated, we got into our cab and realized that the staff never brought her leftover dinner back to the table after being taken away to be ""boxed up"". 

This place has potential, but it was NOT worth the $"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We had a wonderful visit to Bluewater Grill last week.   Service was generally good (one request for sauce was forgotten).  The food was delicious.   We started with the Calamari which was perfectly fried and seasoned.   We then had the New England Clam Chowder which was tasty with a decent amount of clams.   One of my sons got the crab cakes that were done quite well.    My other son got the fish and chips off the kids menu.  It was delivered nicely in a bento box type of plate which was fun for my son.    He also got a shark drink that he loved (sweet drink with gummy sharks).    My wife and I shared the clam chowder and a Fisherman's plate.   Everything on this plate was good quality and perfectly fried.   My littlest one also managed to leave a souvenir we had purchased on the warf and they found it and saved it for us.   We will definitely return to this restaurant the next time we are in Santa Barbara!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Absolutely loved it. So god service outstanding. We can't wait to go again!!! Best scallops and bread !!!!! Yummmm
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We had a delicious lunch at blue water Grill today. We started off with the crab and Artichoke dip with fresh tortillas chips which was delicious! We had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc to accompany it. For lunch we had the clam chowder soup and the lobster roll and both were delicious. Service was nice and friendly and we can't wait to come back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We went for brunch and the food, service and ambiance was amazing! Next time we want to go back for dinner."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Patio is the best view in the wharf, got lucky enough to get it twice. Loved the salads, the soup, the lobster--all of it! Most of all the view :)"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Had our wedding in Santa Barbara and needed a morning-after-wedding brunch spot in a pinch. 
Chanel from Bluewater Grill was amazing to work with and super accommodating of our large group. 

There were no outrageous fees like the ones we encountered trying to book other locations. 
And of course the food and views are incredible! 
Chanel let us customize our brunch menu and provided fruit and deviled egg platters upon arrival which were a big hit with all our hungry guests. 

Couldn't have asked for a more perfect way to end our wedding celebration!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Had such a fun time here! The food was so good and the service was friendly. I would definitely recommend this place!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Good clam chowder here and my lady had a wonderful order of fish and chips. Friendly and warm ambiance, very chill on a Tuesday afternoon. We brought our dog and they were kind enough to bring him a bowl of water. Checked-in and got half off our drinks plus waitstaff was very kind throughout.  Would eat here again if we find ourselves in Santa Barbara."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I visited the city from traveling from Sacramento, and upon my entrance I was told about an item I could buy which came with free refills. Upon my purchase an employee Joshua, was very rude and unfriendly towards me since I was only buying a drink felt that my priority as a customer came last so Joshua did not take my concern seriously when I returned as an unhappy customer from paying for my drink. So, I then spoke to the manager Dallas, and he too his time to listen to my complaint, he sympathized with me about my refills and completely turned everything around for me. Thank you SO much for your respect Dallas !!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"dallas is a great server.  took care of us outside and colin welcomed us with open arms.
first time great place"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"They didn't have what was on the menu. Side salad super underwhelming, no dressing. Sub-par service. Drinking glass was chipped and could have left a bad cut on my lip had I not noticed."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Six of us arrived without a lunch reservation and we were quickly accommodated. We didn't have a table with a view, but the restaurant is very nice, the wait staff were careful and efficient, the food was good, and the price was fair.

It was a good experience. We would go back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Disappointed, from the very beginning the hostess was rude. Our waiter Carlos seemed rushed and not attentive at all, my sons food was last to come out and and it took forever and asking twice to get our check. The food was okay nothing spectacular. For the price you'd expect better food and service."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary. The food, staff and ambiance​ were​ great! Very clean. They sat up in front of the window for a view. The owner came to check on us. Amazing experience​! We are coming back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a couple of days in beautiful Santa Barbara. At lunchtime we decided to try the Bluewater Grill. It was the right choice. We were shown upstairs to an open deck. My wife ordered the Shrimp Louie and it was awesome! I got the fish and chips. Also very good! We had a young man named Justin who was our waiter. He was very attentive and had a good personality! What I like in wait staff person. We will go back when we go back to Santa Barbara.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Absolutely disgusting. I've eaten at blue water grill's in other cities so I assumed there would be a standard for the food they serve. Boy was I wrong. The food was not fresh and was obviously pre packaged. We got the dip and discovered that there was mold on the bottom. We got sick (shocking!) and lost a night of our vacation. Avoid this place like the plague.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Had dinner here tonight with my mom and sister celebrating our birthdays. We sat at the bar and Dani took care of us. She is absolutely amazing and the food was great too! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone for the food and the service.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Neat space and really cute building. Plenty of fish plates available. The poke was quite fabulous. I just wish the fish tacos were available all the time!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Absolutely the best seafood you will ever eat. I love scallops and have my own signature preparation. I wasn't sure at all about the sashimi app but it was to die for. So delicious. Also had the seared scallops with jalapeño aoli. Absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked scallops and the sauce was not overwhelming. Highly recommend this place. Very nice servers and wonderful food.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This restaurant is so well located. We had dinner yesterday celebrating my birthday and the experience was awesome. Our table was in the patio upstairs with a wonderful view of the marina. Our appetizers and entrees were delicious. Service was really good. Chris, our server was knowledgeable of the menu and drinks and super attentive to our needs. A special thanks to Annia, the manager, who was always making sure we had what we needed. She went beyond any other manager from any restaurant usually does. She loves her job indeed! Overall, a great experience. Both culinary and entertaining. Will certainly go back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We've been wanting to try this place with the best location in Santa Barbara since it opened in the old Castagnola's restaurant on Cabrillo Blvd. So, the restaurant is gorgeous. We requested to be seated upstairs. The outside deck was full so we sat in the upstairs bar. The acoustics were terrible! It was so loud and every time this woman shrieked it was like a knife going through you! Not the fault of the restaurant, just poor acoustics.
That being said, the food was really, really good. The prices were within reason and service was okay too."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We're locals to Santa Barbara and know the good places to go. Our first time at the Bluewater Grill was awesome! Ricardo and the wait staff took really good care of us. The seafood was fresh and the cocktails were top shelf. We'll be back for more. Thanks again to the staff at the Bluewater Grill.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"A needed addition to Santa Barbara.  The food was amazing and the waiter was helpful and had solid recommendations (and stay away from.)

Will be back soon!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great food, good service, and nice views. The place is pricey, but you're paying for the location, right across from the beach. Food is good and portions are decent. My only complaint is that they took too long to clean the tables so there were dirty tables next to us while we were eating after other customers had left -- I don't really think there's an excuse for that, since it was not busy and they looked like they had more than enough staff."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Slow service, bland Caesar salad that took 30 min to arrive.  Bland scallops potatoes, seasoned vegetables and tuna.  No one at are table was that satisfied.  Maybe it was a bad night at the kitchen as our waiter did his best, but would not go back"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great Food! And Excellent Service!
We went to this restaurant and sat on the upstairs  patio.  Beautiful view!  My wife and I ordered the Blackened Salmon which was perfectly prepared!  I recommend ordering the Serrano Margarita, fresh and spicy!  The service was outstanding!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"It was a wonderful evening in Santa Barbara! The view was lovely, the food was delish, and our server Raya brought joy to every table she served. What a lovely meal!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Worst service in all of SB. 
Waiter was completely unresponsive and unwilling to take the order from four patrons. 
He literally kept leaving after each individual drink order so we had to place orders directly through the bar. 
Once he did take the food order apparently he threw it away as food was never delivered and an hour later he asked us if we even placed an order, then he changed his story and stated the order got bumped then he said the order came out and was sent back to the kitchen. 
SO many better options in SB, don't bother visiting this tourist trap. 
For extra horrible service, ask for Chris."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Very good food and excellent service. Taylor and Angel was wonderful and everyone so efficient.  We were party of 10 and everyone were accommodated. We had branzino and ahi and amazing Ceasar salad with anchovy which is so unusual and delicious. The setting and the view are just Wow!!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Walked in at 3:15pm, there were only 2 guests at the bar. We waited over 7 minutes while bartender made eye contact with us repeatedly but never offered to get us help or seat us. After a 3 hour drive we were starving and ready to try out this place, but after the terrible service we finally left and will never return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Bluewater Grill has been an awesome reprieve from the lock down for sure.  The wait is not long, the service is awesome, and the food is fantastic!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We visited this awesome spot on 8/21.  This was our first trip out since the pandemic began In March.  The staff all or face mask and the servers also wore face shields.  The seating and tables were spaced out by California safety guidelines.  We shared with our server Ahna that we had just got married and were celebrating our ""mini-moon"" since we couldn't go to Italy for our honeymoon.  She was super sweet and was happy to make our visit with them special.  We asked he for recommendations and she was very informative about the food and drink menu.  We ordered everything she suggested.

We ordered the ponzu scallops as our starter.  DELICIOUS!  I would recommend this highly. 

I ordered the USDA Prime Top Sirloin with mashed potatoes asparagus.  I ordered my steak medium rare.   My steak was cooked perfectly and was juicy with lots of flavor.  

My new husband ordered the Chipotle Blackened Swordfish.  I'm sure it was delicious because he ate everything on the plate before I had a chance to ask for taste.

We both had the captain mai tais as Ahna recommended.  We ended up ordering 5.  They were refreshing and smooth to drink. 

As a special surprise they gave us a complimentary desert.  We ordered the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  My husband is not a sweets guy and we both LOVED IT.  We happily finished it.  

Thank you again to Ahna and the rest of the staff at the Bluewater Grill for making our first dinner on our Mini-Moon so memorable and special."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Amazing happy hour.  Delicious cucumber mojito and and the grilled octopus over the top.  Also great service.  Will definitely be back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We were looking forward to and yet mildly apprehensive about this lunch: First time meeting the parents of Son2's girlfriend. He had put effort into making sure it was a great spot. Turns out, instead, it was a good spot.

The location is wonderful, on the beach, nicely appointed, roomy and not loud. And providing free customer parking (in back) in this area is a strong  ++.  On the other hand, we arrived together shortly after their listed opening time of 11:30 a.m. and inexplicably waited 10 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant. Literally inexplicable -- no one bothered to explain. 

Happily, once seated, servers were prompt, knowledgable and helpful. The food trended good. Mostly. Calamari Fritti was overcooked and relatively tough. Not bad, not good. The Crab&Artichoke dip was very good, as were the accompanying warm chips. We didn't order the Crab Cakes but when presented we were not going to object in front of our new, delightful friends (particularly given the possibility of longer-term connectivity ;). Turned out well as the Crab Cakes were very good, very crab-y.

Seafood Louie Salads were fresh, very good, and generous in the seafood servings. The Boston Clam Chowder was simply wonderful, among the best ever (one of us tasting it is from Boston; the other lived there seven years). We had good reports about the Lobster Roll and Mahi Mahi Tacos. Seared ahi in the sandwich was almost cooked through rather than seared, tho the fish was good despite. Caesar Salad was fine but called out for a dressing with more bite, more flavor; extra points however for sweet white anchovies on top!

Altogether, there were no serious complaints except for the calamari, but no absolute raves except for the chowder and perhaps the salads. For the prices, it should be more consistently good-to-great. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable place with some real highlights. We may well give it another chance when we are next in Santa Barbara."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Probably the best view in Santa Barbara on the second floor. The food is nothing special but Sometimes there is a price to pay. I honestly have not been back but the owner reached out and thanked me for my review and it was nice seeing that he responded to the review. I will probably give it a second chance now because honestly the food wasn't that bad.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Bad experience with manager. Been here a few times and service is hit or miss but the food and view make up for it. Except the last time.. Manager came up to me and rudely demanded that he took my coffee away that I just bought from an outside vendor. If the hostess that I just talked with, told me the rules that you cannot bring in an outside beverage I would've gladly drank my coffee outside and thrown it away.  Or if the manager came up to me in a professional way and told me their policy, I would also understand. Instead, he comes up to me like a bouncer and talks to me like I just committed a crime. Yet, doesn't talk to me with complete sentences and just says, ""You need to give me that."" I'm first confused and try to pass him my menu.. but he interrupted me and pointed at my coffee and said, ""No, that."" Doesn't explain why or ask politely at all. I could care less about the coffee. It's the principle of talking to a paying customer and a repeat customer with respect and an explanation. You're a manager, not the police or a bouncer. 

On a side note, my wife pointed out (after he took my coffee) that the table next to us also had a outside drink sitting on their table. But for whatever reason the manager didn't give her any issues about that, even though he stood near both our tables with his arms crossed peering toward our table. 

Food is ok. Had good and bad dishes. Had to return octopus because it was undercooked and slimey."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Don't waste your money. People with kids were served while we sat there waiting..., although we had arrived way b4.
Done with the the discrimination of people who choose to remain childlesss...go elsewhere, you'll be glad you did!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Came here on a Sunday evening at 6:30 with a friend for the first time and we just sat at the bar upstairs. It was not busy at all and the restaurant has nice views. The service was slow and we had to ask our bartender if we could order. We started with drinks and calamari. Our calamari never came out so we orders clam chowder. The calamari took 15 minutes to come out which was really battered and cold. It was basically a bunch of little pieces of calamari caked with batter that turns into battered crumbles. The chowder was good. We sat there for a little while bc our waiter never asked if we were ready to order dinner so we just asked if we could order. My friend ordered the fisherman's platter and I ordered the burger(yes I know they say you shouldn't order a burger at a seafood restaurant but I felt like one.) anyways, I ordered medium well and it came out like hockey puck...whatever. My friends fish was undercooked. I also ordered the shrimp and scallop skewers to go which are 30 dollars and when I got home they had forgotten the shrimp and only had scallops. Not once did our bartender ask how everything was, knowing it was our first time there. Maybe he was too busy arguing about drink orders with one of the servers and having to get the general manager involved about how the orders should look, who knows. This place might be good but for my first time I got horrible service with halfway decent food for the price so it only gets one star. I think this place also pays to have the best reviews first when you check out yelp because they are all 4 and 5 stars at the beginning. I won't. be coming back here."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The BEST happy hour in Santa Barbara. EVER. I'm not kidding. I'm pretty sure I'm Bluewater's biggest fan. How do I know? (this review is based on happy hour)

When I turned 21, I had an obsession with Happy Hours (still do). I even made a chart of all the Happy Hours in Santa Barbara that I could hit throughout my last year in the area. I've been here three times, with three different friends. You best believe I'll bring my family here after graduation too. Why?

The service: Excellent! I never caught their names but the hostess always greets us with a smile. I've always sat upstairs and like to make conversation with the bartenders. There's another middle-aged server who really helped us out during our first time here and gave us drink recommendations. It's never hard to get their attention to order and your items are promptly cleaned up.

The ambiance: This spot looks like it was pulled out of Home Living Magazine, like a display from Southern Comfort or something. It is so cute and cosy, almost like a nautical American IKEA room! There's plenty of space upstairs and downstairs. The location is right by the beach so when the weather's nice, the view from the balcony is amaaazing.

The food and drinks: The BEST bang for your buck in terms of food, portions-wise too.

DRINKS:
Tequila sunrise - I loved the fruit juice that didn't have the grainyness that I've experienced at other places. It tastes very sweet and light but hit me in the end.
SB Gin and Tonic - Their signature and it was recommended by the water. It tastes refreshing and crisp! One of my favorite cocktails of all time, no joke. It goes so well with the food.
Cucumber mojito - A simple drink that feels like summer. The drinks here never feel like they need to be washed down by food (as in, the ratios are just right). 
Mai Tai - This is the strongest drink but you can still enjoy its flavor! I love the dark cherry that it comes with.

FOOD:
Garlic parmesan fries - GET THEM!!! Portion is decent and the garlic ratio here is wonderful. It's fresh garlic and the spice of the garlic makes the fries smell soooo good. They are generous with the cheese. 
Crab and artichoke dip - We were convinced to get this by our waiter. It's real crab, not imitation, so the seafood taste and creamy artichoke dip came better to be delicious and savory.
Chicken wings - I was skeptical because it sounds so basic and I thought it was going to be small, but these wings were big! Not like regular buffalo wings; they have the entire wing. You can get full from this. 
Fish tacos - One of the only items that are small, but you can dress these up with nice bottled salsas. Try every one!
Calamari - It tastes great but this is probably the only subpar thing I've had at Bluewater BECAUSE they gave us four pieces of calamari and 2 20 pieces of bell pepper.

This happy hour will leave you full and happy. I think the HH prices are great for what they give, and beyond the food, I'm a big fan of the experience overall."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Expensive, faulty payment system, ok food, below average service, good building exterior."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Can u just serve our order at once. no one passes just to see if we want more water. We were bypassed so many times .. oh but the place was empty not crowded at all..not planning to go back so many other delicious restaurants !! Save your money !
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Had high expectations for this place. Presentation was good, but nearly all of the food was subpar. The fish was a little overdone and rubbery. The fries were really good. The biggest disappointment was the lava cake that was fully cooked through and had no lava at all."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Seemed like they were trying to make the best of a bad situation considering COVID-19 but our service was slow. They food was not great for the price. I got the lobster roll and asked for a small side salad instead of fries and was told not without an extra charge. My husband got the seafood platter and he said it was a 6. 
One fun thing was that you could get drinks to go and it was right across from a beautiful beach."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Stopped here on a Thursday just off of prime season for the area. We had no problem being seated in their bar area. We sipped on a glass of wine and shared the lobster roll while enjoying a beautiful view of the Pacific on a warm, sunny, breezy and lazy afternoon. 

The roll was a bit bland for our liking so, I asked if the chef had fresh tarragon. The friendly bartender was happy to ask the chef for me, and returned with the tarragon a few minutes later. The tarragon made all the difference in creating a tasty roll. Thank you chef for accomodating my request. Can't wait to return. 

There's parking at the back of the building."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Had a great meal here on a beautiful day.  Try the hot lobster roll.  The staff was great.  Extra shout out to Gil the busboy who went above and beyond to take care of our party.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"During covid these guys are doing great job. Masks on and the server wear face shields and masks. They're doing great job.

Location is amazing. The servers are super nice.

The food was great ! We will come back"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Some of the best seafood ever. Try the seafood platter and you will taste some of the best fried scallops in the world! So tender. Service was friendly and laid back. Great location and great fresh seafood. Would recommend
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Agree with Vanessa R. Way better restaurant options in SB!
The bad: Disappointed with our dinners. I had the Halibut and husband had the swordfish. His was overcooked and mine was wayyy overcooked. Sauces on both dishes were bland and just too under seasoned .

The good: service staff incredibly friendly , cool place inside with ample seating and if lucky to get ocean view amazing scienic ocean view. Had Brussel Sprout starter and that was good . For dessert shared the Coffee Ice Cream Pie (Mud Pie) it was so good!
Would come again but only for drinks with a view and dessert"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I have mixed feelings about this place. Anna our server was amazing but the food was not that great. My partner and I went for dinner started off with a mule and an oyster shooter both drinks were not done well. The mule was watery while the shooter was way too spicy to be enjoyable... they need a better balance. The fisherman's platter which included fried fish, shrimp, & scallops was average and not worth 25+ dollars. It was burnt and bland. Their mussels with pork belly though... I would go back for that! It was a delicious meal even though it was listed as An appetizer we ended up just having this after we saw the fish and chips. The sauce in it makes the dish. I would've loved to dip my bread in the sauce but no amount could've taken that burnt taste away.  May go back only to get the mussels I'll save my drinking money for another place."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,You get two skewers one with three shrimp and one with TWO little scallops. I think it cost $22.00 For that amount I think you should get at least 3 scallops. I actually thought I would get about four of each type of sea creature. The two sides were good and staff was attentive.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Wonderful crab and artichoke dip, salmon was quite over cooked and chewy...so that's unfortunate. But cute atmosphere!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Very good happy hour deals on food (burgers, fries, etc.) and drafts. Very accommodating staff. We made Friday 5pm reservations for our large party of 17 and they delivered. Wait staff was on the ball and super friendly. We had a great meal (I recommend the shrimp sliders) at a pretty damn good price (our bill for 2 adults and 2 kids with drinks and tip was $60). I would totally go back to this place. Highly recommend if you have a large party and/or little ones."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Good place for dinner! The Nero Pasta with the squid ink was delicious, and the half and half clam chowder was also definitely worth it. The restaurant had a nice ambiance, and service was very friendly."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Beautiful 2nd story patio! Everything we had was delicious! The margaritas were strong (in a good way) The crab artichoke dip was warm and delicious. My husband had his first lobster roll here and it didn't disappoint. I opted for a bowl of New England clam chowder and a grilled fish taco and both were excellent!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Beautiful location. Great atmosphere. We had friendly service. I really liked the spicy edamame and my NE clam chowder. I was disappointed with my grilled halibut, very bland. My friend had the grilled, skewered scallops and she felt hers had no flavor as well. The location would bring me back but not the food sadly."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Yikes! Great decor but the food and service we're incredibly blah. Orders the grilled octopus, beet salad, Caesar salad, and shrimp cocktail...after exploring the area. The food was not tasteful at all and the service was incredibly mediocre with unfriendly and near absent server. We are from Orange County and are familiar with food seafood and service...

The one saving grace is that the restaurant is clean and asthetically pleasing."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Came here for dinner last week with a friend. The atmosphere was beautiful. Very modern, clean, and beachy. Good service from the hostesses to the servers. However, the food was terrible. We started off with grilled artichoke and clam chowder which were okay. Grilled artichoke is hard to screw up. Clam chowder was decent. For mains, we ordered the ahi tuna with baby carrots and fingerling potatoes and a grilled octopus dish. Both took a long time and were cold upon arrival. The tuna (one of the most expensive fish options) was mushy and clearly of very low quality. The sauce that was recommended to us was very ill paired. It was very oily and the flavors clashed. The carrots and potatoes had no seasoning at all, bland. The octopus was cold and chewy and the sauce was very salty. I will rarely leave a negative review unless I am severely disappointed with the quality of food. This was shocking considering the overall Yelp rating of the restaurant. There is MUCH better seafood in Santa Barbara. This was a horrible representation."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,On July 4 I returned to my favorite favorite favorite Santa Barbara restaurant the Bluewater Grill and once again the food was spectacular the service was spectacular and as always Colin the manager keeps the restaurant beautiful and happy and humming! I'm returning for the second time this week tomorrow with a different friend! Brilliant kitchen Chanelle the chef is THE BEST!!!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"It was ok.  We got in with no wait,  ordered and then the resturant filled up and it took a while to get out dinner.  I got the black cod and the misses got the local white fish.  Is was ok at best. Not what we were expecting."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Colin the manager told us we get ran out of rolls to make a hot lobster roll. Sad they mismanaged their supply to satisfy customers.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We took the grandkids for dinner Sunday night. We were seated at the base of the lighthouse which the kids thought was great. Our waiter was very nice but was busy hosting and bar tending. I'm sure he was very busy but we were neglected all evening. I finally had to go to the bar to get our bill. 
The New England clam chowder was some of the best I have ever had. The petrale amandine had no almonds or typical brown butter sauce. Blah, dry and tasteless. Apparently they forgot the sauce. I would have questioned the waiter but he did not come to check how our dinner was. The other meals were pretty good but not great. Two of our family had the cioppino tasted good however each bowl had one snow crab claw. Obviously very old. Not edible. Frozen too long. When cracked, fell apart and smelled bad. 
We may try it again but next time will sit elsewhere."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The Manager Colin is fabulous as is the food, the waiters, the menu EVERYTHING!!!! We loved it and we're going back soon! And they even have their own parking lot with a nice valet!

Today was my 2nd visit and 2nd incredible meal at Bluewater! Colin was amazing AGAIN and our waiter, Josh, is the best waiter in Santa Barbara; a thorough professional!!!! GOING BACK SOON!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Food was great! Service was great! Only knock on them is their outdoor seating area leaves a lot to be desired. While other restaurants of their caliber have comfortable and pleasing outdoor seating areas, I felt like I was eating on a picnic table out in the middle of the street (which I was). They definitely could put more effort in providing a better dining ambiance."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Beautiful interior, super cool personal, delicious food, one of the best place I ever seen. Second floor outside  patio is a perfect place to watch sunset with glass of white wine and oysters! 10 stars!!! Thank you"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Service was really good which is why i gave it three stars , but this restaurant is not allergy friendly at all. Barely anything on this menu states garlic and we picked this restaurant based on that info, yet everything i chose including the lobster mac n cheese had a ton of garlic in it . Never ever i had lobster mac n cheese with garlic in it . The only item in the menu that i could eat  was the lobster roll which I ordered connecticut style (drawn butter) was tasty but it was disappointing . They also serve raw garlic fries and the table behind us ordered them so the horrible stench of raw garlic made it feel  like i was at a dodgers game . Probably won't return to this restaurant as the menu was deceiving and as hard as the server tried the kitchen just didn't cooperate and left me no choice but the lobster roll . I wanted the steamed clams. this is the only restaurant that said they would not make me an order minus the garlic. It wasn't busy either so not like i asked for a lot. just don't throw the garlic in the sauce and wasn't willing to accommodate  . Therefore I can't recommend this restaurant for persons with allergies no matter what it might be."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,What an absolute oasis during these weird times. We had perfect service from start to finish. Starting with our hostess Taylor who was just lovely and remembered details about after we had our meal as we were leaving! Our meals were extremely tasty shrimp tacos and well seasoned as was the crab louie salad. Our oystersters were perfectly fresh! All together a perfect meal gorgeous view on the roof top patio of the Santa Barbara harbour. I highly recommend.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great location downtown right across from the beach.  I had really high expectations for this restaurant based on other reviews but left feeling that it was more on par with reasonable chain restaurant.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"First and last time in. Place was almost empty on a Saturday night, should have been a clue, right? Waiter was fine before we ordered and then disappeared. My ""fresh"" fish, locally caught tasted as if it I'd been packed in salt for a long journey. Even though I only ate two bites, the waiter never stopped by to ask if everything was all right. Our drink glasses went infilled for the entire meal and the only appearance of any staff was to present the bill. Which I paid and left. Skip this place, there are way too many great places to eat nearby to bother going here. In a word, Disappointing !"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Friendly service. Happy Hour was a great value. Food was perfect. I especially liked the Manhattan clam chowder and old bay chicken wings. And the view can't  be beat.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Absolutely the best seafood in Santa Barbara!
Great location. 
Friendly and knowledgeable staff.
Local fresh seafood.
Beautifully prepared seafood with amazing taste to match.

A must if you're visiting and traveling in SB"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Reservations recommended. We were able to walk in but waitied 30 minutes and could tell the wait got progressively longer.  Friendly staff, service was okay, but lagging a little did not take away empty plates.  Full bar is a plus.  Strong drinks but didn't seem mixed well.  Steak and Salmon were amazing, augrautin potatoes were great.  Sea Bass was the special, but not really impressive."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I have been to blue water a few times but I came this time because of their no corkage fee! At first it was an okay experience, server was friendly. But after we ordered our food it took a very long time to get to our table, we saw it sit in the food window for at least 10min. Our food was lukewarm, portions were small, overall an unsatisfactory experience compared to last time, definitely gone downhill."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Exceptional food, service & ambiance!!! We would defiantly recommend. Upon our return to SB we will be dining here again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Fresh seafood and nice ambience, service was little slow. We had to request water 3 times."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We have always loved the Blue Water Grill as a spot for excellent cocktails and small plates. Inhabiting one of the desirable premier commercial oceanfront properties, this space was originally The Lighthouse Restaurant, afterwards Rusty's Pizza. Love sitting upstairs and at the bar....however with this Pandemic in full swing we are happy to have any seat! Most importantly this restaurant has some really amazing people who bring us back over and over again! Collin and Dallas are outstanding and this business wouldn't be the same without them! Thank you!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,What a wonderful lunch we had today. Our meals were delicious and the ambiance exceptional. Our server Roberto was friendly and provided great service.  We look forward to returning again soon.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"For a Labor Day Weekend...wonderful and attentive staff and served fresh seafood. My favorite was the oysters, rockfish ceviche, and Alaskan King Crab Legs.  The restaurant consistently followed the CDC guidelines and made our outdoor dining experience memorable. Love the Santa Barbara atmosphere."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The lobster Mac and cheese was amazing, the drinks were great; the patio is perfect during COVID-19 restrictions. Lots of mask wearing and hand washing. Pleased with the friendly service."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Chain restaurant tourist trap with marginally mediocre service. It has the standard, overpriced fish ($18 sanddabs?!) and the wait staff has all the charm of airport restaurant workers. There are better places with better food and better views."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Reservation at 7:00. Sean  did not greet us until 7:15. I expect in a world class restaurant with world class food, in a world class location to be at my table or a wave of hand within 3 minutes. Drinks did not arrive until 7:30. I don't care how slow the service is as long as there is a drink in front of me. Most of the time I have too much blood in my alcohol system.
I should have called to see if you had the Uni and the octopus, You were out. Sean stated he would comp us the scallops? when we got the bill he charged us for the octopus? My mistake I should have looked at the bill. CK # 40021 Jan 2nd. Which was on his tablet and hard to read. I felt very intimidated with the electronic tablet as the waiter stands there with the flashing 20% tip in bright red, with no instructions as to adjust the tip. as the service was worth 15% Many other restaurants in town, I'll stay out of this one, very intimidating."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"A group of us went there for dinner and we made the reservation ahead of time. My food was OK, nothing special and it was overpriced.  The service was no good.  I had to keep asking the server just to get a glass of water.  The worst part was at least 5 of us were charged twice for our meal.  The server Miguel J. insisted on running my card twice even though I told him it was not necessary because I already completed the survey and paid the tips on their computer system.  He took my card out of my hand and ran it again, except this time he completed the survey as if he was the customer and gave himself the highest rating.  Hopefully this is not Bluewater Grill's  normal practice by charging customers twice! BEWARE!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This is worth it guys! Highly recommend Ricardo and Collin (with the pretty eyes). They really know how to take a dining experience to the next level. Food and drink was great! Get the scallops and poke!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Been a few times and had some good meals. Mediocre staff, not very attentive. Heard it's not local sea food but not sure.  If it's not, it's a sad with the ocean right next store. Manager came up to us and rubbed us the wrong way.  Not sure how to explain but he demeanor is arrogant and intrusive."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This restaurant was amazing! We brought our high school girls lacrosse team to Santa Barbara this last weekend and scheduled our team dinner at this restaurant.  Colin went above and beyond to make sure our 70 person event ran smoothly.  The location, atmosphere, food and service couldn't have been any better!  Everything was perfect and we were able to get in and out in under an hour and half. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Chicken is not the chef's forte.  My chicken was rubbery and bland. It was replace at my request with mahi mahi which was passable but nothing exciting. The portion was larger than average. Also bland.
The large portion of scalloped potatoes were slice thick instead of fine slices. One section looked like it came out of a scooper. No crispiness or hint of baked cheese. 
Service was good."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great food, great service, great location! This is the second time we were there, its right on the ocean front!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We were in Santa Barbara for 3 days and this unfortunately was one of our least favorite dining experiences

 Everything here was ""fine""- my husbands swordfish was good, but my daughter got the fish dipping sticks and they were inedible.  My lobster, our clam chowder and mussels were just ""fine"" - not worth what we paid.  The  staff seemed a little unprepared for the dinner rush, as our order was lost, they never brought us bread, my
husband  never got his drink refilled despite bringing it up multiple times."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"There are quite a few seafood places in downtown Santa Barbara, and this one I would say is ok. The ambience right on Cabrillo with views of the ocean and pier is the selling point. For happy hour, the options are good although the quality of food from Enterprise Seafood Company or the Fishouse, both within walking distance, is better. The happy hour options were someone bland; we tried shrimp sliders, calamari, grilled fish tacos, and crab dip. Crab dip was the stand out. The happy hour drinks are standard and priced fairly. There is valet for hard to parking moments. Overall, it is a chain seafood restaurant in a great location."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,I don't recommend this restaurant. We were seated and forgotten about. 3 out of 5 of my party got served water and then the table next to us that was seated after us got their orders taken before us. We got up and walked over to Flor de Maiz. MUCH better service there. Do yourself a favor and skip out on this place. The service is absolutely terrible.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"First time out in Santa Barbara during COVID. We are avid Santa Barbara day travelers but this was our first time at Bluewater Grill. I had a hankering for fried shrimp and I don't like how Brophey Bro's. changed their recipe. We ordered the Calamari, fried shrimp and ""hot"" (meaning butter instead of mayo) Lobster Roll. The Calamari was seriously some of the best I've had. The shrimp is small but very good. The Lobster Roll was a pass. It was claw meat and dry, kind of cheap for the cost. We ordered the Key Lime pie for dessert. The manager Colin came by and asked about our meal. We told him all was great except the Lobster Roll. He ended up comping our pie, which by the way was scrumptious! We know that this time during COVID it isn't easy running a business but, that is what I call customer service. Oh, and if you get a chance, they make a mean Mai Tai!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Came here for my birthday and they gave me the best service ever. Mike E. was my server and made my birthday experience great. He deserves a raise. Best server 100/100 experience!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Only been there twice...tonight and nearly a year ago when they first opened...food is very good.... service awesome....Eric was our server a yr ago and tonight......he remembered me :)......best thing about tonight was Eric.....lovely smiling face friendly manner very professional.    We will be back soon.....only if Eric is our server......Connie from Sicily :)

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Everything I ate was amazing! Oysters, crab cakes, shrimp/scallop skewers, and creme brûlée...so yummy!!! Great views on the second floor.  Cannot wait to go again!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We ordered several different dishes and they all tasted great! A lot of the wait staff seemed fairly new, however they were hard workers. We also had the Lava Cake and Key Lime Pie, both were delicious!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had a delicious afternoon at Blue Water Grill, sitting at the bar on their upper level, overlooking Stearns Wharf . . . another beautiful day in paradise. 

Thanks to our server Richie for walking us through their extensive menu of cocktails, wine, and delicious seafood. He made sure we were well fed AND entertained.

Oysters, salads, and seafood pasta were all very tasty. Still have a lot of other dishes to try. We'll definitely be back"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Pretty sure based on other reviews that this is a restaurant for people who never go to nice restaurants. Awkward layout with weird seating arrangements, overpriced entrees, slow as molasses service (had to ask for everything 2x - ""oops I forgot let me get that for you"" only works once, people.) bleh wine list and the mixed drinks were great if you are into syrupy-sweet mixers. Dessert is about the only thing that's worth the price in this place - but don't expect anything exciting. 

The one upside, if you can get an outside table, the view is lovely, though only good if it's warm out - the heaters are horribly lacking if it's below 65. They also won't bring you a blanket unless you ask, so uh, protip, ask for a blanket.

Better seafood with a view for less - Brophy's. Far better drinks for same price, Lark/Les Marchands/anywhere else in the Funk Zone. Same corporate feel and enormous menu but better service, Lure Fish House. Similar quality but WAAAY cheaper, Enterprise Fish Company. Just trust me and pass on this one.

Oh, and, for trans friends and anyone who needs a bathroom, they're breaking CA state law by labeling single occupant restrooms with male/female gender markings instead of designating them all-gender/gender-neutral restrooms."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Food was fantastic, hot sourdough bread, great service and say hi to Mike. The front staff is very welcoming. Highly recommend the sand dabbs..ate them all"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,We were looking for a fish restaurant on the yelp site.  And we chose this place because of its rating.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed.  We sat outside. The floor was very dirty.  We got the first dish quickly.  But we got the main course after an hour.(   The explanation for this was that they had a big event). i ordered a whole grilled fish .dish  was very small and burnt not the quality you would expect in a place like this.  The best thing that was there was the nice waitress we had. and the firs dish was good . kids food was ok but not because of that we come to eat there .
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Kitchen Has a Big Issue With Seafood
We were so excited to have clams and muscles in a garlic and wine broth to begin, followed by a crab louie salad and crab cakes. At least five of the clams had sand in them. There was hardly any broth to dip bread in and we felt like we just had bread for lunch. When we told the waiter about the clams, he said, ""Well, you know they are from the ocean."" He may need more training. We just had them bring us another crab cake order, before we even began eating these two small patties. There was shell in the crab cakes. This IS a kitchen problem. What's sad is that this place looked good online, and why we chose it, and it is a beautiful building and patio. To their credit, they did take the clams off our check, yet they did charge us for the second crab cake. Also to the credit of their GM, he offered for us to return that evening for dinner. We had only one night in town and chose elsewhere."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great seafood in the SB with a nice lively vibe.  Tons of fresh catches of the day to choose from. Only bad thing was that no draft beers available that night due to non-working equipment.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Great location, I love Santa  at ata but the food was anything but great, we asked for a medium well stale and they brought it back bloody, no big deal right? Well they took it back and removed the tomatoes and the sparragis  were not cooked at all, it's a bit over priced but we do get that is Santa Barbara. Wasn't impressed by the service at all"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Yvonne was awesome! She took care of us at the upstairs bar. We had oysters and branzino, wine and a delicious spicy margarita! We will be back!"

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had an excellent dinner at Bluewater Grill.  It was our second visit and did not disappoint.  We tried and enjoyed several dishes: clam chowder, Caesar salad, sanddabs and shrimp.  Everything was delicious, and the portions were generous.  The service was also excellent.  We will definitely return on our next visit to SB."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Usually we don't do Valentine's Day the day of because who wants to wait 2 hrs to be seated. So we decided to come here for Our post Valentine's dinner. We went during lunch time really wanting the King Crab legs and my husband wanted The lobster and steak. Usually this is served during dinner time. We kindly asked if it was possible to ordered it and of course they said yes. The food was AMAZING  the staff very friendly. Thanks for making our post Valentine's Dinner special. We came from Los Angeles and we will be return soon.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had a really nice lunch here. Great service, great food, nice location and super views from the upstairs patio."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We ordered crab cakes, honey crisp apple and burrada salad, a clam chowder and the spicy edamame. We were disappointed. There are two pieces of crab cakes: one of them was excellent, the other one had no sauce and was on top of a lot of oil. The clam chowder was super cold. The salad was bland and the spicy edamame was not spicy. I will not return again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"It was a ridiculously hot day today in Encino! 118 degrees. There was no relief in sight other than Blasting all of our air conditioners at full throttle, but The DWP and our Mayor asked us not to do this.
So, What to do?
Head for the beach and just drive. That being done, my wife and I end up in Santa Barbara at 3:30 p.m. It was a comfortable 79 degrees and I wanted an ice cold beer and lunch / dinner.
We happened upon The Bluewater Grill just across the street from the S.B. Pier and Marina. 
These nice people really had their ""Covad Protocol"" together. Safety was of paramount concern and everybody acted responsibly and hassle free. 
Seeing this was our first big time, grown up, serious sit down meal at a restaurant since March 9th, I was not only comfortable but excited to ""Be Back"" in restaurant mode.

My fried seafood platter with cole slaw and home made potato chips was really very good. My wife's branzino and French fries was equally as good. 
Eating this lovely meal 40 degrees cooler than my backyard, while looking at the deep blue Pacific and with a staff so well trained while giving their patrons ""It's Nice To Have You Back"" treatment, made our first outing in months a very nice experience. 

Thank you Bluewater Grill - we'll be back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place was pretty good. 

The crab dip was one of my favorites that I tried. the edamame was good, too. It has a spicy kick to it. The artichokes could have been more tender and had more meat on them, though. The strawberry mimosas were amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the Caesar Salad that I had the first time I came here. I dislike anchovies and wasn't prepared for the overwhelming flavor (I'm aware that there's anchovies in the Caesar dressing, but you could really taste the anchovies throughout the entire salad). Clam chowder was a bit on the salty side, but not horrible.

The open air bar was really neat, as was the upstairs deck.

Service has been great both times I've been here.

Will definitely come back for drinks and the upstairs area."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came in for drinks and appetizers, sat at the bar and was served Danni, she was great. Recommend some great drink and was fun to talk to."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,The restaurant is beautiful and the view is magnificent!  The service and the food are not the quality that delivers a great dining experience.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Come to the Bluewater and ask for Ricardo. He gives exceptional service and makes it a pleasant  experience. Great food and drinks as well!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great food and service. I highly recommend the ahi sandwich and Mahi Mahi tacos. I prefer eating at the bar or outside deck on the second level for the views as well.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Had dinner here tonight as an E-Crew Member, we got an email invite for a soft opening. As a long time E Crew member of Bluewater, this is a great location and addition to the restaurant family. Always a great time at Bluewater, servers are always friendly and fun, management always go out of their way for their guests, and the food is also just as good. Thank You Bluewater Grill for this new location. If you come visit, ask for the general manager, Colin, or the manager Gerry. Thank you to the Chef Channel as well! From the front door hostess to the end of our meal, overall it was a great experience."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,My friends and I did a day trip to Santa Barbara and stopped here for a bite since it was close to the pier and had its own parking lot. We were seated quickly although it was Memorial Day Weekend and the service was fantastic. Carlos was quick to get us what we needed no matter what the request. The food was impeccable and we left totally satisfied! 10/10
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"First timer, me and 3 others and immediately noticed it was a very clean place. We had the chance to sit at the second floor patio with ocean view and it was beautiful. However the service wasnt recognized as of how modern, chic this resteraunt represented. We asked for shade and had to wait 30 minutes bcuz the waiter rather have the bus do it. The sticker was still attached to the lemon on our lemon wedges, they filled up my Sprite with water by mistake when it was too late for me to stop them, they notified us that our clam chowder is a fresh batch but it was not hot. Had to teach myself how to use the card payment device too. In the end, GOOD flavors of food, relaxing atmosphere but service and experienced isn't effective enough for me to come back as a local."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Excellent friendly service. We had reservations and we were promptly sat when we arrived. We sat on the patio with a beautiful view. Our server was bubbly and knowledgeable about the menu.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,My friend Jen and I were visiting SB for a few days and this was our splurge dinner! It was the perfect choice! We had a fabulous evening from our super enthusiastic server Raya to the other waiters checking on us. We also got a personal check in by the GM Colin who was super gracious. We both ordered the Snapper and had it bronzed (blackened) in cajun spices....wow!! Amazing flavors! Loved it.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Mixed bag
The goods: calamari, kids meals, the mixed drinks (which, in Santa Barbara, is expected), cioppino and oysters.

The blah: the scallops and the asparagus mushroom risotto on which it was served. Such a commonly delicious dish, this one was markedly bland. Couldn't taste the mushrooms, or the asparagus (though it seemed to be filled with both) maybe the ingredients were old. But the lack of salt nullified the dish. Did you forget the Parmesan? Or used unsalted butter? Who knows. It was just tasteless. The scallops were bland as well. At least it kept me on my diet. I didn't finish. 

Other blah: the sand dabs. Usually served with a butter sauce or a Parmesan crust, these dabs were drabs, and again my wife and I looked at each other, confused by the bland flavor. It really seemed like they forgot something in the kitchen.

The rest of the food was great. 

The outdoor seating area was very basic - sticky, pedestrian picnic tables. Minimal effort seemed to be made to match the restaurant's internal decor and feel. We could have been at the zoo or the park. 

Also, the QR code menus were a bust. No WiFi or cell data in that alley. We needed to grab a physical menu (from the next table that had similar issues)."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Carlos and staff were amazing!! The food was great! Thank you Carlos for amazing service and a great time!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I made reservations here on a Sunday evening for 7:30 PM. It looked to be quite crowded outside which is where we were seated. It was pretty warm when we arrived but it cooled down to where it got a bit chilly around 8:30 PM.

Their outside seating was to the side of the restaurant which wasn't a great view? I think next time, we might settle for being inside since the seating outside was basically a table and bench. 

I got a cucumber mojito and my husband ordered the Pilikia Margarita. My drink was decent and just average and my husband said the same about his. I ordered the pan-seared sea scallops which were good. I wasn't able to finish it but it was missing salt and acid. Luckily, my husband ordered fish and chips so I was able to get some of his lemon juice. He also said his fish and chips was good with the exception of one piece of fish that was super fatty.

Overall, if you need somewhere to eat in this part of Santa Barbara, check this place out."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What a great find, the location is perfect the staff was amazing and the food was delicious. As a returning S.B. local I always have my favorite hot spots, here is to adding another to the list. 

Their scallops were cleaned well, which is harder to find then one could imagine, and cooked to perfection. My partner had the Fish platter, the fish was glistening with moistness, scallops and shrimp were delicious. 

I would have given a 5 star review except the napkins, I know you may think it isn't important however I was out for an early birthday day and was going to meet friends after however the lint from the napkins coated my entire outfit. It was a bit embarrassing, but if that is the only issue then I can chalk it up to 1st world problems. 

All in all a wonderful place to enjoy good food, great drinks and a fantastic atmosphere with those you love."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Unfortunately the second time here was a bit of a disappointment. Party of 5 at about 6:30 on a Saturday night, we expected a wait. We waited about 45 minutes for a patio table which was no problem at all. We received bread in a reasonable time and even ordered in a reasonable time, however our food didn't arrive for about 30 minutes and when it did only 4 of the 5 plates arrived. My sister ordered sirloin with scalloped potatoes and received cold and undercooked potatoes. The table was going to wait for me to eat but I'm glad they didn't because my salmon with scalloped potatoes arrived about 10 minutes afterwards. My potatoes were cold and under cooked, while my salmon must have been made on the fly because I still showed bright red in the middle. 

I hope it's just a rough Saturday here at The Blue Water Grill, because this experience is no where near what our first experience was. I hope this review only brings critical and constructive feedback for the staff."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Some of the best crabcakes in town. The service is friendly and high-quality. The seafood is fresh and the menu is extensive.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We stop at the Bluewater Grill on our way home to San Francisco. The Bluewater is right across the street from the beach. Beautiful views from the balcony. Our seat was overlooking the beach, Prefect for afternoon  cocktails and a bite to eat. My husband and shared Calamari and oysters. Both were delicious! I had a wonderful a Rose' wine by a local winery. It was light on the palette. Even took picture of wine label so I could purchase a few bottles for home. My husband a local beer, which he also enjoyed. Our services was wonderful, I believe our servers name was Justin. He was very attentive and ensure we had everything to make our afternoon cocktails on the balcony truly memorable. Thank you. We will definitely return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My mom and I had dinner here recently while visiting Santa Barbara. 
 Overall the service and food were great.  We did have an issue with the cold.  We were sat upstairs inside near the outdoor patio.  The door to the patio was kept open so we had quite a cold breeze all through dinner. It finally warmed up when they closed the doors to the patio.  

I started with the Garden Salad Four lettuce mix with grape tomatoes, herb crostini, radish and choice of dressing.  Overall a decent salad.  Loved that they included radish.  For my entree, I had the Shrimp & Scallop Skewer.  I was one of each.  Loved these.  Seafood was cooked well over a grill.  For my sides I had the Roasted Spaghetti Squash with Pistachio and Coleslaw.  Both of these were good.  Loved the squash.  Great flavor.  The coleslaw was a bit dry but tasty.

Mom started with the New England Chowder.  She really enjoyed this.  It was really thick with lots of clams and potatoes.  For entree, she had the Panko Fried Shrimp with fries.  These seemed like fresh shrimp that they breaded in house.  No frozen shrimp out of box.  Good flavor.  Crisp fries.

Overall a good meal.  Good food, good service.  Just need to watch the doors on the outdoor patio."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great food.  Great view.  Wonderful bar selection.  We both had fish tacos which were delicious! Our server, Jasmine, was awesome!"

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend, celebrating our anniversary. We stopped in for a drink and appetizers. We ordered a lemon drop martini, a Cadillac margarita, the baked crab and artichoke dip. The dip was great. The drinks not so much. Plus poor service. The margaritas was pretty much all mix and the lemon drop tasted like the lemon was bad. We switched to a Stella and coffee. Overall not a good experience."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Went to see my cousin in Santa Barbara with my bf and this restaurant was such a great experience! I had lobster and steak and it was cooked so well and I am so mad I forgot my leftovers because it was so so so good. They have good drinks and a nice vibe right in front of the beach, gets busy but understandable!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Quick seating and attentive wait stuff. Food is good, but nothing to write home about. Good people watching outside but on loud, dusty corner."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Very very good restaurant. The staff is soooo nice I love them!! This isn't a five star restaurant though, the food is really good but not amazing. Good vibes in the upstairs section but the downstairs lighting needs improvement. Great location and experience overall worth going!"

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came here for a birthday celebration and really had a great time. The staff were incredible, both for their service, and with accommodating our little party by taking care of our cake, helping with lighting, etc. I really enjoyed my scallops (although if I had to be picky I would have preferred them to be slightly more caramelized.) The cioppino and shrimp tacos also received rave reviews. Reservations are strongly encouraged as this place was definitely busy."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Drove up from LA . Decided to try this place to celebrate a special evening with my love. Very discouraged! We had reservation and  was told we'd have to wait an additional 20 minutes. They proceeded to sit other people before us with no reservations. Once inside, we had to wait another 15 minutes just to order a drink. The server was grumbling to another server that we came inside to sit and not sit outside. 
All the while we're sitting next to a party of four. Meaning 3 adults and 1 dog. Yes, a dog!    Here we are for a special evening having to sit next to a table where the man is talking to his dog "" who loves you baby, who feeds you good"" all while wearing a wedding ring. Sitting in the seat and he's feeding the dog food from the plate on the table. DISGUSTING!!!   Im not about to pay enormous prices for lousy service and sitting next to a table watching and hearing disgusting stuff being said to a dog.  There are too many restaurants hurting for business right now and too many people trying to make a living giving actual service that care way more than this place. Never going back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great place! Perfect location! All our food was perfect! Amazing service! We are locals and we love this place! Thank you guys, can't wait to see you again!... I recommend the mahi mahi... it is excellent!"

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Good food and great ambiance. We were seated on the rooftop patio that we didn't even know existed, what a great surprise! Fish and chips were great, lobster roll was ok, service was exceptional."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Wonderful experience at Bluewater Grill! 
I have been waiting for its door to open since 2017. Now the wait is over and the experience is just wonderful as we expected. 
I had a table upstairs which overlooks the beautiful ocean view and the pier. The service was quite slow at first (there was no server upstairs), but it improved after we notified the bartender. 
We ordered Ahi Poke for appetizer, which tasted fresh and delicious. Sirloin and Trout as main courses were properly prepared. The portion was nice, but not too overwhelming. 
The drink menu is extensive and fairly priced. We had a Mary and martini ($12), beer $6-7, a glass of Johnnie Walker Blue label for $25
The service is decent, but can be better. I'm sure the business is still adjusting from being brand new
We can't wait to be back"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Food was delicious. They were dangerously generous with the bread. I had a local Californian sand-dab fish with scalloped potatoes and season veggies. The fish was soft and well-cooked.


Parking: free parking behind the restaurant but it gets filled quickly. However there is parking at The Californian hotel parking structure which is free for the first 75 minutes and $1.50 for each additional hour"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Excellent service, the food was fabulous, they catered to our needs and requests to sit in a warmer area, away from drafty vents.

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"A monkey could've made a better steak. When I first received my plate, the meat was way to overcooked when I asked for it to be medium rare. I returned it and they made me a brand new steak- completely rare. Again, I returned it and asked for it to be redone and at this point I was just fed up and I ended up asking for it to go. The final time I received my steak, it seemed like they threw it in a box and gave it right back to me. The service was great and our waiter was AMAZING. Sad the chef couldn't get our steak right. Won't be back. Who messes up a steak???"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We have been watching this place be built for the last 3 years and were so excited to eat here. Food was amazing, staff was supper friendly and hospitable. Portion size is pretty big so sharing an entree is more than enough for both parties. Excited to come back on our visits and try other things on the menu!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Absolutely amazing!

Cute place in downtown Santa Barbara with views of the beach and water.  Not sure if they will continue the outside seating when Covid lifts, but we sat outside and loved it.

The food was so good.
The menu has cup/bowl of clam chowder, but you should know that you can ask for a bread bowl too.  I love clam chowder in a bread bowl so I can dip it.

I can't remember all the other dishes we got, but trust me you will love it.  We did get an order of french fries that came with some kind of garlic or cheese along with I think garlic aioli sauce.... It was so rich just a tiny bit went a long way.

Must try!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Food was average. Melted butter was spilled on my jacket, blouse and pants. I was told by manager to send a dry cleaning bill. I did that. I followed up, nothing received. He stated several times he sent it but I received nothing. Follow up to email was poor by him. Would not recommend."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Tonight was my first time at Bluewater grill. I usually don't leave reviews but I feel the need to share the amazing experience  I had. Ricardo one of the managers was extremely attentive and helped us with our food order and gave us awesome recommendations, the ponzu sashimi scallops are such a hit! He also told us to try the Serrano margaritas which were amazing! Our bartender Chris made sure to get our drinks to the exact level of spiciness we wanted! Loved this place !"

Our waiter was absolutely lovely and made us feel taken care of and accommodated. The three of us each ordered a Crab & Avocado Toast (I added a sunny side up egg to mine). We also did the $15 bottomless mimosa add on (which our waiter informed us and I can attest is truly was bottomless).

The Crab & Avocado Toasts were fantastic. So flavorful and a plentiful amount of crab on each piece of toast. I highly recommend adding the runny sunny side up egg as well. It added great texture with the yolk absorbing into the bread. 

The Bottomless Mimosa add on was definitely the move for us. For only $15 we each had between 4-5 glasses of mimosas. The waitstaff is highly attentive and visited our table to intermittently top off our glasses. Suffice to say, the three of us were most definitely feeling it by the end.

As it was my sister's birthday our waiter also surprised her with a small  ice cream sundae and candle. We sang to her and split the dessert. It was 1) so delicious and 2) so very sweet that he thought to do that!

I would definitely recommend Bluewater Grill. Lovely service & tasty food (pricier but expected for the area and location)."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Lovely place.  We were seated upstairs in a patio and it had a great view and more privacy.  Was worth the wait for that table.  The food was good too.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Probably the best view in Santa Barbara on the second floor. The food let's just say you're balancing bland  food with great view. Sometimes there is a price to pay.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Well, once again I am disappointed in a highly rated restaurant.   My takeout dinner had No Utensils, No Napkin, No seasonings.  The garlic fries did not even have a whiff of garlic and thank goodness I had  couple of packets of salt in my car. The crab cakes had a pretty good flavor.....but was missing the key flavor...Crab.. mostly breadcrumbs...too bad....the coleslaw was pretty good....since I requested the sourdough bread to go with my dinner, I made tongs of a sort by removing the soft center and the using the crusts as tongs.   As a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park NY, I know that if a restaurant doesn't know about a problem, it can't be fixed.....hence this review..."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We really enjoyed our dining experience at Bluewater Grill. First off, they take reservations which is very courteous to their guests considering the capacity limits. Other seafood restaurants in the area prefer you wait out front for over an hour. 
Hubs had the sea bass with ""burnt carrots""!he could not get enough of! He asked for the recipe. The sea bass was fresh and prepared nicely. It probably could have used a little more seasoning but it was really good. 
I had the surf & turf. The lobster was perfect. Impressive size, not over cooked. Delicious. The steak was really good. Also could have used a little something more, but it was good. 
The music on a Tuesday evening was a wonderful treat! And really helped cancel out the noisey kids skateboarding across the street. (Cute board shop there). 
Our waitress: so here was our side ""entertainment"". Some yahoo sat down behind us. Didn't check in with hostess. Sat down. Demanded happy hour everything at 5:59 in a dining area. She literally read the happy hour menu to him, double confirmed prices, was exceedingly patient and kind. And we, with reservations waited. She had to consult the manager for the yahoo and I got up to ""go to the bathroom"" so I could purposely run into her and ask if we could put a beer order in while the manager went out. She said of course, apologized & I gave her our order. Our beverages were on our table before I got back. Unfortunately the yahoo continued to receive back bending attention for a HH wine, HH chowder & calamari. He asked for and received a discount, then pulled out a 10$ coupon. His bill $4. I hated to see it. He ran our waitress around with his nonsense and was rewarded. we received courteous service, but kinda had to be kind but assertive.
I really wish the manager would have told him to go to pound sand or at minimum to go check in at hostess stand to wait for a table with all the other folks without a reservation, and to give proper preference to the ones with a reservation That is the only reason a star was dropped. Definitely will go back. The food was really really good."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Terrible service! I NEVER got my proper food. They brought mine out 30 min after everyone else , and made it incorrectly twice. Finally I gave up and just left without eating. Tried coming here for a special occasion and it was ruined."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Excellent customer service. Attentive and kind servers/waiters. Food was delicious. Went on a Sunday for lunch and didn't wait to be seated. Overall, great experience and I suggest coming for the amazing customer service."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The perfect compliment to Santa Barbara's Waterfront! When I think of Cabrillo Blvd and the Funk Zone I think of Bluewater Grill. If you're visiting SB add this to your list of places to check out.

Food - Stopped in yesterday for a late lunch and had the Seared Scallops appetizer and Brick Chicken. The chopped applewood bacon on top off the scallops creates a perfect harmony of surf and turf. The portions on the chicken plate are incredible, a more gourmet Hungry-Man TV Dinner. 

Ambience - This place fit's into Santa Barbara 's culture like a glove. The design of this restaurant is so aligned with the location. The attention to detail that went in creating the restaurant does not go unnoticed.

Service -  The staff is beyond friendly and very good at working the room. Yesterday it was incredibly busy and the waiters and bartenders did an awesome job communicating wait times and managing expectations."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Very very enjoyable bar... Love the architecture and it's proximity to the waterfront... The restaurant food selection was quite nice as well. Overall a lovely time.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Yvonne was a great bartender!!! Thank you for being amazing  oysters and spicy margarita was delicious.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,The food is great I had some crab cakes that where awesome! The manager on duty not so much I had asked her for some bread never got it.very stuffy place!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Boy. This restaurant has so much potential yet falls incredibly short. We went for a Sunday lunch where it was not crowded by any means. Somehow we still waited over 30 minutes to get a glass of wine and over an hour to even get an appetizer. We had to repeatedly ask for bread because quite frankly we were starving. By the time our food came (1.5 hours in) 2 meals were cold and had clearly just sat around for quite some time. I had the pan seared scallops. While this meal could have been incredible, it was probably the most lackluster scallops I've ever had. Not only was it cold, the scallops themselves were very tough, the ""goat cheese"" grits had no flavor and the asparagus overpowered every flavor on the plate. Another member of our party got the fried clams, and it was 100% breading. There MIGHT have been one piece that actually had clams in it, but frankly for $20 you would be better off getting chicken nuggets at jack n the box and saving your money. In another meal, the seafood just didn't taste all that fresh and the one seafood averse member of our party who ordered steak could have easily grilled up the steak at home. I am only giving this 2 stars, because the manager did try to make up for the poor experience, but it will take quite a lot for them to convince us that this restaurant is worth visiting when there are so many other great options in Santa Barbara."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Good atmosphere- boring food. Just the general compliant of the table was not enough seasoning. While I appreciate fresh, well-cooked food, there wasn't much flavor. Vegetables (squash) were bland and if it weren't for the capers on my fish, there was almost no other flavor. The dishes need a kick! Especially for the prices. Not sure id go back, especially with all the other seafood places in the area. Also, they ran out of the ""all you can eat"" sourdough, and that was a disappointment."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great brunch items, delicious mimosas! And great service Chris is the man! Took great care of us! The view upstairs is amazing."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Food was okay, service was horrible, the place is overprices. Typical SB Tourist Trap!

We had fried octopus (4 stars though more fried veggies than octopus), clam chowder (3 stars), a dozen oysters (5 starts but what can go wrong with oysters, right?), a lobster roll (very small) and the trout (1 star as it was more burned that well prepared).

The waitress seated us, gave us the menu and literally asked us if we wanted an appetizer. We kindly asked her to give us some time to at least look at the menu first. This rushing attitude followed us throughout the whole ""dining experience"" and peaked by giving us the check before we even finished our main course (we were not even half way through).

Value for money (food and especially service) is absolutely below a minimum standard. A one-time-but-not-again experience that only gets 2 stars b/c of the nice ambience - but, I am afraid as long as there are cruise ships in town they will get unaware customers on the hook."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Enjoyed our lunch there yesterday on the 2nd floor balcony, we were lucky to have perfect warm weather in November with such a nice view of the pier and ocean in the distance! Ordered a whole sea urchin/uni and an oyster shooter as an appetizer, totally fresh. My son and I split the 3-piece fish and chips and it was plenty for both of us. Hubby ordered 2-piece f&c's and he gobbled it up. Tasty, crispy, moist white fish, no complaints. I think their cocktail sauce is homemade, has a nice texture, clearly not made with plain ketchup...very tasty. Convenient Bluewater-dedicated, FREE parking lot a couple doors down with an attendant keeping a close eye on the cars in the lot. We would be happy to eat here again if in the area, we had a nice, casual experience. Important to note, a lady tripped and wiped out HARD on the floor when exiting the balcony, and I'm pretty sure she hit her head on some of the bar stools on her way down to the ground. She had a hard time getting up, but didnt want any help from the couple of people who ran over to assist, including one waiter. She was really embarrassed. The flat, wide umbrella stands (and there are several in this compact area) are a hazard. I, myself, tripped but didn't fall. This restaurant is just asking for a lawsuit after someone falls and breaks an arm or leg. They should hire an architect to design some other sort of overhead shade structure, maybe a retractable awning or beautiful retractable canvas patio cover. Totally doable."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Awesome service, delicious appetizers and beautiful atmosphere. Thanks for server Katherine and Dalles the Manger for making our birthday/going away party a wonderful experience!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The good: Staff were really helpful when I asked to change my reservation. And the recommended appetizer of grilled octopus was divine. Perfectly done,  fresh and tender. 

The (not so) bad: I was initially seated at a 2 top in the middle of traffic.  I had a lap top with me and needed to get work done so I asked to be moved (and I was).

I dropped my soup spoon and it took a while to flag someone to replace it.  Then,  even after I asked for another,  the server forgot and waited on a couple more tables and I could recapture his attention and request it again. 

Perhaps related,  but once I got the spoon and started eating my soup, one of the potatoes was ice cold.  Neither chowder variety was memorable... not terrible though. 

The ugly: the white cloth napkin was so linty, my navy blue pants looked like they were snowed on. I ate here before a business meeting.  Thank goodness I have a lint roller in my luggage in the car. After I mentioned it, my server acknowledged that they are linty and offered to go look for a lint roller... but...once again he seems to have forgotten.  

So, kind of hit or miss on food and service...caveat diner!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Absolutely beautiful view upstairs from the outdoor patio! Service was fantastic, happy wasn't too extensive but it was still FABULOUS!!! We had 7 beverages and five happy hour food items and our bill was $95.  That's a great deal for four people on the beach in Santa Barbara 
Restaurant is clean and really cute, clean bathrooms, just over all a very nicely place to hang out and have a nice meal 
We will definitely be back
Thank you!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Solid 4.  Walked in with a bit of a wait.  Opted to sit at the raw bar.  Raw bar items were solid, particularly scallops and sb uni.  Ordered menu items for kids. Mediocre fish (probably mistake to order mahi mahi).  Sides were good.  Bread was awesome - sometimes that can be bad sign when it is one of better parts.  Enjoyed the mixed chowder.  When dealing with host, I did hear midmeal complaints from separate party about their table service.  Does seem like you have to be in relaxed mode as service appears lagging.  It took some time to be acknowledged at the table, but service picked ip after that.  Would I go back? Probably yes, but with relaxed timeframe."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Overbooking then asking you to call back to see if you can even get on the waitlist does not work for me!  Take care of all of your big parties first and hope the locals come back....Not a good business model!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Always our go to spot when traveling or when we just want to celebrate a special occasion! We will drive the hour and a half just to be there! Kudos to our waitstaff Justin and to the manager Colin for taking such good care of us today! Our experience was well-timed by the wait staff and  we enjoyed every single minute of it! You cannot go wrong here, whether it be drink or food so stop thinking about it and just come on over lol!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We wanted to try Bluewater Grill because it has one of the best locations in Santa Barbara, for a seafood restaurant. It's a shame that having a nice location doesn't necessarily mean that the food is good.

We were a party of 7. The server came by and brought us one plate of bread (4 pieces). We had to request more bread multiple times. 

For appetizers,​ we ordered the Calamari and the Spicy Edamame. The calamari was mixed  with peppers-- and peppers is mostly what you get. The pieces of calamari that you do get, had no flavor, was overcooked, and very chewy. The Spicy Edamame was not spicy at all; it was full of oil, overcooked, and mushy. One member in our group ordered the clam chowder; it was lukewarm​, tasted like it came out of a can, and didn't seem fresh at all. 

A few entrees we ordered were the Gemilli Pasta with Shrimp and Scallops, Grilled Salmon with Spinach/Scalloped Potatoes​, and Grilled Salmon with Vegetables/Scalloped​Potatoes​. The pasta was drenched in cream sauce-- NOT a pesto cream sauce. It had two scallops and three pieces of shrimp. The salmon was bland and overcooked. Scalloped​ Potatoes reminded us of cafeteria food and the vegetables had no flavor. The spinach was just about the only thing that was decent.

We also had the Grilled Halibut with Scalloped Potatoes/Vegetables and one with Fingerling Potatoes/Asparagus. Immediately​ when the Halibut was brought to the table, we smelled a very strong odor. We only needed to take one bite to realize that the fish was not fresh and it was the source of the smell. We were not even able to eat the vegetables that came with the halibut.

We requested to speak with a manager. Within about 10 min. a gentleman​ comes to the table, does not introduce himself, and asked us what was wrong. We told him that we cannot eat the halibut dishes as the fish has a very strong odor to it. He picks up one of the plates, grabs the fish with his fingers, and smells it. He then proceeded to say, ""Are you sure it's not the asparagus you are smelling?"" We told him no it was the fish and handed him the second dish. He left our table and never returned.  

The kiddo had a Grilled Cheese Sandwich and that was actually really good and she was about the only person who didn't​ leave hungry. 

When our​ waiter​ brought us our check, he stated that the two halibut dinners were taken off the bill.

I have never experienced​ something like this before. What kind of manager picks up a customers plate and lifts the food up with their bare hands to smell it? In front​ of the full table!? Then he proceeded to argue by saying, it was maybe the asparagus that had the odor and not the fish. We know the difference between stinky fish and the smell of asparagus. The fact that the manager did not introduce himself, apologize, or return to our table at all, left us feeling shocked and very uncomfortable.

As we were leaving, we asked one of the servers the manager's name. They said the general manager that night was Colin.

Due to the poor quality of​ food and service,​ I will not be returning and would not recommend Blue Water Grill."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Don't order the scallops with risotto unless you like being ripped off. Only $29.50 for 3 medium scallops over a boatload of risotto. Tastes good, just a really chintzy portion!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Sadly this restaurant was a terrible experience... After the very nice hostess sat us it was all downhill... The waiter was rude and seemed insulted to be working in the restaurant..The appetizers were decent but the main courses were terrible... We ordered the cedar plank salmon which was barely edible and my friend ordered what they called Fish and Chips...The pieces of fish were tiny(three of them) and tasted terrible...The breading was not good... Overall it was a terrible restaurant experience...The waiters bad attitude should have been a warning and we should have left before ordering....The only good thing I can say about this place is the location....But overall,I can't recommend it.."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Unfortunately the entire restaurant was dirty including the bathrooms. The food was below average which is problematic when serving fish and raw seafood.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"What is wrong with this place? Or should I blame Yelp? Took our reservation, even sent a reminder text. But it's closed!!! Update your damn website people. And your voice message too!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Sat out on the patio this afternoon! Great service food good! But the best it was 25 degrees cooler in Santa Barbara than home Fullerton today!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Have Justin as our server, wow he is informative and professional...even told us there is one in PHOENIX which we will try!  Good food and drinks."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Warning: DO NOT GO ON A SUNDAY! They were out of almost everything we wanted. The waitress said that happens on Sundays as they get fresh fish on Mondays. Food was good but staff was unable to answer basic menu questions like ""how big is the spinach?""."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We dined here last Thursday night. It was our first time back in over a year. On the plus side, the menu is similar to what we remember, and the ponzu scallops are as good as we remembered. On the negative side, the waitstaff was really overwhelmed and wasn't as attentive as we remembered or would have liked. The lobster mac and cheese was more like a soup, and we are pretty sure the wines we were served was not what we ordered. Ordinarily, we ask for a taste, but there was no way the server was going to be able to do that for us given how in the weeds he was. We ordered both a cabernet sauvignon and a cuvee. They both had the same bouquet and sweet taste, which was very much like fruit punch. We only took a few sips of each, which wasn't really noticed by the waiter when he came to get the check. Hopefully, they can get back to normal soon."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Had a wonderful birthday lunch on the upper balcony at Blue Water. We followed the recommendations of our server Jasmine and everything was delicious. Jasmine really knew her stuff and was a pleasant and observant server. The view over the pier and harbor that are right across the street made it a perfect lunch.

This was our first time to come to Bluewater and we will be glad to come back again. Food and service were excellent. Thank you!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Lunch on a Saturday. The prices were much less than I expected they would be, the food was excellent, and the employees were professional and pleasant. We had the fish and chips, red chowder, and fish tacos. I will go back the next time I am in Santa Barbara because I found their food better than most of the other restaurants we usually visit that are on State Street. Plus, this restaurant is on the ocean and has a great view. Oh, go to the bar and patio upstairs!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Long wait time. Out table so close to their trash cans. The food was ok but I wouldn't order any mixed drinks there as they couldn't get it right.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Best clam chowder? I wouldn't know- i ordered it but the so called waiter didn't put my order in. Of course, this happened after i waited 15 minutes for him to come over. Even the busboy came over with an order of bread before i got my drink order taken. The place wasn't busy and there were a bunch of servers floating around. When the server came back with my drink i told him i was ready to order and he looked at me confused. I had 15-20 minutes to study the menu so yes, i know my order and wasn't going to risk him not coming back. My food came quickly but the chowder was still missing. When i asked for the check (because i didn't get checked in once or get a refill on my water, the chowder wasn't even on my order). Do better. The only reason this isnt a one star is because my fish and chips were fresh."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"ALWAYS THE BEST FOOD AND SERVICE IN ALL OF SANTA BARBARA!!! The seared scallops were amazing; the baked crab and artichoke dip amazing; the snapper and the lava cake all amazing! The Manager, Colin, is the most welcoming and efficient anywhere and our waiter Sean was perfect,too! THANK YOU!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The food was great but the waiter seemed to lose interest in us after the dinner was served. It was getting later and our waiter was hanging out with the hostesses up front. A bit arrogant. Took time to get dessert and coffee, finally the bill. Not anxious to return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Worst local dining experience I've had in a long time.  The location will draw tourists to their dismay, but I doubt locals will frequent often.  How about sourcing some local seafood?  Avoid this place!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"A friend recently brought me here for dinner.  It's a beautifully designed restaurant with a lovely view upstairs.  I was very impressed.  I had the plank salmon.  Fresh wild caught, perfectly cooked salmon with fresh  vegetables.  Great service and friendly staff.  If you have room for dessert, please order the homemade Key Lime pie.  Chef Chanel makes it herself and it's the best I've ever had.  Thick graham cracker crust and the perfect blending of sweet and tart.  Can't wait to return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had our wedding dinner for about 45 people and everyone and everything was wonderful! 
Chanel the chef met us the day before and did a taste test, she was open to all of our ideas and was such a pleasure to work with. The day of our wedding the staff was beyond kind, helpful and extremely attentive. The food was amazing!!!! 
We got so many compliments on the food, staff and ambiance of it all. The bar was close to our area that was just for my guests, it made the night blend well. 
I can't wait to visit Santa Barbara again just to go back to eat and say thank you ! 
Chanel good luck on your future adventures!"

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,I came here solo for lunch around 1:00. I was seated immediately in the bar area downstairs. A man took my drink order right away. He also noticed my table was a little wobbly so he brought a wedge right over and fixed it. My server came by within minutes as well. I had the fish tacos with crispy cod. OMG it was delicious. The tortilla chips and black beans it came with were also superb. They also being 3 different bottled sauces. Since I'm a wimp I had the verde sauce on the tacos and used it for a dip. It was sooo good. Perfect place for lunch and the service was top notch!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The service was good, I think I had an off lunch day because they were SO crowded and had limited seating that day. I was treated very well and I think it was a little pricy but not bad for the convenient location pretty close to the major highway on my way up north. Love the SB air, I had the lobster roll which you just can't go wrong with. I think the wait staff was short that day but you could tell they still tried very hard to do a good job and be respectful."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I'm so sad... I love Bluewater Grill but we did takeout tonight and it was a BIG mistake!
My husband ordered fish and chips with fries and seasonal veggies for his sides. I wrote in the order "" crispy fries "" ketchup and malt vinegar. 

I ordered Cioppino no salmon or not a lot of salmon. 

When I went to pick up the order I wanted them to confirm it was all correct and thank goodness I did because they gave coleslaw instead of veggies and did not have ketchup or vinegar in the bag either.  They added all that and I left. 

We got back to our hotel and I was super excited to eat and we unpacked the food. My husband opens his container to find cocktail sauce spilt all over his SOGGY fries!

I opened my bowl of cioppino to find a piece of soaking wet garlic bread on top. In the cioppino it was 4 mussels, 3 clams and 10 pieces of mini shrimps. Then the rest salmon. No crab or calamari like the picture shows on their menu. 
I ate the shellfish my husband ate two pieces of the fish and we tossed the rest away. We just ate leftover pizza from today's lunch. Super bummed we just wasted $55"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We are fans of the Redondo Beach location so when the Santa Barbara location opened up, we were excited since we now live here.  We waited couple months, giving the restaurant time to settle in and get its groove.  So often a brand new restaurant doesn't hit the road running, if you know what I mean.  When we checked Yelp again and the rating reached 4 stars, we gave it a go.  Our first visit for dinner was alright.  I would say it was saved by the efficient and friendly service but the food needs a lot more work.  We ordered 3 dishes and a bottle of wine.  Wine and Grilled Spanish Octopus was perfect.  The Ichiban Ahi or seared tuna was not sashimi grade, was a bit bland but for the sauce.  If this dish had a little more sauce, it would make the bland fish more palatable. The 3rd dish was Jumbo Prawn Cocktail with two of the prawns undercooked.  Unacceptable.  Over all, we gave it 2.5-3 stars.  The next day, friends came up from LA to celebrate my birthday, who also liked the Redondo location, so we decided to give lunch a try, to see if lunch might be the 4 stars Yelp has them at.  But lunch was worse.  We were promptly seated but ended up waiting a full hour before the appetizer came, filling up on bread and butter we had to ask for.  The Cioppino I ordered was NOTHING like the photo featured on Yelp.  In fact, none of the dishes we ordered looked like the photos in Yelp.  Upon closer examination of the photos, I would say most of it are professionally done OR sometime between then and the time we ordered our food, the Chefs left the restaurant.  The shellfish in my Cioppino was spoiled.  The broth was like mere water mixed with a little tomato paste.  My husband's Fried Clams was a disaster of over breading, burnt and clumped together on his plate like some throw away food.  He found one clam and it tasted mushy and rotten.  It was the first time my husband actually sent back a dish in all his years.  His appetite ruined as was mine.  The Diver's Scallops our friend ordered was over cooked so it was chewy and stringy and dry.  Her fiancé ordered the NY steak and this was the only dish that was cooked properly but it was cold.  In fact, all of our dishes were cold.  The manager came over, apparently, informed by our server who obviously knew the food was not up to par and of the long wait (1.5 hour before we got the entrees), offered to redo the dishes.  I passed on mine, didn't trust the seafood would be fresh.  The second time around on the fried clams and diver's scallops were just as bad, no improvement.  We were then offered 2 desserts on the house and that the bill would be waived.  They recommended Key Lime and chocolate cake of some sort.  To be nice, we waited another 20-30 minutes, the dessert never came.  By now, we were super hungry and exasperated by the wait and the whole ordeal.  We left.  The server chased after us and recommended that I emailed the GM and copied the manager.  When I calmed down the next couple days, I did email but no response.  

Update:  It's been almost a month and Jim, the Owner was able to finally respond with an apology, an explanation, and said he's addressed our issues to the Chef/Kitchen, which we appreciate very much.  He invited us back, which is also a nice gesture but the experience was so horrible, and the reviews are still up/down, not consistent, so we'll gonna hold off for awhile.  We want them to succeed so that it can be added to our list of ""go-to"" restaurants."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"How can you give a restaurant a 5-star when they don't have what you want couldn't provide your appetizer. And you settle for what you didn't want but it was a great experience. How does that happen?
I have a lunch monthly with my former boss, I retired. I wanted to go to The Blue Water.
We set down I ordered a glass of wine. I wanted the ahi with an appetizer of ebamame. 
We're catching up drinking my wine he's drinking his iced tea the waiter comes back and said the appetizers not available because the purveyor has not delivered yet. That's fine I'll just have my entree shortly he returned to tell me that the ahi has not arrived same purveyor. You know you can't make this stuff up! He informs me the manager has comped my wine. Nicely done. After my meal I asked to talk to the manager. I thanked him for all he did and how much I was really really was looking forward to the ahi. His name is Dallas he said you know what next time you're in I'm buying your ahi.
That's why they get a 5 star

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Delicious assortment of seafood dishes and fresh grilled fish. The scallops and civeche were tremendous appetizers. Had a grilled seabass that was a daily special and it was very flavorful.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Best COVID online pick up meal I've had since this nonsense started....made me feel like I was at the restaurant  Fresh, crisp and delicious. Bravo Bluewater Grill"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Pretty good seafood! It is near the sea! Nice view! They also have their own parking lot.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My boyfriend and I came to this restaurant for our anniversary, I wish we really had the best experience but unfortunately we did not. It started out great, very friendly service and welcoming. Fast seating with no reservation, inside. When seated, took about 20 minutes to be greeted. Meanwhile looking over the touch less menu what drinks we wanted we also were ready to order appetizers and entrees. When server finally greeted, Jorge our server, asked if we had any problems with the touch less menu we said no and he continued to bring physical menus. When received menus, it took about 10 min to order our drinks, appetizers, and entrees. I had mentioned no mushrooms (allergic) and entree still arrived with mushrooms. My boyfriend and I had suspected our order would be off due to no notations of complete order. After the mistakes, we flagged down Ania, let her know our situation and our experience thus far. She immediately listened and took action to make sure our experience was turned around. Our experience was definitely turned around with the help of the wonderful Ania and the genius chef. The view is great and a beautiful setting."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Arrived a little early for dinner. Seated at a tiny table less than one foot from tables on either side. Asked to move to a corner table fa4 apart from other tables. Was told that was saved for larger parties yet they had seated one woman there earlier and seated 2 people at same size table next to the one we wanted.  This was not a great start for a restaurant that has sister restaurants all over so cal that we love.  Asked waiter Tristen if we could move;  he had to ask hostess; were finally told we were welcome to move ourselves - no assistance.  Waiter was doubling as bartender.   Told him we were in no hurry. After 45 min told bus boy George ready to order. Made mistake of ordering soup salad entrees at same time. Husbands soup delivered but no salad for me.  Informed George.  Few minutes later entrees delivered.  George said salad on way and mixup cause we moved. Not true ordered from table moved to. Told him to cancel salad as already eating entree.  What a shame.  Awesome view of harbor and boats.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great food and excellent service.  Recommend the clam chowder and cioppino dinner.  I highly recommend the drinks at the bar.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Thé ambiance was great. The service was top notch, not to clingy but ever present if I needed anything. I checked in on yelp on they had a 1/2 off deal for your first cocktail. In my case it was a class of wine, and they have my FAVORITE chardonnay by the glass, which is usually only sold by the bottle and out of my price range in most restaurants. This in addition to the great service made the experience more than exceptional. Attentive but not too clingy, which is exactly what I wanted after dealing with the chaos of Fiesta. I ordered wings with my wine, and they were awful. Who orders wings in a seafood restaurant though? Everyone else's food around me looked amazing, and I'll be back to try other options. I took the wings to-go, and I gave them to a nice homeless man on the walk to my car. It worked out for everyone. It was a perfect, quiet haven after a long and loud fiesta Friday. I sat at the bar, which I usually prefer over a table in most places, and I really enjoyed myself and my crossword puzzle, with my favorite wine by the glass, in peace! I will absolutely be a repeat customer."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The Bluewater Grill was a delight from start to finish. The two-story restaurant is beautifully appointed and sits just across the street from Stearns Warf, offering beautiful views of the ocean, Stearns Warf, and folks as they stroll the beach below.

The food was exceptional, and I first have to mention their mud pie-- it's outrageous--the best in Santa Barbara (the worst can be found at The Harbor restaurant on Sterns Warf).

Appetizers were EXCEPTIONAL, and drink prices on a Sunday afternoon were incredibly cheap--a great happy hour experience.

I cannot recommend the Bluewater Grill enough. Great food, great prices, beautiful views, low prices... you can't go wrong."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"A long OVERDUE review. One of my absolute favorite places in Santa Barbara. Amazing management and staff here!!! Amazing food needless to say. Back in October they helped me out when I wanted to plan a laSt minute birthday dinner and was absolutely amazing. Love coming here and just relaxing, whether it's on the patio or inside the dining area."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Staff was beyond friendly. Accommodated very well to event. The food was fresh and delicious. Going back and trying a new fish of the day. Delicious chef!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Everything was so yummy!! The waitress was great and super friendly! We were able to get a table for 6 very last minute, and enjoyed every moment of our late dinner! Keep it up blue water grill!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Ordered Caesar salad with grilled shrimp and extra anchovies. Shrimp was crunchy raw. Sent back. 

Ordered seafood Louie - crab smelled completely rotten."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Loved the outdoor seating options! Great food, perfect on drinks and seating! Sunset dinner with kids was an amazing experience for them!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great ambient restaurant with excellent location. This restaurant is a former light house turned into a restaurant. Amazing vibes inside the restaurant. Buzz with people. Although the service is slow, they do have some good foods. I recommend their risotto scallops and crab and avocados salads. Amazing taste and flavor. Staff are friendly and the parking is plenty across the street and next to the restaurant. Best stop on the way back to LA from San Francisco. But you have to make reservation ahead of time."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Why I'm giving it one star is just because where it stand. If it was $ or $$ restaurant bar would have 4 or 5 star but when you want a high class bar with a good service you expect good service! 
You don't want to be embarrassed infront if your guests. Dirty martini instead of apple martini, sparkling water instead of beer! Seriously?!!...."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Came here for dinner while we were visiting Santa Barbara. They had lots of outdoor seating but it was very busy so glad we made a reservation! The service was good - our server was attentive and friendly. The food was just okay. I think since it's just a seafood chain, it's not as good as getting seafood from one of the other places around here. My stomach was hurting later that night after having the scallops, so have a feeling they were the reason for making me a little sick. The caesar salad was also just okay, the lettuce didn't seem as fresh. They also just had little sardines tossed on top that just didn't taste good with it. Overall, the food was just okay. Definitely think there's better seafood places to try around here."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Came here for lunch. Service was good and everyone was nice. The food menu is pretty seafood heavy so if you don't like that I'd definitely avoid. My boss had fish and chips which he said was okay. I had the Bluewater burger. They were out of fries.... so I had to get the homemade chips which were really bad. Very greasy and soggy/stale. The burger was okay at best. There are so many good spots in Santa Barbara to eat which is why this is a 2 for me.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The food was great. Our server's name was Christian. He was even greater. Thus, the five stars."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Excellent service- Christian! Delicious food & great view from patio. Awesome drink menu w/ tons of beers
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"So so . Nothing special but drinks are ok . I definitely will go somewhere else next time . Service is great prompt 
Food is ok not the best"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Awesome service thanx to Scott and Chris!.. great food!... gotta try the fish tacos!... and a beautiful view!.. had a great time!.. for sure gonna make it one of me regulars lol!.. totally recommend this spot especially for happy hour!...
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Very disappointed in our experience. The last few years we have been coming to this restaurant for our anniversary. The food is good, drinks are great and views are priceless. A week prior, we made reservations to eat there. Of course we are excited to go and eat. Unfortunately, after an hour of us waiting past our time, we decided to leave. We watched as walk ins were being seated before us. They kept telling us it would only be a few more minutes. They complained that people weren't leaving and some have been seated for well over 1.5 hours. 
It sucked because we drove over an hour to enjoy this restaurant. We thought that making a reservation would have prevented this type of thing from happening.
We hope one day we can return and I can raise the review back up. But until than, we will be going to other restaurants in area."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Loved everything we got! Delicious crab and artichoke dip and served with tortilla chips instead of bread which made it gluten free for us. 

Cioppino was so incredibly tasty, I still dream of it. It was served with cod which was perfect for us that day vs heavier mercury fish. 

We asked at first if the dip was gluten free and then our waiter put bread on the cioppino and kept trying to get me to order linguine in my cioppino. Attentive service but overall not aware of what goes into food allergies. 

Top sirloin came a little too rare but was mostly great. 

Would definitely indulge here again on a special occasion!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This place is located right on downtown next to beach. Great place for lunch if you are fish lover
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Wonderful service, delicious food, beautiful space. 

We were driving up the coast and wanted to stop at the perfect Santa Barbara spot. This fit the bill. Parking was super easy and we had 10 min until our reservation so we enjoyed walking along the water briefly. 

We sat upstairs and shared the firecracker shrimp, the chowder, the crab cakes and the bouillabaisse. All were exceptional and our server was so warm and welcoming that we felt at home the entire meal. 

Physical space is also quite neat. Take a look at the windy staircase that goes up to the tower."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This is my second review for Bluewater Grill in Santa Barbara.  This is mine and my mums favorite place.  We were in Santa Barbara 4 nights and ate there every night.  
The ambiance, the good and the employees are just phenomenal.  Very attentive, especially Colin and Yvonne.  They add that special touch where they go above and beyond to make one feel so very welcome.  
I highly recommend this restaurant.  I can't say I have a favorite food as it's ALL fantastic.  
It sure says a lot when there are many other restaurants in Santa Barbara, However we spent every night at the Bluewater Grill.
We will be back next year for our annual trip."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We came here on a Saturday night and were seated quickly outdoors. The service was great, there is an abundance of outdoor seating with heat lamps, and our waiter was kind but the food/drinks were subpar except for the oysters. The oysters were fresh and sweet and came with mignonette and cocktail sauce. 
However, the gin and tonic and the cucumber mojito were watered down and both poorly made (I am not sure how to describe this but maybe the proportions of the cocktail ingredients were off?). 
The clam chowder was good but probably not worth the price point ($8/cup). 
The shrimp and scallops in the gemelli pasta were great but the sauce, although creamy, was not flavorful and a bit bland."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Found some extra protein in our meal glad it only took 10min for the manager to come by, only to say it happens all the time."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Incredible views, and upstairs patio during COVID was still amazing. Highly recommend the blackened swordfish, definitely coming back"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Chain seafood restaurant in a touristy spot - ok food, great views and competent service."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Bomb, had the baked crab and artichoke dip for an appetizer. It was delicious. Followed it up with the King Crab legs and they were definitely on point. Finished it up with the lava cake and holly guacamole. I tapped out. Fire. Beautiful views and waiter Carlos was the man! Would definitely recommend this place and would definitely recommend getting a reservation to avoid a wait. Will be back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Today we experienced excellent service from Collin, the manager of Blue Water Grill and our server, Dani.  My husband Albe , our son James and his fiancée,Robin wanted to try their Happy Hour for the first time and we didn't get disappointed. We ordered their Calamari, Fish Bites, Artichoke Crab Dip with chips; House Salad and Edamame ( all were tasty). Service was fast. When Collin learned that we are locals , he sent us a complimentary plate of Calamari. They also offer good quality beer and wine. We highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"They have the best kids' menu I've ever seen. It's inexpensive, has healthy food, and comes in a a bento box which my 2-year son loved sampling from all the parts of.  They brought his food before ours so that we could cut his steak (I tasted it. It was good! My son thought so too, and he's picky about protein).

The adult food was very good too. My wife and I collectively had the sea bass, soup in a bread bowl, chicken Caesar salad, and lava cake.

Beautiful views of the sunset from the upstairs patio. All of the servers were wearing masks properly, which was much appreciated. Upstairs they have single stall restrooms so that my wife and I could clean up our son after he got sand everywhere on the beach. If only I lived locally and could come back more often! Yelp patrons, it's up to you to make sure this restaurant thrives until the next time we make it back to Santa Barbara."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Well we came back for our 1 year anniversary and it sadly wasn't like our last visit. 

They were completely out of blue cheese olives for a dirty martini and of the type of whiskey my husband wanted for his drink.. I also received a water glass with a huge red lipstick mark on it. 

Then we asked for bread and received the most rock hard thing ever. 

The Spanish octopus was deleted from the menu. It was by far the best thing on the menu.  We then ordered a dozen oysters instead and those were awesome. 

We ordered the king crab legs and the pasta. It was good. We also asked the server for fresh bread and he acknowledged he knew the previous bread was hard.... why would you even serve it to us then? 

We had also made a reservation through Yelp and I mentioned in the comments that it was our 1st anniversary. The hostess could see what we wrote because we asked to sit outside or by the window and she said it. However, not once during the night by our waiters was it mentioned. Kinda disappointing. 

Overall, it was okay. Just disappointed in how the night went."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,I've been wanting to eat here for awhile now & I absolutely Loved everything about this restaurant! The seafood was so fresh! The staff was super friendly! And the desserts & drinks were delicious! Definitely coming back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I tried this place a month after it opened and did not have the greatest experience. Since my second attempt months later, I've dined there about 8 times and it's easily become one of my standard SB go to's.  

Things have not been perfect, you could always tell when the staff was new and not of the ""restaurant world"", but every single time I was blown away by their friendliness and willingness to fix a problem. 

I'm so happy they are now part of the Santa Barbara community and think they are a great representation of my favorite things about this town, but also a great place to welcome family, vacationers, and newbies alike. 

Also a shoutout to the bartender Rich, he makes you feel like you're chatting with a friend and is the good guy that will always have your back. Just a genuine, nice person who does the right thing, which is so refreshing these days. 

I don't expect perfection, but I do expect great service when something goes wrong, and this is exactly why I'll keep going to Bluewater."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,There back. QC in place and all is good.  Give it a try. Ponzu the best.   I guess I need to keep writing.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Not to be confused w/Blue water SD Ocean Beach. https://bluewaterseafoodsandiego.com/
Great upstairs Bar."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Against my better judgment, I've given Bluewater Grill four tries (twice were special occasions) which is very generous for me as usually one bad experience is enough to keep me away. Each and every time the service was horrible! and from each staffer we encountered.   Staff is in serious need of training. One server argued with us the calamari dipping sauce from our appetizer was tartar sauce when we requested extra tartar sauce for the Fisherman's Platter and told us to transfer the serving vessel from the appetizer platter to the entree plate. After four visits, we've sampled enough items on the menu to make a valid determination the food is mediocre at best and even wondering if the fish is frozen which would be a big mark against a waterfront restaurant where fresh fish is readily available."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Fantastic food, great service and wonderful atmosphere. The menu is interesting, definitely try the Gemelli Pasta with Shrimp and Scallops!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Always great fresh fish no matter which location I visit. Service was excellent too! Large group for a celebratory dinner on a Saturday night.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,So so good. Had the swordfish with scalped potatoes. Absolutely delishious! Great service as well!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The food is delicious and the service is even better.  The fish is fresh, the food is cooked very well, and even their desserts are delicious. Great clam chowder too! It is a real treat to dine here.  Everyone is so kind and the manager makes sure that all of his guests are very well taken care of.  You are guaranteed to have a great dining experience if you come here and if you feel otherwise, the staff will listen to your concerns and do everything they can to make you comfortable. I've been a couple of times now and am so pleased.  I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a nice family dinner, a romantic outing, or even just sharing a meal with friends. The outdoor dining is lovely, directly across the street and facing the pier, great location!  You can enjoy a nice dinner at the restaurant and then walk the pier or just enjoy the view."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Beautiful patio view of the Santa Barbara harbor. We both ordered the Angus cheeseburger and added grilled jalapeños as well as bacon. I also added another burger patty. Was well worth it. Huge burger and delicious! Garlic fries served with it as well. Highly recommend! (PS: make sure you ask for the complimentary bread and butter).
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I loved this restaurant! Yes, it's a little pricey but totally worth it for the environment and food! I stopped by there after a long road trip and it was just what I needed! I had the risotto with scallops and my mouth is still watering from how delicious it was! The staff was great as well. Definitely will travel make this my go-to spot when I drive through SB again"

The halibut was awesome with a lemon caper burreblanc, we also ordered crab artichoke dip, sand dabs with chimichurri, salmon, and oysters! (they were bigger than I expected so as an oyster newbie it was a bit much for me, but still good & well liked among the table) 

Taylor was our server and was attentive and a positive bonus to our dinner experience as well!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I went here for my birthday dinner and I was very happy!! The food was so good. I had the surf and turf, expensive but delicious.  My husband had a shrimp and crab Louie salad, he loved it!! We had my favorite drink, a Mai Tai, not as good as the one on Thursday at a different restaurant.  The manager snd our server was outstanding!  Thanks Bluewater Grill for a great birthday dinner!!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had a large group from work Feb 11th to celebrate several birthdays and a going away party combined. We had excellent service by our server Kat who kept the food and drinks coming, was so pleasant and accommodating and made the entire evening that much more fun! We were seated outside with plenty of heaters and blankets on a chilly evening. The view is spectacular on the upstairs patio and the food was very good. All in all a wonderful party! I'll be back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Friendly staff, and great location. I ordered the sea bass and it was alright. The asparagus was undercooked and the potatoes were not good. My friends ordered the fish and chips and the fisherman's platter and they said it was good and a nice portion."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I came here the other day and ordered the fisherman's platter but what I didn't know was that the fish, shrimp, and scollops were fried coming with French fries. It was all really good anyways and made me really full."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had an amazing late lunch at this Bluewater Grill location with our Adored Grandson about a month ago. The weather was perfect for sitting outside, and we were lucky enough to snag seats at their indoor- outdoor bar upstairs. 

With a killer view of the pier and the beach, it is a premiere spot on the refreshed waterfront area where State meets Cabrillo.  Swaying palm trees frame a vista that made us feel like we were on a tropical get-away, without the hassle of boarding a plane. 

Top-notch, professional and friendly service provided the basis for a great dining experience.  As the designated driver, I appreciated the mix of fresh juices they whipped up for me, to add to the vacay vibe.

The kitchen kept us happy with fresh takes on seafood options.  Even 16 year old AG noted how well done everything tasted, and was presented. Dear Hubby and I shared an order of sand dabs and scalloped potatoes, with a crunchy slaw on the side.  Fabulously delicious!

Can't wait to return for the whole experience to be repeated."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Fresh Oysters, Wine, and a beautiful color-way of skies.  This describes the evening vibes of this location.  Even with COVID service was on point and they added seating along the bridge, which in my opinion only added to the great experience.  

Plan on there being a bit of a wait as this place is popular for dinner, but use that wait as a prompt to stroll the beach and further take in the area.  

The staff all wore masks, had a great attitude while managing how busy it was.  The contactless payment and sanitizer made the whole process of eating out during COVID safer and far more relaxed. 

The food came out great, and our waiter was both attentive and helpful. 
They even threw in an extra oyster to the half dozen ordered.  However, one of the Oysters was just going bad (the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5)... haha, maybe it was why there was the extra one.  Just glad I realized before eating it.

Overall a great location and experience.  I would prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and chop up the oyster issue to being a rarity."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Overall filling and delicous, especially the scallops. I like that the risotto flavor was milder so you can enjoy the scallops more. Scallops were a bit smaller than I expected but not bad. Nice location by the beach."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The seafood is very good, the scallops were scrumptious, the waiters are friendly. Oyster shooters are bangin, the Swordfish was off the charts as well as the Salmon. My fiancé ordered the TE-KiLLA time cocktail  and it was fire  Highly recommended! Pricey but worth it.."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,They seated us quickly with our a reservation which was very nice ! They had heated lamps set up outside.  Moscow mules were good and the clam chowder was very tasty.  Raw Oysters were also very good. Ordered the fisherman's plate with house chips.  Our server was attentive!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My wife and I went to dinner here for her birthday after several recommendations. I would give the overall experience an A-. Service, view, menu selection were an A+. Patio furniture detracts a bit from the ambiance. The halibut was cooked to perfection but the Black Sea bass was over cooked, however the waitress (Sam, awesome!) comped our desserts as an apology. I would definitely go back and recommend. The upstairs bar is great!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Considering COVID-19 this restaurant did an impeccable job in making my mom's birthday beautiful.They keep everything sanitary & up to covid-19 standards. Even the menus were contactless & accessible via QR code. Unfortunately the main dining hall is off limits for now  but a gorgeous tent w/ Christmas decorum sufficed. Heat lamps were provided.Across the street is the pier for casual dining. You get a coastal sunset view.This was my favorite part. The pricing was reasonable as well.
The food was so amazing and the seafood was fresh. I ate until I popped lol! The customer service is  great. Our server checked in multiple times to ensure we were satisfied. I will definitely recommend it, overall it was an awesome dining experience."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend for a day out in Santa Barbara. The food was delicious! We ordered the Gemelli Pasta w/Shrimp & Scallops, the Cioppino Seafood, and Ponzu Sea Scallops. The food was amazing and the food pairs well with Pinot Wine. I couldn't get enough of the pasta because of the pesto sauce. Always dip your bread on the side with the pasta! The service was great, but at one point we didn't know where our server went. I absolutely recommend this place for a date out!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"After looking all around Santa Barbara for a seafood restaurant with less than an hour wait we were recommended to Bluewater. They seated our party of 8 very quickly. The food was outstanding and the service made our experience 10x better. Jazmine was very efficient and super friendly, highly recommend sitting in her section."

We had to wait just a little bit of a wait but we loved the place. The waiter was really nice, friendly and he got our food fast. Food wise was good I enjoy my clam chowder best in town probably. Food was warm and had a great presentation can't complaint. So if next time you are in search for a great dinner spot for a date this is your place or family get together this place will accommodate your party. I recommend this place"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Walked in during happy hours and the service and food was really great. Located next to the harbor this is a prime and cozy place to spend an evening at. The happy gour clams were awsome. They even brought us a loaf of sour dough bread for free. Really impressed with the service and attentiveness of the servers
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Wow. What a wonderful location. We experienced awesome service and could not believe how great the food was. Do Not go to the pier for seafood.  Head to the best location in town - Bluewater Grill.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Visiting Santa Barbara for a three-day midweek vacation, stopped in for happy hour at the advice of our hotel. The drinks were delicious and high octane, the fish tacos were very good as well. The server brought us a huge slice of mud pie for our birthdays, house-made and amazing. The service was exceptional. I'd absolutely recommend that you stop in."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Very yummy really enjoyed their take on th raw scallops with the Asian flavors. Oysters were a bit on the salty side. Sea bass was phenomenal but the rice was hard and could careless for. Mud pie was yummy but you can tell the Oreo crust was hard and needed some thawing out. The cooked scallops were really good!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came for happy hour. Enjoyed some wine and a few appetizers - oysters, crab, and clam chowder. 
Food items came before our first glasses of wine so they gave us a bigger pour. Clam chowder was forgotten so they upgraded it from a cup to a bowl. 
I appreciated that they acknowledged their small mistakes and made it up to us. That's the customer service that makes me come back! Plus the food is good!  :) And in their defense, they were pretty busy.

 Bonus- Messaged the owner through Yelp asking about if they were still doing happy hour given our Covid-19 times. He replied instantly and wanted to say hello in person and actually tried. Only issue, we were in Santa Barbara. Not the Newport location. Ha!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Wow this place is the real deal!! We were able to sit on the patio overlooking the ocean which I highly recommend! The service was great, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was also a plus. 

We ordered a lot of food and drinks to try almost everything! Here's what I would recommend:
- mussels with pork belly (the pork belly was sooo tender!)
- tiger prawns ( the sauce was delicious but you only get three shrimps)
- the lobster Mac and cheese - so creamy 
- the scallops with bacon jam (very tasty but the scallops were a bit chewy)

Just alright
- fisherman's platter (it's tasty and a lot of seafood but it wasn't anything spectacular!)

Not recommend:
- the striped sea bass with wild trice (too bland and did not have a tonic flavor)

Also don't forget the lava cake at the end!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had a great experience overall. Good service, great food. Crab cakes and combo mussels/clams were delicious. The whole fish was really well cooked. And my 3yo had the salmon from the kids menu. For less than $9, the kids salmon was the best meal value at the table! We ordered the fish tacos, but the mahi mahi was dry. We would definitely come again. And based on the food and service, I had no idea this might be considered a chain."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great food and ambience, the staff was fast and friendly. However, they forgot the complementary breads. All the tables around us had some. We did not know that the bread had to be requested since this was our first time to visit this restaurant, and none of the staff even asked us if we wanted something. Other restaurants usually would give us without being asked. Just a small gesture would make a great impression. 

We had Sautéed Mushroom as a side dish, Beer Battered Fish and Chips, and Gemelli Pasta with shrimp and scallops. The pasta was creamy, but a little bit bland, so a little salt and pepper would help (the staff provided paper packages of salt and pepper upon request). The fish and chips was a huge portion with a lot of fries. 

Overall, nice place to check out when you visit Santa Barbara and nearby Sterns Wharf area."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,My girlfriend and i came here for an app and some drinks in the middle of the day and wow we definitely picked the right things. The scallops were heavenly and we wanna try to make this recipe when we get home! The drinks were also delicious!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Wow! The clam chowder here is amazing. I knocked of a point because the wall they seated us near was dirty. Other than that. The food was great and delicious. I wish I can have all my meals here.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I went to the Bluewater Grill on a Monday night. It was busy but we were able to get a table right away.

The restaurant is nicely decorated and very clean. Our server (Mike?) was attentive, friendly and professional.

I ordered the Scallops and my wife ordered the Alaskan King Crab. Both meals were fantastic. The crab was cooked perfectly and the scallops melted in my mouth.

For desert we shared the Key Lime pie and had a Keoke Coffee. Both were excellent as well. It's tough get a good Key Lime outside of Florida but this one was very tasty.

Parking in Santa Barbara is always tough. But parking was easy as there was a parking lot located down street for customers.

Overall, it was a fantastic meal and I look forward to coming back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We live very close to this establishment and have been excited to eat there. We called before walking over and Noel was very pleasant and got us a great table upstairs overlooking the water luckily. It worked out perfect since this was a celebration dinner. We then waited almost 20 minutes for the waiter to come to our table and ask us if we wanted drinks. We told him 2 waters and 2 cocktails and we of course knew what we wanted to eat already. We ordered 2 appetizers and the paella to split for dinner and specified that we wanted the appetizers out first. It took about 10 minutes to get our cocktails (no waters came)
10 minutes later the paella was brought to the table (appetizers did not come 1st like specified). Another 5 minutes or so after that the appetizers came out. (still no water) 
After this the waiter did not come back to the table for a long time... All the servers were very awkward/strange. I thought this and asked my wife after and she said the same thing. I also heard the person at the table next to me mention the same thing. This is very odd for a higher end restaurant on the beach. It seemed very very rookie... I waited tables for years so I somewhat know what im talking about here. Anyways, the food was very good BTW and Noel was outstanding! I give her personally 5 stars...and the cooks 4 stars...the business and everyone else gets 1 star. I do not think we will ever have a craving to try this place again unfortunately. So much for our celebration being fun! Oh well...just another day."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Bluewater Grill is one of my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara! Absolutely terrific ambience service and food.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Wait staff amazing ...plating was outstanding, food looked amazing, yet lacked. Not sure if this place doesn't use salt or what but if you enjoy bland food this is the place to go!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Came here for happy hour

Oysters (3*) - some were sweet and tasty but a lot more were a miss than a hit. they didn't have that much flavor unfortunately. 

Chowder (4*) - I enjoyed this, lots of clams and very creamy

Garlic fries (4*) - crispy with lots of garlic

Combo pot with white wine (2*) - Clams and mussels, the broth had a bit of an overly fishy smell to it, the whole table acknowledged. We didn't finish it.

Calamari (3*) - squid was cooked well, but the breading was too mildly seasoned

Mac and cheese (3*) - Cheese was mild in flavor

Pasta with scallops and shrimp (4*) - the pasta was good, scallops were slightly tough

Fisherman's basket (3*) - comes with a mountain of fries, deep fried seafood with tartar or marinara that were ok"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Well deserved 5-stars! Sophie was awesome calling back and forth and accommodating to sit us a little earlier. Justin kept tabs on us making sure we had everything we needed.

First time at this location, 2nd time overall with the other location in Temecula, where the crew was just as friendly and helpful.

Santa Barbara location has waterfront views that can't be beat. 

We started with calamari and the crab & artichoke dip. Both are awesome and recommended. Calamari has a little spice that we enjoyed. The crab & artichoke dip is fresh, well seasoned, and portion is generous (filled me up).

My wife and daughter both ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta. Another great dish and highly recommended. Two scallops and about four nice sized shrimps. I appreciate they did not fill the bottom of our plate with oil.

Mother-in-law had the fish and chips. Light and crispy flavorful batter, and moist cod. The house-made chips were crispy, well-seasoned, and not at all greasy. If you are a F&C fan, then you won't be disappointed.

Finally, my youngest daughter, ordered the lobster roll. They offer two ways: with mayo or buttered. We opted for buttered. Generous lobster portion, on soft and crispy flavored brioche bun.

Everything we ordered on the menu was great! Same experience as in Temecula: great service, great food, and nice atmosphere.

If I had one suggestion, it would be that they should offer fresh lemonade (not from the soda machine). Perhaps in the near future and our next trip up the 101 from LA :-)"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I've gone here so many times that it's become my go to spot for oysters when I miss the fish market. Sometimes the quality in the restaurants around here can be inconsistent, but thankfully Bluewater has always stayed consistently good. 

My friends and I have eaten here for lunch and dinner on the same day. The oysters and scallops along with some great drinks along the beach feels so nice"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Food was Amazing. Especially the appetizer scallops! If you are looking for a white wine to pair with your seafood, I highly recommend the Stella pinot grigio. It was light and refreshing."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We had a reception dinner at the Bluewater Grill, Colin the manager was very accommodating, we sent requests for 20-25 people to numerous restaurants and Bluewater Grill was the first to reply (some did not reply for over a month) we discussed menu options, and opted for open menu, service was excellent, food was excellent, the experience was excellent, everyone including kids had an excellent time. Highly recommend them."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We had a fantastic meal tonight -- the food was great and the service even better. Definitely recommend.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Bluewater grill is a quintessential Santa Barbara spot - the location, ambience, food, drinks all scream Santa Barbara! A great place to impress out of town friends, a date, drinks with the girls, etc., etc.. 

Located on the corner of State and Cabrillo just across from the pier, you have a beautiful ocean view from the second floor patio. 

The fish, shrimp, scallops on the fisherman's platter were battered perfectly - not greasy at all. Caesar salad is offered with anchovies but you can ask for it without. The coffee ice cream dessert was so delightful - a must try!

Parking in this pier / funk zone area can be a bit difficult so make sure you plan ahead when heading to this area and expect to either pay for parking or walk from a street parking spot."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Got a 35/45 min wait for a table, which is about how long it took for us to find a parking spot in the area on lunch for valentines haha. 

Crab cakes were absolutely delicious, fresh and tasty. 

The lobster roll absolutely great, tad bit of lemon and it's perfect. 

Fish and chips was perfectly crisp and they had malt vinegar to go perfectly on the side

Cioppino was also delicious everything was cooked to perfection. 

The house made potato chips absolutely amazing. 

The customer service was amazing as well, they got all the sauces I needed, which I always love a variety of. Even cleaned the table up After we've finished everything and even offered a fresh glass of water."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I wish I had a better experience... i was really looking forward to some good seafood.  I ordered the cioppino that came out with a bad smell.  My husband ordered the fisherman's platter and I asked him to sub slaw, that he doesn't like, with scalloped potatoes. The platter was fine but the potatoes were basically baked potatoes in cream,  no salt or seasoning.  Couldn't even taste cheese.  My child had the cheese burger slider, that is actually a full sized buger, that was so well that the meat was crispy. The kids plate came with carrots that were cut in crooked and very thick rounds, rather than sticks, with ranch and grapes. Our server did swap out my meal for the germelli pasta with shrimp scallops, it was fine. She also brought out a small loaf of bread to tie me over. 

We got there at 4:15 on a Friday and it was already pretty busy. Our server was nice and tried to be attentive but it was just so busy, it seemed she was the only one working that patio... asked for my refill to be water but got another soda, asked for ice tea refill and it had no ice. Little things but for $100 meal + tip you'd just like a little better service."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Great location, great decor... bad service and blah food.  Red Lobster food quality at 5 star prices.  It's perfect for visitor and tourists but this local will not be going back.  I've dinned there twice and had apps in the bar once, so I think I've given them a fare shot a impressing me; they didn't.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait.  The hostesses are nice, but the wait staff are poorly trained and not friendly at all.  Items printed on the menu aren't always available and the waiter only informed me 30 minutes after ordering.  The food should be coming out, not telling me to look at the menu and start over.  There are too many great seafood places for locals to eat.... definitely avoid this place."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great place for a view and very good food.
The service was good but the waiter actually brought the wrong dish. It was so good but more pricey and more than I could eat but I enjoyed it anyways. 
We loved the atmosphere and sitting upstairs outside made our dinning extra special.
We would go back again for sure !"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Fabulous food and service!  Visited while on vacay and had a really enjoyable experience.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We came here in the summer time for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We had reservations but still had to wait a little bit. Unfortunately they were out of the appetizer we wanted (calamari) and the lobster roll. There wasn't any communication on this so we didn't find out until we tried to order. They had only been open for 2 hours at that point so that was disappointing. My boyfriend ended up getting the local swordfish which ended up being undercooked & cold to the touch in the middle. After sending it back we heard the table behind us do the exact same thing on the same piece of fish. Not sure what the issue was there but I recommend staying away from it. The cocktails were the highlight - super tasty & refreshing. Service was slow but we could tell the waitress was overwhelmed and there were a lot of issues with the food at different tables. Wouldn't come back here, for the cost I would rather try something new."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Unfortunately we did not enjoy our meal at Bluewater Grill.  The calamari was not hot. The fish didn't taste fresh.  Same with the cioppino.  The broth had good flavor but the seafood did not taste fresh.  The scallops were pretty good. But over all not the meal we hoped for.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We were visiting Santa Barbara  this week & feel in love with Bluegrill on East Cabrillo Ave. It faces the ocean and has a Beautiful outdoor patio with a Bar upstairs! The restaurant is clean, Beautiful & Classy.
The food was excellent!
My Favorite was Deep Fried Large Shrimp! Killer yummy. 
Great service also.
We will be back soon!
Thank you to the adorable waitress her name was Taylorshe did a GREAT JOB!
And I forget the hostess name that made our reservations twice, she was excellent and told us we could bring our doggy RUPERT with.
Made our dinner.

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,First time trying this place. It's right across from the ocean. They have patio sitting and you can bring your dog with you.  We tried the charbroiled octopus was superb. The clams were also delicious. The salad super fresh  staff was very efficient and friendly. We will definitely come back.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The Manager Colin is fabulous as is the food, the waiters, the menu EVERYTHING!!!! We loved it and we're going back soon! And they even have their own parking lot with a nice valet!

Today was my 2nd visit and 2nd incredible meal at Bluewater! Colin was amazing AGAIN and our waiter, Josh, is the best waiter in Santa Barbara; a thorough professional!!!! GOING BACK! 

My 3rd visit was even BETTER! The oysters are the best in Santa Barbara; The salmon caesar is just incredible! And every single staff member is friendly warm and incredibly helpful! These are the friendliest people outside of Disneyland! 

My 4th visit was BRILLIANT! Colin as always is the most gracious host you can find anywhere! Carlos is an incredible waiter- When he described the dishes I immediately felt hungry! It was my friend's birthday and everything was perfect!!!!!! Thank you guys!!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We had my grandmas 90th birthday celebration here not only were they super accommodating to our party but the staff was very friendly! Great service and food! They were very nice and fixed a meal when we told them about food allergies. I would recommend this place to anyone in visiting!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Made my Valentine's Day a memorable one! Very attentive staff, delicious food, and right next to the beach, would recommend."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Saturday night dinner located across the beach 
Reservation recommended- dining inside and outside available 

Parking not certain besides street parking to walk to it ..? 
Check in to restaurant located outside 

Service was very wonderful even with the miscommunication - questions were answered - check upon

Sirloin steak was ordered that was substituted with hangar steak came with scalloped potato, broccolini, and chimichurri sauce 
Steak cooked to request and chimichurri added additional
Flavor - scalloped potato could of used a bit more salt 

Seafood pasta contained baby scallops shrimp mushroom asparagus in a pesto sauce - besides missing shrimp good portion hit the spot for food

Lava cake was the hit of the show! Taste like a warm sticky toffee pudding!

Overall service was wonderful, food hit the spots, reasonable pricing, good to share things, date night, family place, and etc"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I love the restaurant structure, it looks like a light house. It is in a real good location. The food is great.  Oyster is fresh, salad is delicious. Grilled lobster is little bit over cooked. Service is ok, the waiter served us didn't pay attention to us sometimes, we have to call him couple times to get what we need. 
Overall,  we still enjoyed the food and time that we spent at Bluewater restaurant."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This restaurant has outdoor seating and it's right across the street from the beach which is why we chose giving it a try, we were there on Tuesday at about 4:30pm there was no one but us. Soon all the tables filled up, which was no surprise after we ate. The food was amazing cooked just right. We had the gemelli pasta (wow! Just perfect the pesto sauce was vey flavorful, the consistency was just right) and the swordfish was very tasty and paired well with the vegetables and rice. Service, was average but definitely will return whenever I am around Santa Barbara. 
A definite must try."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Make sure to make a reservation! I made a reservation for Saturday night and was sat immediately. It was freezing at night so maybe bring a blanket as they don't have that many heaters. Food was excellent. I got the pasta with scallops and shrimp. Our waitress was so kind and very attentive. Would go again!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Wow my 5th visit and the best food I have had in Santa Barbara in 18 years! REALLY! Blackened ahi and blackened swordfish- our waiter Chris was great and I just learned that the chef is a woman - Chanel and she is so talented and as always the Manager, Colin, makes everyone feel so welcomed and appreciated THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Food was bland. But overall good experience with the staff. All nice and friendly. The best part about dinner was the 1/2 white 1/2 red chowder. Everything else was overall just blah.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Loved it! We had dinner there some nights ago and due to covid we had to seat outside. The service was great and pretty quick. All the servers were super nice.

The food was sooo good. I love seafood so I had 2 appetizers because we are here just for a few days and I wanted to try both. The scallops were absolutely delicious and the mussels with pork belly also. The kids menu is also very nice, it comes in a Bento box with fruits and carrots, so it was perfect for my 4ys kid. 

And I mean, location!! Just in front of the pier. We had such a great time. Highly recommended!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Really beautiful place! Prime location right across the beach! Delicious food and reasonable prices!! I ordered half the menu!! Rockfish ceviche, Maryland crab cakes, bay oysters, lobster Mac and cheese, the clam chowder in a bowl which was prob my favorite, fish tacos and the lobster roll. I wasn't a fan on the lobster Mac and cheese.... crab cakes were very small but everything else was fantastic!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"For our anniversary weekend trip to Santa Barbara, we made a reservation for two adults and a toddler high chair two weeks prior to our vacation. We checked in at the front desk before our 6:15 pm reservation. The hostess pointed to the table where the customers had just paid which she would seat us at after they cleaned it off. 

We waited as the customers left and they cleaned the table. After waiting on the sidewalk for 20 minutes, after our three-year old got antsy for waiting around, after asking to be seated, we were told that the table was going to another party of five. 

One star is one more than they deserve. Collin doesn't know how to treat or talk to a customer. This place has horrible service. We won't be coming back. 

It's completely unacceptable to give away our table and make us wait 20 minutes after our reservation time. As customers, we deserve better treatment than that. We left for a very nice meal at Santa Barbara Fishouse."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The staff is hard working and very friendly. The management team has a constant floor presence and makes sure all customers are well cared for. To top it off, the food is delicious and the drinks are made to perfection. I highly recommend!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great priced happy hour menu. Food was ok. Service was good. Near the wharf and hotels.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Came this evening for SB Restaurant week We we're seated promptly and saw our server in short order and it went downhill from there. Our server arrived, took our drink order and came back with our wine. So far, so good. We placed our order and quickly got our chowder and then.....the long wait began. Over 30 minutes to get our dinner. No one stopped by to say anything..no server, no nothing! Finally dinner arrived. I had ordered steamed clams & mussels with broth. It arrived with a totally burnt piece of toast and yes, clams & mussels but no broth. The bottom of the pot was totally burned. The clams & mussels were salty and no sign of our server ...at all. Another 20 minutes went by and then our server appeared. We expressed our issues and he apologized and said that's the kind of night they were having. We paid our bill and received no discount for the badly prepared food. The server again said it was a bad night. As we were leaving we asked to speak with a manager. Ricardo said it was a bad night and they had been doing so well lately. He first offered a discount on our meal and then sort of forgot he was going to do that and he gave us his card so we'd get a discount next time. Really?!?! Next time? I don't think so."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Colin, the manager, reached out to offer his services. He not only provided a refund but also took care of a future dining experience. He exhibited professionalism at a very high degree and it was truly appreciated."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Normally love this place but today was horrible. 

We were seated for about 15 minutes without any help and dozens of waiters must have past us. 

Finally one of the bussers came by with ice water and walked away. 

Our waiter nick finally showed up to get our order.
From being in the industry, I love to have conversation with waiters whether it's about food, or just the restaurant in general. 

Nick seemed like he did not want to be here at all. He walked past us about 3 times after getting our entree, without any question about how the food was. 

We're fortunate that the food was delicious, and the surf n turf 14oz steak/lobster was outstanding. 

In total we had about two conversations with this waiter, and he was very short. 
A waiter says a lot about the restaurant since they're the face the consumer sees. 
Unfortunately he has given us a sore experience and we won't be coming back. I was able to type this up during the time it took for him to process our check."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Tourist trap! Run away as fast as you can! Left our name and phone number for a ""45 minute""  wait.  After close to an hour we were to that there was no record that ""sometimes their iPad swipes away"" the information. No apology. We waited again inside where the grime on the floor and stacked dishes and storage was in full view. Gross!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great outdoor dinning even during heat wave.

Great service, loved it. 

Steamed clam's were great, wife loved the louie salad delicious.


My fisherman's platter was great...."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Food was mediocre staff was terrible! Doesn't seem like management cares either. Food was lukewarm our waitress didn't check on us after our food got to the table so we were unable to get the napkins we needed. Also, they need to clean the tables a little better after each guest."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This is our second time dining at Bluewater and it confirmed that we'll be back again. The scallops with risotto are fabulous. You won't have one gritty, sandy bite, guaranteed. The sea bass is delicious. Pasta lovers - don't think twice. The gemelli is to die for. Try to sit outside upstairs. The view is gorgeous. Locals, use your Axxess card! And if you're lucky enough to have Carlos as your waiter, you are blessed! You will not be disappointed by your drinks and dinner and Bluewater! Give Carlos a bonus!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Food here is very mediocre. We tried about 6-7 different things and nothing to write home about.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"After reading about this hot new restaurant in SB, I decided to give it a try. Situated conveniently at the corner of State & Cabrillo, it is shaped like a lighthouse & from the upstairs patio, you are treated to nice views of the ocean. From the inside, it looks like a trendy modern restaurant with nice decor & a big noisy bar scene. We opted instead to dine on the patio & enjoy the views. Although you're sandwiched between many other tables on the patio in chairs that were not the most comfortable, more reminiscent of a fish and chip fast food place than a classy seafood restaurant, we didn't mind it due to the beautiful weather & ocean view. The service by the waiter, Ariana & one of the hostesses was very good. As another yelper indicated, I don't understand the purpose of having 2 hostesses sitting at the front desk greeting you when a different lady comes by & takes you to your table.  
The wine selection (being mostly from the area) & food were good. For the appetizer, I took the server's recommendation of the raw scallops with wasabi. It was quite good, but one of the scallops was a bit slimy & runny. (We'll get back to that later!) For the entrée, I had the grilled yellowtail which was caught that day according to our server. It tasted very fresh, although a little on the bland side. I had it with the scalloped potatoes & brussell sprouts, which were excellent. 
Later that night, my stomach became very upset. It turns out that the runny slimy scallop did not agree with it. After waking up from a restless night being violently ill from the tainted scallops, I contacted the restaurant to let them know. The receptionist apologized & told me that the manager should be giving me a call that night, which never happened.  I found this to be very rude. I don't believe customers should be treated in this manner & would probably not patronize this establishment again given the glut of choices in the area."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,First time here. My husband and I ordered the halibut and swordfish. Both dishes were not seasoned enough so it was a bit bland. We ordered a dozen oysters and we were short a couple. Also my husband ordered a dirty martini and he was brought a regular martini so that was also taken back. The location is by the wharf so it was nice place to eat outdoors.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Very nice place for dinner. My wife and I highly recommend it. Great food, great atmosphere, and especially great service. And by service, I mean they would let you borrow their chargers for your phones. The Crab and Artichoke dip was divine, Salads large enough to share for 2 people, and great Chocolate Lava cake melted in your mouth. Taylor was a great host. Ask for her if possible. Would come here again and their other locations."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We stopped on our way from Santa Cruz to Santa Monica. This was my favorite meal on our trip so far. Everyone had a great meal and the ambiance can fit pretty much any occasion. Highly recommend!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Amazing place to dine. Family friendly. Restroom and dinning room are very clean. Great drinks, Carlos our server gave us great service and was on top of everything. From drinks  to dessert. The chipotle swordfish is definitely a fish you have to try. Colin the GM makes sure his staff is very professional when taking care of their guests. Will definitely come back here and i definitely recommend it."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came here for a birthday brunch with a large group of friends. The service was outstanding (which is especially impressive considering there were 15 of us) and the food was delicious. 

I recommend getting there early so that you can get seated on the balcony upstairs, it has a beautiful view of the beach and pier."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Loud,service at bar crazy.  They rush around and waste lots of energy.  ( Sunday night ).  Food was good until the little bug was floating on it.  Didn't even get an apology, just an explanation about a contact lens.  I would not return"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place was so good and the staff  so friendly that we came back the next night just to have aa drink in the upstairs bar. My first trip here we split the Ponzu scallops...to die for! If u love sushi and you love scallops, you will not be disappointed.  The scallops were fresh, the ponzu  sauce and ginger were perfect with them.  We sat on the upstairs balcony looking out at the beautiful Pacific Ocean on a sunny Friday afternoon and enjoyed fantastic service. The manager, Collin, checked on us to make sure we were happy with everything and we absolutely were, no complaints whatsoever. 

They make a very refreshing cocktail called Tequila Time or something like that which actually has absinthe in which sounds gross but trust me, these go down way too easy! I had a glass of Prosecco to start but my  companion had that drink and I was completely wowed by it. 

They serve fresh hot sourdough bread with your food, water on request per Santa Barbara regulations. This is great seafood restaurant so if you love seafood and you're in Santa Barbara, you must check this place out! 

Oh and btw, when you check in on Yelp here, they give you 50% off one of your cocktails! Talk about fantastic!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Loved it, best happy hour and ambience in town. Service is friendly and welcoming. The seafood Cioppino is a must with linguini"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great food and service. Swordfish is super fresh. Fisherman's platter is great too. Highly recommend!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Service was incredible. We didn't have a reservation and also had a puppy with us. I let them know there was no rush and i understood that not having a reservation and a puppy isn't always easy to accommodate. They hostess and a waiter (sad to forget their names), immediately cleared us a table on the rooftop outdoors. We were checked in on constantly to make sure our drinks were full, and let us know how long until our foods come out. Many waiters and waitresses came up to see my puppy which some people don't like, but I love! Made great conversation with any staff that came to our table and were treated like vip. I got a glass of Chardonnay and the filet. Not the best I've ever had, but the service made it an amazing experience. Not to mention the views from the rooftop are positively stunning. Pretty crowded upstairs outside, so i wouldn't recommend for a big group. Thank you staff for the excellent service! Will definitely be coming back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Stumbled upon this place and it looked so great that we made a rezzo next day for brunch ! Which did not dissapoint ... From the ocean views to the fresh seafood to the bottomless mimosas to the great service and super cute decor...This place was a total hit on our trip. The scallops are delish !! As is the avocado crab toast ,and yummmm the crab artichoke dip... and their Rosé from local winery Margerum, dry and crisp. Bookmark this !"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Fantastic dining experience with the family.  We had a great outdoor dining social distancing. Wonderful evening view of the ocean and pier, kept warm by the flame heaters. 

Kids had a blast thanks to their well crafted kids meal and desserts.  The grab dip was absolutely fantastic though the home made chips scraped up our palate afterwards.  

The 11oz Lobster Tail was fantastic! Their spiny lobster tail was sparkling in taste, very  juicy and had the perfect texture. It is well worth the price and tasted way better than any Maine lobster. 

Restaurant staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, the architecture and location of Blue Water is fantastic. Definitely worth the trip and we will visit again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The food was ok and the view was cool, but the service was so unbelievably egregious that I had no choice but to do this. There were five independent events that collided to produce the perfect storm of cringe. 

1. Waiter spilled a cocktail on my fiancé's lap and didn't say a single word about it besides ""oops"". My jaw dropped to the floor. Not only was his vocabulary limited to the word ""oops"" for seemingly 30 seconds, but somehow, with all the time he saved by not saying anything, he didn't choose to do ANYTHING about it. Didn't help clean up. Didn't offer additional napkins. Nothing. Crickets. 

2. As waiter made his way to our table, he dropped an entree on the ground. Then the food runner (we hypothesized that his name was Grayson) went out of his way to blame waiter for dropping it. Here's an idea: how about we create a restaurant where everyone saves their in-fighting for the kitchen and not the customers? No? Not a good idea? Ok noted. 

3. When the second iteration of the previously grounded entree was finally brought out, it was the wrong dish. I legitimately laughed out loud when it was set down.

4. While the third iteration of the previously grounded entree and previously erroneous entree was being prepared waiter brings me a cup of clam chowder. I told him I don't eat dairy, so I couldn't eat it. On my mother's life, he said ""You know...anybody at the table can eat it."" THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ENLIGHTENING WISDOM. Do you moonlight as some Noble Prize-winning philosophical author? If not, then you honestly should. 

5. He completely forgot to add one of our appetizers. When the bill came I asked if the appetizer he didn't bring out was on the bill. He looked at the bill and goes ""Nah, you're good."" The hilarity of this statement is two-fold. First, he didn't even apologize or acknowledge his mistake. Whooshed right over his head like when I ordered the long-forgotten appetizer. Second, he said it as if he was doing us a favor. Like when you offer to pay for something and you're friend goes ""Nah, you're good!"" That's how this man said those words to me lollll. 

In sum, I wasn't absolutely positive this was the worst service I've ever received in my life, but after writing all this out now I am absolutely positive. Whoever controls hiring and staff management/maintenance: do better. Good night and good luck."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I frequent the one by our place in Newport Beach and had to give this one a try while in the area. It's really hard to give a fair review during this COVID season as I'm sure things would have been different under normal operations but I think this is a fair rating considering all the above.
Key positive and negative points:
Serrano Margarita was deliciously spicy but a little watered down. 
Salmon was cooked to perfection. The sauce is always delicious. A bit on the pricey side.
My tap water was gross. Service was not bad. 
Definitely a little weak on the hospitality/service side compared to other 5 star restaurants. 
Give it a try for yourself!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Really nice place for a date night. It was pretty busy so the service was okay. The food was really good. I'd recommend the scallop sashimi appetizer.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great food. We ordered the fresh market fish: Salmon and Halibut. Both were very satisfying. The salmon was brought out burnt, but the server quickly changed it out for new one. We also ordered a local Santa Barbara white wine, which was very crisp and refreshing. 

There was a line to get a seat, but they were able to get  our party of four seated within 5 minutes.

Cheers."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,The restaurant was packed.  The food was outstanding and Sean our waiter was great. Made some great suggestions which we did. He knew the menu and made it an outstanding experience. The busboy was always there taking our dirty plates and filling our water. Everyone needs to try Bluewater and ask for Sean.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Horrible service here. Made a reservation, got seated and then waited about 20 minutes for our server. The seats and tables were dirty. The next table over, a party of about 6-7 people sat down and the server went right to them and took their drink and app orders. Turns out he was our server too.  It wasn't even busy but apparently a party of 2 gets neglected to tend to a larger party. The table next to us sat down about 20 minutes after and got taken care of immediately. By the time they got their orders in, the ice in our water had melted and we didn't even get to order drinks. When we finally did get to place an order for drinks, they delivered it to the wrong table. We had to tell them that it was for us. The food was fine. Not horrible but not great. I would say it's reasonably priced for the location. The server pathetically tried to make us laugh before handing us The bill at the end of the meal so we could forget about the bad service. Too bad, that didn't work! We definitely will not be returning."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We had the snapper with chimichurri sauce and a cheeseburger and fries. Both were great! The menu is limited from normal. Tables were spaced apart safely and the atmosphere/view was prefect!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Went there for lunch. The three of us ordered fish taco and cup of clam chowder. Two of us thought the clam chowder tasted Smokey and one of us thought they burned it. The fish taco was not tasty. The fish was dry and there wasn't any sauce on it.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The manager reached out and apologized. He assured us the food (specifically the dip) is made fresh daily. This is pretty hard to believe since the sheer amount of mold that was found would never occur on freshly prepared food. He offered to treat us to dinner to prove the freshness however when we took him up on the offer he stopped replying. For days. Then surprisingly once we are out of Santa Barbra he suddenly reached out and apologized ""his messages were never sent"". Obviously the offer to show us his restaurant actually uses fresh food was disingenuous and was a feeble attempt to make up for the disgusting food they serve."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"First, the food was excellent. My friends claimed that it was the best fish they've ever had and I really enjoyed the salad and the fresh sourdough bread.

However, the service left a lot to be desired. While sitting there, we had the impression that we were thought of as inferior to the other patrons who looked noticeably different to my friends and me. The restaurant was not full by any means: apart from our table, there were maybe three other occupied tables. Yet, after the waiter had taken our order, no one approached us to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything. The waiter had also told us that he will bring out some bread while we wait for our food, but the bread did not arrive until the main dishes were brought out (and when we mentioned this, a waitress cheekily remarked, ""oh, then perfect timing""). After that, none of the waiters approached us for the rest of our meal, but were very obviously interacting with and checking up on the other customers. I wanted more bread but there was no one around for me to ask. In addition, once we were done eating, we waited a long time for someone to bring us the cheque and we ended up just walking over to the front desk to pay. While paying, we informed them about our pleasant satisfaction with the food and immense dissatisfaction with the service, but the person listening to our criticism was either unaware of how to respond to criticism or was simply unconcerned about it. Either way, we did not have a good experience at this restaurant and the two stars are solely for the food."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,We stopped in here for a late lunch/happy hour. We ordered a bunch of food. We couldn't finish it and took a bunch of it back to the hotel and put it into our fridge. Later that day we started feeling a little ill. The entire night we were throwing up and barely made it up the next morning. I opened up the containers in the morning and was greeted by some mold on the blue crab artichoke dip. When I put the dip into the container I flipped it which means that mold was there when they served us. My shrimp sliders also had mold in them! This place is a health hazard. Seafood restaurants need to extra careful with the freshness of their food and obviously this place is one to stay far away from. Thanks for ruining our anniversary trip!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"On our drive back to LA from skydiving we stopped by this restaurant. It was a Saturday night and we didn't had a reservation. The restaurant was busy but they were able to accomodate us right away. Food was delicious, service was very fast, and prices were fair. Loved this place!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The ambiance and service was nice but I had the most bland fish tacos of my life from the happy hour menu... dry, tasteless, pretty darn terrible."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Absolutely beautiful location and great staff I loved Dani she was helpful, sweet, prompt and her service really pushed our experience over the edge from awesome to absolutely incredible. 
You def have to try the shrimp tacos and a Bloody Mary !"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place is a dream. I love the service here and yes, they can be a bit pushy about ordering more. The view is fantastic, furniture and seating are great!

The food is absolutely delicious. Almost worth the overpriced valet. haha

I highly recommend this place for the view, food, and vibe!

Cheers"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This place has great food with an amazing view from the deck.  Highly recommended!  Great seafood options.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"As much as I wanted to love this place unfortunately my Cioppino had something ""extra"" in it and ruined it for me. The flavors was ok, I've had better in San Francisco. The waiter was great took care of the issue right away. The front staff was pleasant as well."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"First of all, service is top notch here. The food was average, my boyfriend and I work in the service industry and were expecting better quality but the service is the only reason I'm writing this review. We were visiting from LA and work in fish houses and weren't impressed. Great location though, we may return if we're back in the area."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Channel the Chef outstanding cook! Aoutat from Egypt was our server. Terrific service awesome dinner. 5 stars. Worth the long wait
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I here since 2 month and it's the best restaurant in town. Nice food, nice service team (they don't come every 5min asking if everything's ok!!). I recommand !"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"This place was a complete waste of time. The food was not worth the price. My wife ordered the lobster tail and it was over cooked, gum took less time to chew. I ordered mahi mahi and it was also over cooked and not cut neatly. The lemon caper beurre blanc sauce was not good. I did not order it and it was slopped over the dish, I would not have ordered this and the server did not ask what sauce I wanted with it. The server could tell that we were upset and we sent the food away not even half eaten and he did not ask why or what was wrong with the food. When he came back to pick up the check he actually rolled his eyes at me and was very rude to us. Do not waste your time or money on this place. Also I witnessed another server picking up an order, it was oysters on a half shell and he picked up the middle one and spilled it on the plate and still proceeded to serve it, all this was done this not gloves on and he ended up licking his fingers."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Excellent food and service. Raya (Spelling?) was a ray of sunshine. The scallop appetizer was excellent.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Absolutely the best food by the water in Santa Barbara! We been twice and every time it's been the best. I've done both times the Bluewater surf
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,The food is good and the staff is really nice. The views our stunning! I recommend this to everyone!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Worst meal I've ever had out in SB. I should have sent it back.  I've had sanddabs many times - at Lure... the whole meal was extremely bland.  It was like the whole fish, potato, spinach was frozen from a pouch and reheated.  The fish was very soggy, flavorless laying on the top of the flavorless potatoes, which made them even more soggy.  The spinach was like out of a can - absolutely no flavor.  We all used to meet up at Bluewater when they first opened - and my friends and I never go anymore.  Thought I would give it another shot - it's too bad as the location is awesome.  Gave 2 stars as the waitress was very nice and attentive (she asked about the oysters but not about my meal).  The oysters were good."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This is our first experience at Bluewater Grill. Their hospitality, service and attention to detail was fun amazing and perfessonial.  Food prepared to your liking.  Good size portions. Beautiful views"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The food was ok. The service was really horrible. Combination of the kitchen and the waiter not
Coming back to check on us. They tried to make it better and give us a significant discount. Would not recommend and would not come back. Too many options here."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Unfortunately there is a huge mismatch between what you think this place should be and the actual food. It is overpriced and bland. The lobster frittata was over cooked and had no flavor. Our server had his mask below his nose which is unacceptable during a pandemic. It's probably better if you order the bottomless mimosas
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Wasn't the greatest place I've been to. The service was friendly but it took like three servers to finally get us some bread that was supposed to be there a while ago. Wouldn't really really recommend this place unless you're looking for plain tasting food and slow service.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Food was ok. Ordered the scallop skewers and one out of my two skewers was missing scallops other than that my husbands ""green"" rice was hard and undercooked. A friend ordered the spicy margarita and said ""I like spicy but this margarita is to hot -it's like they hate you!"" Oysters were good. Restaurant looks great had a nice ambience just wished they put more details into their food since it is very pricey. Will not return."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We went to the Bluewater Grill on Memorial Day for dinner without a reservation.  The staff appeared worn out from the busy holiday weekend.  The hostess was nice and sat us upstairs at the bar.  After 15 minutes we realized the bartender and the wait staff were not even slightly acknowledging our presence there.  We got up and went back downstairs.  We mentioned the issue to the hostess and she apologized for the staff.  She sat us this time in the downstairs dining room.  Our server was excellent and provided friendly and efficient service.  Our salads and fish entrees were very tasty and offered a satisfying portion of seafood and vegetables.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The Manager Colin is fabulous as is the food, the waiters, the menu EVERYTHING!!!! We loved it and we're going back soon! And they even have their own parking lot with a nice valet!

Today was my 2nd visit and 2nd incredible meal at Bluewater! Colin was amazing AGAIN and our waiter, Josh, is the best waiter in Santa Barbara; a thorough professional!!!! GOING BACK! 

My 3rd visit was even BETTER! The oysters are the best in Santa Barbara; The salmon caesar is just incredible! And every single staff member is friendly warm and incredibly helpful! These are the friendliest people outside of Disneyland! I'm going back next week"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"It's been an interesting run for this unique property on the SB waterfront. From Keepers Lighthouse restaurant (meh) to Rusty's pizza which despite their laudable affection for cool buildings was still just pretty good pizza,and now to Bluewater Grill. I'm quite happy to say the Bluewater is by far the best of the lot. Now, as a local, the waterfront is not generally the first place that comes to mind for dining. No offense to anyone or any establishment but the SB food scene is much more known for its hidden gems and neighborhood favorites. Back on point Bluewater did us quite a solid when we dined there on a busy Mother's Day Sunday eve. We were seated promptly and it didn't take long at all for us to have drinks in hand, and good ones to boot. And if you get nothing else out of this review, file this tidbit away in your head. No Corkage Fee!!!  We had brought a bottle of our own for dinner ( though they have a serviceable wine selection) and we were very pleasantly surprised to find that there was no corkage fee. Amazing and quite unusual in SB. Anyhow, the place was hoppin and management coulda/shoulda had at least one maybe 2 more staff on hand to handle the throngs. That said our server was awesome and never missed a beat even though she seemed to be covering at least half of the room :-). One thing about the waterfront and Bluewater is that you can't beat the view. We enjoyed a beautiful scenic of the pier and the park area just east of it, you do t get that in the Funk Zone. Food wise they have an excellent selection of fish and seafood of all types ( no surprise) but there's also a couple of steaks and burgers on the menu as well. I actually had the Prime top sirloin and is was delicious. I'd have never known I was at a seafood joint if it weren't for the mounds of mussel, scallop and other shells piling up on our table from the rest of my crews dishes  :-) Anyhow. Bluewater Grill is an excellent place and it really doesn't matter if your a tourist or a local the place is solid all around. Food, drinks location, they've got the whole thing going on. Give em a try"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Ok so I'll start off by saying the food was really good, all our food came out very quickly and very hot  (we ordered the halibut with the Mediterranean sauce, fingerling potatoes with bacon, and seasonal veggies and fish and chips). But the reason for two stars was the service, it was awful. I ordered a bottle of Auqua panna for my son and I, my son is 3 so we needed a cup for him that wasn't a wine glass. It took our waiter until our meal was almost half gone to bring it. We were told 3 times by him that he was going to be bringing us bread which never came. And then when we were finished we had to ask for our check after not being checked on at all throughout our meal. Then we proceeded to wait for over 10 min for our check while we could see our waiter drying dishes and EATING PIE behind the bar! I've literally never seen a waiter eat while working within view of all in the restaurant. (We were seated upstairs next to the bar) finally my husband had to call attention to the waiter and ask for our check again! We had two small children with us (who were very quiet and well behaved the whole time) but after waiting for that long at our table both were getting fussy. Probably some of the worst service we've had, which was such a disappointment considering how beautiful this restaurant is and how good the food was. This waiter might be more suited as a busser."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This place is EXCELLENT! Looking for a great seafood dish you've gone to the right place! The seared scallops have me feeling something I haven't felt in years
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,The place is very nice with great views. The upstairs bar is the best. The service was okay and the food well I can't judge since I'm not a fan of seafood but I'm sure it was good. The people I was with said the pasta was delicious. We were outside and got a lot of sun so I wish the umbrellas could bend a bit. I got the crab cakes and they are small...well it is an appetizer so I get it but don't plan on sharing with more thank 2 people. The desserts are very good!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Was at Costco and they were offering $100.00 in gift cards for $74.99. Wanted to take my daughter and her family out for her birthday, we had never eaten nor heard of this restaurant and they live in Santa Barbara so I thought we would give it a try.  It was a fantastic deal.

Boy, what a GREAT experience.  There were 5 in our party 3 adults and two toddlers.  The receptionist/hosts were fantastic and made sure we were sat right away (I did make a reservation, knowing this time of year is busy in Santa Barbara).  The service was impeccable, the waitress (Maegan) was fantastic, she was there at every instance making sure we had everything we needed.  The bus boys/assistants to servers were right on top of everything, constantly replenishing the wonderful warm sourdough bread and filling out glasses of water constantly.  Removing our plates to make room for the main course, etc.

The food was excellent, I had the Sea Bass which I love.  I had asked Maegan how they cook it and she had said they normally grill it, but she suggested it be sauteed with lemon and capers and that is my favorite way to have Sea Bass.  The portions were generous in size and we were very full to say the least.  My daughter had just an appetizer for dinner, but it looked wonderful and she really enjoyed it.  My son-in-law enjoyed his scallops and even the kids ate all of their meals.  Overall, I would say it was a very successful meal, including the delicious desserts.  A hot fudge sundae to celebrate the birthday girl, with candle intact and a piece of delicious mud pie for anyone who wanted something different.  Yummy!!!

I would definitely suggest this restaurant if you are looking for a fair priced, excellent service and fantastic quality of food type of place to have a meal.

The total bill was reasonable and the view was also another big plus.

Will definitely visit again in the near future."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Absolutely amazing staff especially, Jerry,  Ian and Nancy.  This is how everyone should uphold themselves as it makes a difference.  My mum and I just went in to get a drink before we went back to our room due to the excellent service we decided we would come back for dinner the next night.  Got to sit out on the patio with the fantastic view.  I got the whole fish (head and tail on) never had that before it was the Ortega fish (never heard if that either) I am one for trying something once and I am glad I did.  It was fantastic.  My mum got the bluewater burger that came with a slice of beetroot, a fried egg and homemade chips, she loved the burger.  They made it without the bun as she is gluten free, even offered to lettuce wrap it.  Our waiter was very attentive also.  Definitely a place to go.  Love this restaurant."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Went there Friday for lunch, ordered the clam chowder the half and half, it was served like warm. I had it two weeks prior and it was hot. 
My entree was the fisherman's platter, 
The 2 shrimp were over cooked, the scallops, were also over cooked, on the menu it just saids scallops, but they were tiny bay scallops. And 2 pieces of fish. The fish were good. If it would have said bay scallops I wouldn't have ordered it. My meal also came with home style chips, which weren't very good. 
My husband ordered fish , which came as a whole fish on the plate, the waiter said it was some kind of sea bass. My husband wasn't to happy with his meal either. So for over 100 for lunch, and we did not have alcohol, I would have to say this is over priced for what you get. 
They'll have to do a lot better then that. To keep customers coming back. 
The view is the best thing there."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I love that they have no corkage fee! Most of their food has been good. Once I paid extra for the ""farm fresh veggies "" which came out absolutely burnt off the grill. Other than that though, the service is friendly and the atmosphere is great."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Damn. I love this restaurant. Great food, great staff, cutest building and interior, & great wine.  100% will eat here again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Worst service I've ever received.  We've been to the Redondo Beach and Newport Beach Blue Water's, but we will never return to this one.  
First, they gave alcohol to my son.  DID NOT CARD HIM!  Isn't that against the law!?!  He ordered an oyster shot. On the menu, it has 'oyster shot' $3 and under it with a shot of vodka (in smaller letters) $5.  He takes it and starts gagging and turning red.  After checking his glass and my other sons oyster shot, it had vodka.  I go to the counter to bring this issue up with the manager and he basically hovers over me and says ""that's the way they're made!.""  Do they take the vodka out after a minor or someone else who doesn't want alcohol and asks.  I point to the menu and it clearly say oyster shot, by itself.  He then looks at me and says, ""what are you asking for sir!""   Really.  That is the response to a complaint?  Did not apologize first.  No personality, no compassion.  What do you want me to do!   

Secondly, the waiter rollers his eyes when my older son decides on a different dish because they don't make it the same way they do at the Redondo Beach restaurant.  Rolls his eyes.  Are we back in grade school.  Then he mixes up orders, get 2 orders wrong and forgets my older sons order.   

My older son And my wife order Arnold Palmers and he comes back and tells my younger son, who didn't order it, that they were out of lemonade.   Never told us they ran out of lemonade.  Finally my older son orders a coke and the waiter never brought it.  

The only bright spot of this whole ordeal was the helper Justin.   He actually came to assist and make up for the waiters lack. 

I also noticed the manager greeting and saying bye to customers as they were leaving.  When we were getting ready to leave, he walked away.  Never apologized.  How sad.  And they actually added gratuity on the check.  I alway tip very good...this time I did it for one of my worst experiences in a restaurant. 

Update:

The owner actually reached out to us and the district Manager Deanna.  They apologized and invited us back.  I appreciate them taking the time to make things right."

zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We came in as a large party of 11.  Everyone ordered something different   All dishes  came out within 4 minutes of each other. Everything was fabulous   Great taste lovely presentation. Servers Taylor and Angel were top notch. Manager came around to check on us 
Very pleases and will certainly return for more!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great location that can see the beach and beach walk. The whole fish is great and impressive. The seafood in Cioppiano are not very fresh and small.

The waitresses are friendly and the kids meals are decent. We enjoyed our family dinner there."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Delicious appetizers lead to a very disappointing meal overall. The scallop sashimi and crab dip were both very enjoyable-- friendly service at the bar. We then received an entirely overcooked steak and a salad with a hair in it as our entrees. Felt like money and an evening of vacation misspent.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My family and I ate here for my 50th bday and it was great! Lovely outdoor seating, perfect location with a great view of the water, fun atmosphere and great drinks!  Menu has a huge selection and everyone loved the dish they ordered! Staff was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Place closes at 8pm on a Tuesday which is really strange for a restaurant in California. At 7:45 they got a surplus of new customers which seemed overwhelming for the waiter. He skipped on some key details like when my mother ordered another class of wine. Food was good, not great."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Hmmm wow what to say about this place. Very expensive. Service was good.  But honestly it's just too expensive. Sure the portions were decent.  But a friend and I ordered an app and an entree each.  We brought our own wine which the guy comped the fee because my friend worked at the winery and the bill was still super hefty. We had to send a vegetable dish back because it tasted like plastic.  I'm not saying I hated this place but I just think for what we payed we could have gone somewhere better.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"So for those of you looking for beautiful views, great atmosphere and amazing seafood all rolled into one......this is your place!! Upstairs bar and patio are a great place to enjoy the sunset, followed by the open kitchen downstairs. Not only serving great cocktails and appetizers but the food here is amazing!  Paired with some very smooth and delightful wines from the Monterrey region. Absolutely love the vibe here and staff were great!! After words take a nice long walk along the the beach just across the street"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I just dined at Bluewater Grill for the first time.  Wow, sand dabs were so yummy. So yummy!  Our waitress, Danny was very attentive and we were impressed with the service.  Such a great find!  
A young guy named Gil came by in between our server's visits to see if we needed anything too. We were extremely impressed with food and service. We'll be coming back!!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Can't speak of the food as we were never seated. Wasted over an hour waiting for a table to not be seated. One excuse after another. If they werent able to seat a party of 13 they should not have taken our name in the first place. Would have appreciated the truth rather than the run around. We even had to let other waiting customers know they were seating people ahead of them who just walked in. Glad someone was able to eat tonight. Definitely not returning ever. Luckily we were able to be seated right away next door at FisHouse who appreciated our patronage.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Had a great time there! Friendly staff, good view, We sat at the bar, ask for special of the day! 
Will be back next time on our way home from wine tasting :)"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The food was delicious. I ordered an 11 ounce lobster tail and when it was served, it seemed bigger than 11 ounces. My wife was not very hungry and ordered a fruit salad, it was enough for two.

The service was excellent and the view of the ocean made dining a pleasure. Anytime we spend a night in Santa Barbara, this will be our go to restaurant for dinner."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great place to head to for a night on the town. Go dressed up or go casual, you'll feel at home. Due to the location you may think it's a tourist trap but this restaurant brings good food and ambience. I've visited with a large group and when it was just my husband and myself. Both occasions I've enjoyed my food choices but also wanted to steal the dish of my dining companions were eating. I really appreciate a seafood restaurant that works with local vendors (from seafood to the wine list) and offers substantial dishes at a price I can not argue with. I also love you can customize your own plate by picking and choosing your protein and sides. The staff is pretty fun as well. When I asked where the best photo for instagram was they were more than happy to show off their space and give recommendations.

Can specifically recommend the Ponzu Sashimi sea scallops, Manhattan clam chowder, Gumbo, and Roasted Heirloom Cauliflower.

Also, that Java Mud Pie tho. Big enough to share, but not required."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"First timer here and wouldn't recommend this place for a nice dinner. Average food, staff was not attentive, and OK ambiance. We ordered multiple items from the clam chowder soup, gemelli pasta (creamy and watery, bland), calamari (was in bits and pieces, not chunks), grilled octopus (not bad) and etc. We had a party of 12 ladies and 2 out of 12 in our party was satisfied with our meal. Our waiter walks by multiple times without checking in or replenishing our drinks/waters. We had to flag down the hostess for service. Not cool. He even gave us a smirk for asking for more bread. Really? There are plenty of other great seafood choices within walking distance of this restaurant, so I'd highly recommend you check one of those out before you waste your time and money here."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Lovely fish. All of it but be sure you don't sit near the bar. The bar flies were loud and obnoxious right near tables where we were trying to eat our meal. They were drinking too much and oblivious to where they were. Servers could not pass by them. Spoiled an otherwise really great fish dinner on a Friday night. 
I had sole and my husband got sand dabs because they ran out of snapper but what a good thing as the sand dabs were tender and moist and delicious!  They also had run out of bread but really who needs the carbs?  Anxious enough to have dessert and hope the dudes at the bar disappear soon!  Please!  Waiter was great and offered to move us. Too late!  Move them!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Had an excellent meal and experience here. Great location, first off.

The menu is large and filled with a ton of great options - mainly seafood and great apps for sharing a little bit of everything. 

Cocktails were great. The serrano one is spicy! 

Service was on point."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Perfect spot if you enjoy some great seafood. This place is awesome, and the food was delightful and the prices were very affordable. Rapidly, efficient service and very amiable waiters."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Bluewater Grill has an ideal location across the street from the beach and a block away from State Street. Significant outdoor seating available with heat lamps to keep customers warm. Surprisingly had the ability to walk-in on a Friday night without reservations. Staff was rapid with service and accommodating by substituting clam chowder rather than fries as a side dish with our meal. Food was fresh, but slightly cold. Bread was over cooked and rock hard. Restaurant lacked the extra touches that would have made this dining experience more memorable, such as explaining what type of oysters were served, being more familiar with wine menu, and making recommendations. Pricey for the overall experience."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"After a long day of bike riding, my husband and I decided to stop in for dinner. We were sold on the Mussels with Pork Belly. The creamy white wine broth was heavenly! I wanted to swim in that broth, that's how amazing the flavors of this dish was. If we hadn't ordered other dishes, I would have gotten another serving. Moral of the story - Get the Mussels!

We also ordered the Seared Scallops with Bacon Jam. Bacon Jam has been on my radar lately, so I definitely wanted to try it. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They were tender, succulent, and the flavors were refreshing to my taste buds.

We shared an entree because we figured we were ordering way too much food, and I'm so glad we did. The New York Steak was 14 oz and was more than enough to feed the both of us. This juicy steak was served with creamy scalloped potatoes and sauteed spinach. It was the perfect ending to our meal. 

I will definitely come back again - and I really hope they still have the Mussels with Pork Belly!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I really enjoyed this restaurant! In Santa Barbara most restaurants are pretty pricey however for the quality of the food and the portion and prices are amazing!

I had the shrimp kebabs with with bell pepper and onions grilled! Usually I need to squeeze a lot a limit on shrimp so you don't taste the fishing is however the way the season and the shrimp was amazing! The flavor of the shrimp was delicious and it tasted very fresh! The flavor of the shrimp was delicious and it tasted very fresh!I got the homemade chips which were so amazing! Just a little warning if you're on a diet do not have them because they were white greasy!

My boyfriend had the lobster roll however he liked my shrimp a lot better! The portion of the sandwich was quite small and we recommend that you actually get a meal rather than a sandwich because the portions are a lot bigger.

I recommend you go back to this restaurant and make sure you sit outside because it's a beautiful view!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The ambiance and venue were great. Food was ok nothing special but the service by the waiter (Jordan)was terrible! He had no manners. Slammed my glass of red wine down on the table nearly spilling it  and did not even apologize. Then he asked us what we wanted to order in a rude way as if we owe him something. Clearly, he is not meant to be in the hospitality industry. Worst service I've had in a long time! We will never return to this restaurant again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The location of this place is perfect. We got parking close by and were excited to see it busy but not packed. We are from the midwest and were looking forward to a good fush meal. We got seated right away but our server was very rushed. I flustered him with my yelp coupon, I guess. The bread we had was delicious as was the margarita and wine we ordered. My friend and I shared a meal and got the shrimp scallop skewer dinner. We had seasonal veggies on the side and roasted carrots. Out of all those items, the carrots won hands down. 

The seafood was flavorless and overall the experience was completely overpriced. If you're looking for great seafood, this place is probably not where you'll find it

 Of course, it could have been an off night. Either way, not likely to go back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Had a reservation last night at 8:30pm, got there around 8:40pm. As soon as we were seated we were told that the kitchen is closing and we have only 10 min to order. They said no worries about staying late, it's just the kitchen that's closing. We ordered oysters and shrimp as appetizers, and a pasta dish and crab cakes as main dishes. less than 10 min later, ALL our food came out. We are confused why our main dishes were out already, and the waiter said they will take them back and keep them warm for us. It seemed like this os normal procedure at this restaurant. As soon as we finished our appetizer, they brought out our warmed up main dishes, which were mediocre. Around 9:20pm, they very obviously started to close out the restaurant, putting chairs away, etc. see picture. They kept checking in with us to see if we're done. We ended up leaving less than an hour from sitting down. This was a terrible experience!!! Here's my recommendation: don't give out reservations at 8:30pm when you're closing at 9pm."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I loved the food. It tasted very fresh and succulent. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing. The waiter, Gregg, was very courteous and professional. He made great recommendations to order the best tasting food.  The prices reasonable for the freshness of the foods.  I would recommend that if you want to sit and eat at this location, you make sure the hostesses get your name on the waiting list. I showed up and and ask for a table for two, my husband was parking, I was told that we both needed to be present in order to get a table. The hostess did not take down my name and I didn't think I needed to tell her. But when my husband showed up she said that there was a 30-45 minutes wait.  I didn't complain because I was ver hungry, but she made me mad that didn't use common sense. Other people came after us and they were sat before us, I'm not sure what the protocol was for that. 
Then when we were seated we asked to sit Uber the canopy because there were less people; but she said that this area only had one server and those tables were not opened. Again, I didn't complain. The hostess came to clean a table, next to us a d the pray bottle was on stream and not spray, so she cleaner bounced off the table and she said ""I'm sorry if I sprayed you, but oh well the table is at least cleaned.  While we were eating, the other hostess sat a party of 8, right next to us and not everyone in their party was present.  I truly believe that these hostesses just need to be train to be caring about the guests needs. 
I will come back and eat here again, because Gregg made a difference and so did the manager by getting us our food fast."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Fathers Day Review and first time @ BlueWater 

1. Reserved table for upstairs and outside @1pm. Upon arrival we were told they did not have our table and we would be seated inside. The most frustrating part of this is that they had a walk-in (no reservation) who requested outside and they were placed in front of us if we were willing to wait '2 hours' for the outside seating. 

2 Upon seating we were immediately told many things were no longer available including- ponzu scallops, mahi  mahi, and various small accompaniments like whipped cream. (Keep in mind they had only been open for one hour at this point) 

3. The 'Fishermens Bloody Mary' which was meant to be served with special condiments did not come with condiments as they weren't available. (And we were not made aware prior to it being served to the table)

4. An hour into service and after appetizers, we were told the  king crab legs we ordered were not available. 

5. Surf and Turf Steak was ordered medium rare and was served rare. The thing was still mooing. We returned it and they brought it back (reheated) grey and dry. We opted out of the steak completely. 

6. We ordered the freshly baked chips and were served fries. 



By the end of service and between the 4 of us, we had two successful plates served but still somehow managed to spend $125 on a mediocre meal.  ($155 with tip as it wasn't our waiters fault, and we actually felt bad hearing him, hesitantly, tell every single table they were out of almost half the menu.)

An overall disappointment for what was meant to be a special Fathers Day Lunch"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,First time here - could not have been a nicer Friday night dinner with my BFF! Service was friendly and efficient. Our server was also knowledgeable with the menus items and assisted me with making a decision (I was being very indecisive). Our food cane out in a timely manner and was presented beautifully.  We were both vet impressed with the flavors of our dishes.  The pic is of the sashimi scallops our server recommended and we both thought were super delicious!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Four of us were at the training dinner.  Despite a great wait staff, it could not save the dinner; all four meals were bad.  The steak ordered rare was grey and rubbery with a fake grill mark; the scallops with grits were inedible, grossly over-salted and bitter; the fish and chips was also highly oversalted --not just a little, but like the scallops, as if someone simply poured salt all over the dish.  The salmon had a metallic, weird taste.  Our very good waitress was at a disadvantage because the bar did not have our wine ready in a timely way (both the first and second bottles were very late, by the third it came on time.)  They have a lot of work to do, and first they need new kitchen staff.  I know it was just training for the real opening, but this there is more than one of these places and they should have their menu down by now."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What a beautiful Restaurant! 
The food is good and fairly priced. 
The location is amazing and the staff is friendly, this place is a great addition to our little town.
Welcome to Santa Barbara"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Used to be good when they first opened and now they have become just another tourist trap. Expensive and mediocre food. Dont be fooled by the decor and price thinking this will be some great seafood.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Came here for my birthday dinner as a group of 7 on the Saturday of Fiesta. The restaurant I had originally planned on (which was away from the usual crowds) had to cancel the day before due to an emergency, and I got lucky in that Bluewater Grill was able to take down a reservation for my large group for dinner during Fiesta on such short notice.

I had two vegetarians in my group and only the sides on the menu looked suitable, so one in my group called and the staff member said they could do a vegetable risotto, make the pasta suitable by taking out the seafood, etc., which was promising.

However, we get seated after waiting 20 min for the group using the large table before us (FYI they also only seat you when your entire party is present) and our server informs us that the kitchen is so backed up that the chefs can't modify anything. We were really disappointed but understood since it was busy and short staffed everywhere.

So, one of my veg friends wanted to get the side potatoes, which is listed as ""roasted marble potatoes with mustard butter and garlic."" Thankfully, she asked the server if there was any meat or fish and it turns out they use bacon in the preparation, which isn't listed. Vegetarians and non-pork eaters, beware!

Only giving two stars because the gemelli pesto pasta and swordfish were decent, sea bass was all right, and our server was sweet enough to bring out a birthday dessert of ice cream with a candle.

Side patio wasn't exactly the ""special occasion"" vibe I was going for, but again this was not my first choice. Maybe it would have been better on a non-Fiesta weekend, but you should definitely disclose ingredients on the menu."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Brought a party of ten on a busy Friday evening for a birthday celebration and let me just say everything was perfect. From the moment we walked into the restaurant all of our accommodations were met. Our server Sean did an amazing job he was patient and provided excellent customer service to our group. If you ever visit this place ask for Sean you won't be disappointed.

I personally had the steak USDA Prime Top Sirloin it was cooked to perfection along with the scalloped potatoes and asparagus. We also tried the New York Steak and Lobsters which was delicious and so tasty.

We also ordered both clam chowders the New England and the Manhattan. I liked the New England chowder the best out of the two. The mixed garden salad with chicken was ok probably our least favorite out of our items. The Angus Cheeseburger was another favorite of the night ."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Went here for dinner while on vacation in Santa Barbara, and loved the location but did not love the experience as much. The table we were seated at had crumbs all over each chair. We had to ask our waiter for utensils twice while our appetizers got cold. They no longer serve lobster but it's still on the menu. They were also out of two other types of fish entrees. The peppered red snapper was pretty good, however it came with an overwhelming amount of potatoes. The Gamelli pasta was a simple yet good choice. The octopus was a very good appetizer with great sauce."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great location and ambiance. For this reason recommend making a reservation in advance! The sea bass was our favorite. Solid portion of fish that had a nice crispy sear. Though it was pretty good, it was also a little dry and would probably go well with some kind of sauce so ask for lots of lemon. The snapper was super yummy as well. 

Skip their mixed drinks and try the Topa Topa Spectro Hazy Ipa from Santa Barbara. I'm not a beer person but it was super light and refreshing, went well with our dinner!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Was really looking forward to dinner here but it was a little lack luster. The food was good but not great. Location was very nice service was good
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We stopped here to get some appetizers and cool off with some drinks on a very hot afternoon. We got the calamari and the crab artichoke dip. Both were amazing! The drinks were also super yummy! The wait staff was very helpful with their suggestions and really attentive with making sure our water was refilled on such a hot day. Would definitely love to come back to try some of their entrees next time.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Clam chowder ($8): 9/10 they didn't give me crackers but sooo delicious 

The little gem salad with added shrimp ($21): 8.5/10 kinda pricey for only 5 pieces of shrimp and the lettuce was uncut but really delicious! 

we parallel parked on the other side of the street. We didn't have a reservation and they sat us upstairs in a cute booth with no wait time. Will definitely be back :)

Bonus points because the waiter refilled my water 50 times and service was really good and quick"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"A very nice spot for any outdoor dining, that said on the side patio, you don't get a great view of the ocean. But you do feel the breeze, the nice sun and I'm glad I was able to arrive with my party a bit earlier than when all the seating started to pack up. I do wish we were seated under the shade though because it did get hot. Everything was freshly made though some items I think they could have gotten more creative with the seasoning/butter you can say. Examples like the lobster roll and crab avo toast just needed an extra flair (tasted fresh but boring), but their oysters and raw scallops were excellent, albeit the scallops this time being much much smaller than my last visit a while back. The steak and chicken dishes were also pretty tasty for a seafood place. 

Service was great as they continued to refill 1/2 my party on the bottomless mimosas and still do checkins while the place was busy. 4 stars overall for my recent visit."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Food and service where amazing. I had the clam chowder it was creamy, which I enjoyed. My husband had the grilled swordfish and said it was great. I highly recommend sitting upstairs - the view is awesome! Our drinks were great and the bartender was very educated on the menu"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Could not have been happier to have my holiday party at Bluewater Grill! Collin and Dallas made it effortless and amazing! From moment we entered the restaurant I knew it was going to be great- classy, sophisticated, and welcoming! The waiter was on point and the food was so good! I had originally made the reservation for 20 and unfortunately had a string of last minute cancellations! Dallas didn't miss a beat and quickly rearranged our tables into one so we weren't spread apart! All the time keeping a big smile on his face. I will definitely be back and would highly recommend Bluewater Grill to anyone looking for a place for a large party dinner!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The early evening we stopped by for a bite to eat I was still craving seafood. Always craving a good lobster roll. Lately the ones I have had I actually have had to send back. I know out here in CA. You are much too polite to do that most of the time. I can't help it . Even though I haven't lived in the Big Apple for over 30 years there are certain things that are in my blood and getting what you paid for is part of that. The belief that if you work hard you still have to stand up for yourself because nobody else will if you don't. Is part of what you have to do! This was not the experience we hoped for. The place is lovely the view and setting make it perfect . It is a shame that except for the bread at the beginning of the meal,which was very good, and the a dessert at end which was divine, the food in between was truly terrible. I speculated, half joking, that they lost their chef  and a number of people on staff havE been taking turns preparing meals. 
I made that joke because whoever prepared each dish thought nothing about the person eating it. In the worst Caesar Salad ever made, the croutons were the size of hockey pucks and just as hard . There was no way to actually eat them, but you could probably play hockey with them. The dressing was much too oily with no flavor, and the little fish decorating the salad meant to be anchovies certainly didn't taste the part.  The worst insult of this menu for me was their Lobster Roll . For $29 to serve a customer old dry lobster meat on a nice buttered roll, doesn't hide the terrible sin this restaurant committed. What, did they think their customer didn't have taste buds!   I would have sent it back if it hadn't taken so long to get the food and I wasn't so hungry.  The only saving grace for this  place was their dessert which sent both of us into raptures. Their Mud Pie was to Die For! It was literally the best I ever had! I would suggest until they improve their food service you go just to enjoy the setting and that fabulous Mud Pie!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My husband and I just celebrated our 33rd anniversary here. We had beer/cocktails, appetizer, dinner and a celebratory dessert! ALL DELICIOUS with excellent service. In a huge jaw dropping moment, as it was time to get the check, our waiter said ""somebody paid for your dinner anonymously."" Whoever you are, somehow I hope you see this! We are so grateful for this random act of huge kindness and hope it comes back to you soon. We promise to pay it forward!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I will start off by saying that the service I received here was 5/5 stars! The staff is friendly and accommodating! I appreciated their service and dedication. 
However, the food here is okay. My partner and I went for dinner and I had the Ciopinno and he had the lobster roll. Both were underwhelming and not very well seasoned for our tastes.  
I had high hopes for the food here having read a lot of great reviews but for me it fell flat."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,The only thing we liked about this place was the water. It really did taste good. We had fish and chips platter and the fish had a bad after taste. My husband and I left the whole plate there and just ate the French fries. Unfortunately it was the most expensive water and fries we have ever had.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The location is amazing.   The atmosphere is fantastic and the place is beautiful.  This review was for Mother's Day so this could have been a less an indication of the everyday.    

The service was spotty but again it was Mother's Day.   The need to flag down the server was a bit annoying after a while.   The biggest issue with the service is that brought all the dishes EXCEPT the mom in our group.   Her meal was 5 minutes later and made things a bit awkward.   

The food was above average albeit the starter of calamari was small for the price charged.  I had the pan seared sea scallops which were very well done and enjoyed.  

I would like to visit this place outside of an event day to see if the service is better.   With better service this would be 4 or 5 star location.   Stay tuned for my next visit."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I'm shocked I haven't written a review for Bluewater! It's one of my go to seafood restaurants in town. The location is perfect for anyone who wants to dine in the heart of our beautiful water front. 

There's plenty of seating available but I recommend dining upstairs on their balcony or at the bar, if you are lucky to grab a spot. 

My go to drink is always the Mai Thai. It really packs a punch and always made perfectly. 

I've tried many items on the menu, but my favorites are the ceviche and ponzu sashimi sea scallops to start. Both are excellent choices and light so you won't be stuffed before your main meal. I love how the ponzu sashimi sea scallops are served in a beautiful sea shell. The ceviche is also well presented and served on top of a crunchy tostada, but the tostada shell is small. I recommend asking for some tortilla chips on the side to help scoop up the ceviche. 

It's hard to pick a main meal that stands out to me, but the shrimp tacos are pretty good. I was surprised at how generously filled the tacos were. I was full after eating one taco. I recently tried their Angus cheeseburger, which was delicious! My son had the crab cake benedict from their brunch menu and loved it. His plate was wiped clean, so that says how good it was. 

Overall, a great place to dine at for seafood and drinks along the waterfront."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I have been to the Bluewater Grill many times and each time I've had a great experience! I've come here for lunch, for dinner, for happy hour, and even just for drinks. They have great lunch and dinner menus as well as many delicious things on their happy hour menu too! They have a great cocktail menu and my favorite is their mojitos here!

For lunch I've had the fish tacos, ahi sandwich, pesto chicken sandwich, and the seared scallops! The ahi sandwich has to be my favorite thing on their lunch menu! It was seared perfectly on both sides and came with this incredible wasabi on it which made it even more delicious! I love their New England clam chowder too. It's perfectly creamy but not too rich which made it just right! This clam chowder has won many awards too so I would highly recommend trying it! They also have the Manhattan Clam Chowder if you like that one. :)

For dinner I've had the pasta with shrimp and scallops, mahi mahi, shrimp and scallops skewer, and the roasted veggie chopped salad with chicken! All of their seafood I've had has been very fresh and delicious! Everything has always been cooked perfectly and the chicken was also very tasty too. 

Their happy hour menu is awesome! They have some of my favorite appetizers on here and so I try to come during happy hour to enjoy them! They have $4 oyster shooters and edamame on the happy hour! They even have some $5 beers on there too. Crispy calamari, fish tacos, steamed black mussels, house wine, and some cocktails are only $6 on the happy hour menu. For $7 you can get a bar burger, baked crab and artichoke dip as well as the new england clam chowder fries! This is why their happy hour is so good, because it includes all of this amazing tasty delicious food dishes! They even have some great drink specials on here too. Happy hour is Sunday-Thursday 3-6:30pm! :)

Overall I've had a great experience here everytime I come here! Also they have an amazing patio so try to get a seat up there if you can and they even have an incredible bar on the second floor with great views too! With great service, delicious food, and an amazing happy hour why not come here?! I'll be back soon for a tasty bite! :)"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,I have been dining here for almost two years now with everyone from my friends to my bosses and it has been amazing every time. The food is spectacular - you must try the crab cakes they are perfection. Aside from the culinary skills in the back I think the reason I come here so often is the incredible staff. Just the last time I was there I had the most lively and engaging conversation with one of the buss boys (I believe his name was Josh) which was excellent service no one would ever think would come from a buss boy. Yet again I cannot wait to go back and eat and drink with my friends and be taken care of by the best restaurant staff. Forget just the bartenders and chefs this whole restaurant only provides the best from the top down - highly recommend because I always feel taken care of by everyone I have an interaction with!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came here for our last night of our honeymoon. It was so amazing. Food was on par! Our server, raya, was so sweet and fantastic ! We can't wait to come back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Loved the atmosphere outside.  Food was great and staff was all really nice too.  Perfect location!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Good food creatively prepared, good service, but rather pricey!

My dh and I both had the clam chowder (very good!), a shrimp and crab Louis (which my dh loved as it was chock full of shrimp and crab), an octopus appetizer (perfectly grilled and assembled with spicy red pepper shavings and a spicy sauce, and a glass of wine.

The service was friendly and efficient.

It was an expensive meal: the clam chowder bowl was $10 and the octopus was $18.  The shrimp and crab Louis was over $20.

While the food was very good, this would be a place to go for a rare splurge...."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,We waited for 1 hour still didn't get our food. This place discriminates Asian people. The whole Santa Barbara is not Asian friendly anymore. So trash service
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"One of the worse service I have ever received , staff is distracted with other stuff talking to eachother about personal things cussing    Just an all around waste of time . Food was just ok"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,We love to sit upstairs here! The view is amazing and the atmosphere is bright and inviting. We will not dine downstairs due to the lack above mentioned features. The service is usually descent upstairs as well. We really love the ponzu scallop appetizer-it is not to be missed!  Seating at the bar is first come first serve although the hostesses can be funny about letting people go upstairs to check it out. They are oddly protective about it. ‍
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The food was average... 
The risotto wasn't good 
My son ask for a sundae from the the kids menu and they serve him coffee ice cream,..."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Not sure what is going on with the food scene here in Santa Barbara but I've yet to have one good meal here.
I paid about $50 for crab cakes, a Caesar salad and some pie.
Crab cakes smelled funny and tasted very average. 
Caesar salad was absolutely awful.. 
best thing was the pie.
I must be spoiled at home cause man, this was not it.."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Grab a seat outside to watch the sunset and enjoy some great food.

Food: we took advantage of the happy hour and ordered one of everything. Sliders, Prawns, Oysters, Fries, and beers. Everything was great, except I didn't enjoy the oysters, not sure why but I don't think it takes away from the rest of the food. I did see our neighboring table ordered full dishes of seafood and they looked amazing.

Atmosphere: we asked for a seat out on their patio, which has a great view of the ocean and pier. There are only a few tables so it is probably hit or miss.

Service: was great. One of the dishes took forever to come out so they took it off the bill.

Tip: sit on the patio, enjoy the sunset and eat a great seafood dinner."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Not quite right on the water (there is a big street between you and the water), but it's close enough for you to take a stroll before or after your meal. Obviously, being SB and on the water, things are a bit pricier than a normal place.

We got the seafood platter sample thing which had scallops, oysters, and shrimp. So good. 

The seafood louie salad was a favorite - the crab salad was nice and flavorful, and the veggies made us feel like we were being at least somewhat healthy. We also got a side of asparagus and two glasses of whites (I don't remember what they are...I think a pinot grigio and a chardonnay, but I'm terrible with wines).

Overall, good experience.

There are parking lots in the area (didn't check the prices), we lucked out with some street parking."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We were invited to their original soft opening. Have dined there and visited the bar upstairs many times. 
Our dining experience last week was a absolutely terrible. We were seated downstairs where we were ignored for a long time until I asked for service. The service continued to be bad. Our food was the worse. Neither one of us ate half of it. Was told the chef was training others and that was probably the problem. Were never offered bill reduction or even a desert. We will not
Be returning, and I'm sure they could care less. To many great places in Santa Barbara to dine."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Great ambiance. Nice music. Golf and Tennis on the television. Friendly hostess, waitress and server. A really relaxing atmosphere. 

The brunch menu was small. The brioche French toast, Crab Benedict and 2 seafood soups came recommended. I ordered the Bloody Mary and shrimp & sundried tomato frittata.  

My frittata was crusted but completely runny. I'm not sure if it was the addition of fresh tomatoes or egg or both. I ate the shrimp and ordered the recommended French Toast. So, I didn't refill the Bloody Mary at half off. 

They ran out of plain maple syrup and gave me a habanero maple that was like a sweet & sour sauce. The waitress double-checked on the maple syrup... And there was no stock. She brought me more fruit compote and butter, (I really love butter. I can just eat the butter). 

From what I had to eat this brunch, the food was plentiful but just passable. I recommend others for drinks like at anytime."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Tried to come walk in for dinner. Completely empty restaurant, and they said they were full and couldn't seat us. Will try again next time we're in town and re-review if we decide to come back to try them. 

Seemed like a soft open and I understand if it's invite-only, but maybe the management should train their host staff to be friendly to patrons who inquire - especially if their door is unlocked and they look open. No need to be angry/rude to patrons for asking if you don't have any signage to indicate that it's a soft opening/reservation-only."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,If you want lobster this is the place. Great service and well trained staff! The steak was also really tasty. We will definitely be back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Bluewater grill is always a wonderful experience! I recently went with a large group and our server, Kat, was fantastic! The calamari and new shrimp appetizer were very tasty. Dallas, the manager, was very professional and pleasant. I will definitely be back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,The seafood is fantastic and the view from the second floor is one of the best in town. This may just be one of my new favs in Santa Barbara. High marks.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Was soooo good much better than the earlier place we went to Santa Barbara fish house ... it was perfect and service was amazing !!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Underwhelming food and customer service. We went on what appeared to be a slow day, and still had to wait quite a while for drinks."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"This restaurant had very good reviews, however the food was just so-so. The gem lettuce salad had a delicious flavor profile but the lettuce was completely sandy. I had the whole branzino which  was good, but not great and not at all deboned so I was spitting out mouthfuls of tiny fish bones. My husband had the sea bass and liked it. The wait staff was great but seemed very rushed like they were trying to get us out of there. All in all it fed us and got the job done but I would not go back again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came to Blue Water for a few drinks after work for the first time and had Eddie as my bartender. The bar was seats we're still closed so I sat on the side booth. Eddie made a valiant effort to check in on me and make sure I was tended to, even having to walk around the bar for all my silly requests. I had a raspberry spicy margarita, which eddie whipped up in no time, even with a busy restaurant. He really took care of me. Will definitely come back and hang at the bar again!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Every time I visit Santa Bárbara I come here! It never fails the food is amazing and the staff is even better. I love it. They go above and beyond and are respectful and polite. Can't wait to visit again!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Spot is great but food is not flavorful. Just grilled - that's all. Service was excellent but did not make up for the food
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"A nice spot that's perched along the water in the downtown area. They have a small parking area in the back that gives you 2 hours free as long as you ask the host for the promo code to use. The service was good even though staff had admitted that they were new on the job. No complaints there. The restaurant filled up quickly during peak dinner hour so a reservation is recommended.

Octopus - The potatoes were good but the octopus was okay. I needed more texture and flavor.

Fish and Chips - A large portion on a large plate! The fries were really good and I was surprised that there was both ketchup and marinara on the plate. The fish was crunchy, flakey and was fried well but was really really under seasoned. The slaw was just okay. In all it left more to be desired."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Even though I was super sad they were out of the Lobster Roll the food here is impecable! You can tell each dish is made with quality in mind! Would recommend coming here!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Lovely setting, huge menu and (speaking for our group of four) fresh seafood, for sure.  Rare for this tourist area of Santa Barbara.  Am giving four stars instead of five for two reasons:  The server was overzealous in soliciting our Yelp review, making sure we used his name and suggesting things I should say.  And the birthday 'surprise' I had been promised (a desert for one of our the people in our group) was not delivered.  Not a big deal by itself, but when I quietly mentioned this to the hostess on our way out, she claimed ""Well, you needed to remind your server.""  I said that a mention to the hostess usually suffices since it would hardly be a surprise if I was forced to tell our server at our table.  ""Well,"" the hostess retorted, ""these birthday acknowledgements do not flow automatically from the reservation or even the hostess; the server has to be reminded.""  In a more customer-focused restaurant, this would not be necessary."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Had a great meal at Bluewater! Not long of a wait on a Saturday night. We loved the Pan Seared Salmon and Peppered Snapper. The Santa Barbara Gin & Tonic and Cucumber Mojito were also delicious! Stefany was very welcoming & provided quick and friendly service!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"This is an over-priced tourist trap. I will start at the end--when the bill came, they had added $2 for a ""split plate"" salad. No one asked for the salad to be split, and we purchased it out of guilt when the waitress asked repeatedly if we didn't want to add to our order--'no appetizers? are you sure? really? how about a salad?' The sanddabs I ordered are listed as $18.50 on menu, but we were billed $19.50 for them. That is just a rip off built into the computer system, and it gives you a good sense of the kind of place this is. The sanddabs were greasy and served on scalloped potatoes badly gone wrong. Whatever mistake it is when a chef's attempt at custard turns into scrambled eggs--that is what happened. Maybe it was over-microwaved? Terrible texture, no flavor. My husband ordered the fish and chips--stay away from the ""housemade chips"", which although ""housemade"" and probably decent when fresh, were just a big ole pile of stale something. I would be embarrassed to serve this food to anyone, but shameless is as shameless does, as the rip off on the bill would indicate. I didn't bother quibbling over the $3 in the bill--didn't want to bring my husband down, as this was the first night of a special trip. Just made a note to self to avoid and warn others off."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Great location and vibe! We went for dinner on a Friday night and there was no wait. Would be great to sit outdoors for the view but it was too chilly. The view from indoors is still beautiful.
My boyfriend and I got the Seafood Cioppino and Gemelli Pasta. 
We were disappointed they didn't have more fresh seafood items on the menu. We wanted the King Crab Legs but they were sold out. 
The food was not up to par. The seafood cioppino was too sour from the lemon. The sauce wasn't flavorful and the seafood were very small. 
The pasta was a bit bland. 
Overall nothing stood out for us."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Happened to be in santa Barbara and pass by this place. One of he best sea food places I've ever eaten at.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"So my girlfriend and I decided to try here on our vacation in Santa Barbara. We made an 830 reservation and we were pretty much seated right at 830. If I can suggest ask for the tables upstairs we got one in the corner that was over looking the ocean it was beautiful scenery. We were greeted by Julio and Chris who were the bartenders/servers. Both guys were awesome throughout our visit there. Very attentive and nice. 
   They give you some yummy sourdough bread to start you out and we decided to start with their Fried Calamari. It's a pretty good portion and it arrived it wasn't to hot and seemed like it'd been sitting for a little downstairs but it was still delicious! I really liked the breading on it and it was mostly rings and steaks, no tentacles so that made me really happy ! It comes with a sweet chili sauce and a delicious tartar sauce. 
      For Dinner we decided to split their Surf & Turf and a ceasar salad. Let me just say OMG!!! It was an 8oz sirloin with an 11oz Lobster Tail and scalloped potatoes and grilled asparagus. The portion was huge. The Sirloin was cooked Perfectly Medium. Nice and red in the middle and a delicious crust on top with beautiful Grill marks! It was juicy and delicious!
     The Lobster Tail was cooked so well!! It has this amazing seasoning crusted on top that was almost like a Cajun seasoning and it came with drawn butter. It was seriously the best lobster tail I've ever had !! Nice and juicy and melted in your mouth. The scalloped potatoes were cheesy and flavorful and the asparagus was grill perfectly. It was seriously one of the best meals I've had in a long time ! 
      I strongly recommend trying this place out. You will not be disappointed. We will definitely be returning next time we're out here ."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Extremely nice and accommodating staff. We were late to our reservation for 30 min as we got lost and they were forgiving about it. The restaurant has a parking that's a big plus given it's hard to find parking around it. They took us to the upstairs patio with a wonderful view. The food was great too. It was a cold night so when other guest left, the brought 3 heaters for our party of 4 ( plus 2 kids). 
My toddler ordered a chocolate cake for desert. The servers told us afterwards that they made it themselves as the cooks had left, not to disappoint my little girl. We had a lovely time with our friends that we hadn't seen for ages. All the staff wore masks properly which was another plus for this restaurant."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Excellent service Excellent food really enjoyed the atmosphere and it was poring rain
But the restaurant was cozy and comfortable highly recommended"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"We had a family night at Bluewater Grill because we heard rumors of to-die-for happy hour tacos.  The tacos, unfortunately, weren't to-die-for.  

There were four of us and all of our tacos had one small piece of fish in each with an unrealistically small amount of toppings.  Perhaps it was just an off day, because the waiter took a long time to get to our table, and a longer time to serve our food, with very little people in the restaurant.  We thought it was perhaps a happy hour thing because the plates being brought out to customers not purchasing on the happy hour menu looked delicious and had a good amount more food.  I would go back just because this place is well talked about but our experience with the happy hour menu was sub par."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Had dinner there the other night. I had the salmon with scallop potatoes. It was absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this place.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Fish and chips were awesome.  We sat upstairs and had a great view.  The service buy the bar staff was phenomenal!!!  The food was great and the atmosphere was beautiful.  The fries the sauces and the Cesar salad was tasty.   I would come back again.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Finally! After 2 visits and many mixed reviews from friends, I'm ready to review Bluewater Grill. 

My Verdict:  Great place if you are a TOURIST in Santa Barbara. You won't know what you're missing as far as other locations and it will feel like you've had a cool ""SB experience""...

The Details: Locals will leave having wished they went to one of our many other local fave options in the area instead. To their credit, Bluewater grill has a nice ambiance, cool view, and trendy design. Most importantly - compliments to the chef - the food (when it finally comes) is delicious, even if it's not what you ordered:). 

Locals read on.

So this place is stylish and beautiful, but oh soooo many rules. To start, if you want happy hour you have to sit at the bar and can't order outside the menu, if you don't want dinner you can eat at the bar upstairs but can't do happy hour, but if you want drinks and a view then you can sit on the patio but you have to order full dinner. So its almost impossible to get your buzz on the outdoor patio because the servers are literally hounding you to order more and more food.  BWG is making a big mistake here. They fail to realize that if they let people order what they want, how and when they want it, people will end up happier, feeling more relaxed, and SPENDING MORE MONEY. It's pricey, no doubt-but worth it if you are able to enjoy it. Too many rules does not fit with the SB vibes - locals know better and will opt to go elsewhere where they can relax. Sure, the occasional person might just order a drink or two but the overall flow and feel of the place will be enhanced tenfold if they cut the crap with the ordering police. 

Service: Welp, it's pretty bad. I hope they get better but as of now - it's j obvious most of the servers aren't experienced and the managers are hoping the location would make up for their staff's poor hospitality. This is a generalization based off of my experience. But, both times I was there it seemed that my servers had not worked in a restaurant before and were not trained. Their flow and delivery was so far off the mark we wanted to walk out several times before our drink and food finally arrived. They acted as if they were swamped when the restaurant was just barely busy and slow.  They also had issues with clearing the table - leaving finished plates on your table for long (very long) periods of time without ever stopping by to ask if you would like anything else. Your only opportunity to ask for a refill, or for a fork, or a napkin is when you're being served as they do not check on you in between.  Our server was borderline hostile when we kept ordering more drinks and appetizers instead of a dinner plate. After 3 drinks, 3 appetizers and a main salad she came back saying we needed to order more food. Finally, I gave up thinking ""just bring me whatever will qualify me to be able to sit here in peace!""

*Food:  When your ingredients are fresh the rest is just a matter how you serve them.  Here's where Bluewater Grill made a great decision and also the reason for 1.5 stars: Chanel Ducharme, former chef de cuisine at the Hungry Cat, knows seafood. She whips up complex but balanced plates whos flavors linger in your mouth leaving full of curiosity and delight. Her food is intelligent and packed with umami and style. She is not afraid to surprise you by using spicy or sweet ingredients when you wouldn't normally expect it. The difference between her food here and Hungry Cat is it's all COMFORT food. The dishes are by no means skimping on the butter or carbs.  This food makes you forget you already used your cheat day and have at it! the only issue is the menu. The menu is really confusing and visually hard to digest. Too many words cramped together in black and white and unclear. This is an easy fix, hopefully they do!
Go for the Scallops! Raw in their shells with a tangy, citrusy, light fresh taste, supple and sweet feeling full in your mouth as well as pan-seared scallops which are cooked to perfection, dry outside with a crusty sear and juicy and tender at the center. Also, the roasted veggie salad was delicious. 

Ambiance: .5 star for the location! BWG is stylish and trendy but cramped. The patio has a restrictive feeling with the noise from traffic echoing off the walls during rush hour. The umbrellas look like a safety hazard as they are heavy and sway unpredictably in the wind and heaters are not very practical, bulky, and poorly placed. The tiny patio has about 35 chairs outside and servers can hardly navigate through without bumping into someone or something. Everyone seemed too busy to be attentive or maybe just a bit apprehensive."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Chowder 

Ordered a quart of chowder to go.  She added half a loaf of bread too.  Wish I would have gotten 2 quarts....  We'll be back."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great location in the heart of Santa Barbara, across the street from the wharf. The seafood was fresh and if you are lucky to get a seat on the second level patio on a nice day, the people watching and views are fantastic. Staff is friendly and they have great happy hour drink specials. Make sure to check in via yelp for 1/2 off a drink!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,So glad this is opened during Covid. Seating outside with beautiful views. Amazing food & great service! We have been here a few times. When we are in town we make an effort to stop here.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We went for happy hour/ early dinner. We got garlic fries, shrimp sliders, calamari, crab and artichoke dip and the ceviche. The food was very good.

The garlic fries were hot, crispy and had plenty of garlic. The shrimp sliders were tasty, but could have used a little more sauce. The calamari with crisp, and came with an aioli and sweet/ spicy sauce. Both sauces elevated the calamari. We put some of the aioli on the shrimp sliders, and it was a game changer. The crab/artichoke dip was fantastic. The chips were a little chewy. It was like the chips soaked up the oil so they weren't crispy. I was able to forgive that because the dip was good that the chips were just used as a vehicle to get the dip into my mouth. And the ceviche was light and fresh with a welcome amount of spice. Overall, food was delicious.

Our server was delightful. She was knowledgeable, attentive and courteous. We came by many times to check in on us, and made good recommendations. She was busy, but never seemed like she was rushing or overwhelmed. 

We also got a few drinks. My fiancée got the santa barbara gin and tonic, which she said was refreshing. She also got the dirty pigeon, which is their espresso martini. She said that might have been one of the best drinks she has ever tasted. I got a cucumber mojito and pomegranate margarita. The cucumber slightly overpowered the mint of the mojito. The margarita was a strong, but still very tasty."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Excellent customer service and probably one of the freshest seafood restaurants in town! Came by for dinner one night with some work colleagues. It wasnt busy at all, and were sat quickly. 

If you are as lucky as we were when we visited, they may have some hand harvested local santa barbara sea urchins in stock. IF they have one, get it. It was so tasty. They crack open a fresh sea urchin and serve it fresh, with some lemon and housemade furikake saltines. Ours was so fresh, the urchin's spines were still moving.

For my main dish, I ordered the grilled whole fish over some potatoes and fried broccolini. The fish was perfectly grilled, and seasoned. The vegetable mix complimented the meal. 

Overall I really like this new addition to the SB waterfront and forsee myself coming back very soon, hopefully they'll have some sea urchins then too!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Host very accommodating with seating. Pet friendly outdoor seating. Server super welcoming and friendly. Steak was savory and with enough fatty to make it juicy. Lobster macaroni disappointing because the macaroni elbows were your standard nothing extra and not cheesy. Broccolini was overly charbroiled and tough. Lave cake just the right amount of sweetness. Cesar salad fresh and flavorful. Overall great dinner.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I really had high hopes for this place because of the restaurants rating. My family and I had put this on our must go list but always ended up going with nearby restaurants (mostly because the wait was long and I was already hangry).
Finally, came the other day, wait was not too bad. We chose outdoor seating, weather was great. 
We were seated and shortly after our waiter came to greet and stated they would bring water which they did. It took over 30 min for someone to come back to get an order going. Now, I can understand when they are busy, but when there are tables behind us (some that arrived after) it makes one wonder. Finally, waiter comes and we ordered some apps, we tried getting the QR code but for some reason never worked. Another young lady very friendly brought us menus. 
Fast forward, waiter never came back to ask us if we were ready to order entrées. Over an hour, meanwhile tables behind kept getting asked if they needed anything by same waiter. We ended up getting check and left and went to nearby restaurant where Service is great. Not a return for me. 
 The review unfortunately was based on 2 apps we ordered which were decent."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I ordered on their website and paid but then a few minutes later received a call to say one of the dishes was unavailable. Not a bit deal, I substitute for a different dish. 

 I ordered takeout so I didn't realize it until I got home but 2/2 dishes were incorrect despite having ordered through their website and confirmed the same order over the phone. 

Disappointed at the lack of quality control and half of the order I couldn't eat so it went to waste."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Very disappointed with our dinner tonight. For it being a holiday weekend, the restaurant wasn't prepared with enough food/fish to serve us. At 6:30 in the evening on a Sunday, you shouldn't expect to have 90% of the food items on the menu unavailable. Whatever dishes we were stuck with ordering were also bland and without flavor. Plating was a mess too. Super disappointed with this location. The only good thing was our server."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,I really looked forward to this place. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and added bacon. It was watery amd not good at all. I ordered the March mated tiger prawns. It had to be the worst I've ever had. I was really looking forward fo these. Brought my honey here hoping to wow him. He ordered the fish and chips. The fries were oily and the fish was dry and coating dry. I'm sorry to say beside location this place was awful. I will never be back.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Great view and great service. The food wasn't too spectacular but verygood enough to wanna go back again with family and dog. Good job guys.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My family and I were visiting the area and love visiting Santa Barbara. This is our first time visiting Bluewater and we would totally return.  It is not easy visiting a restaurant with 4 kids but josh our server was very helpful and super patient with us. Plus they have a yelp 50% off your first cocktail which is awesome! I had the fish tacos and we ordered the cheese burger kids meal and the salmon fish sticks kids meal. Let me tell you the food was amazing and the fish was fresh. I also enjoyed a Serano margarita that was good and a little spicy. The interior is a little more upscale so if you just happen to stroll in from the beach you will feel a little under dressed ;)
Out experience was great and I can't want to come back"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"First off I want to say that I did enjoy some of the food that was served to us at Bluewater Grill. The best and one that might bring us back was the scallop sashimi. It was delicious. Our waiter was courteous and she might have been a new server. 

Now for the rest . . . the restaurant was full and outdoor seating only. We made reservations at 5:30pm. I ordered Sandabs with chermoula sauce, scalloped potatoes, and spinach. The rest of us ordered clam chowder, Lobster Mac and cheese, and Salmon. My wife and I ordered simple drinks plus water.

The food and first drink came out timely except for my daughters entree (clam chowder) which came out about 15 min after the rest. All the food was lukewarm. My Sandabs were bland and needed salt. My wife's lobster Mac and cheese was okay. The lobster cooked perfect and the noodles were cooked fine, but the cheese sauce was very thin.

I ordered a second drink which didn't come out at all. The water we ordered at the beginning of the meal was given to us at about the time we got our check. 

I gave this restaurant two stars based on the service, lukewarm, & bland dishes. But I have to say again the scallop sashimi was awesome."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I always have great food and receive great service at this restaurant. Planning a brunch there tomorrow for my birthday because of easy outdoor seating, which is Covid friendly. Looking forward"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We really enjoyed the food, service was great and the food was delicious. Thank you Taylor for the great service!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"This place had a very clean and beautiful atmosphere to eat, social distancing and the wearing of masks though we're not enforced.  
SERVICE: 
There were kids running around our table and it took us 20 minutes to get noticed by someone after we were seated. The male in the blue shirt had checked on the tables next to us but not us and I couldn't fail to notice he had only attended the 'white' tables who already had their food. I couldn't help but feel like if I were white my table would have better service. 
FOOD: 
The food was delicious!! I loved the calamari and the fish and chips were perfected!! Everything had perfect seasoning and I loved everything!! 

The reason behind the two stars was attributable to the service though I will say the food and drinks were delicious! I additionally loved the side conversations with some of the waiters and wish to see them again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What a wonderful place!
We where in town and wanted to get a bite, walked along the pier and made a reservation in a different place, but there was a wait. So while we were waiting we continue walking. We were passing by this spot and slowed down just for a sec do glaze over the menu. The girls in front was so nice that even though we were planning on coming back , the got us in somehow.
Everyone inside were so nice and food was amazing!

Recommend for sure!!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Thank you to Sam and Amber for making my Santa Barbara experience one of a kind. The Bluewater are truly the mossy personable, sweet and make you feel right at home. The food is absolutely delicious and the views are spectacular! Thanks to the managers,  Dallas and Colin for being very attentive and made my experience divine. I will definitely be back 10/10 recommendation! And Aldo was the attentive busser!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great time with friends upstairs on the patio.  Thought it would be cold, later night, but the heater was just fine; and such a pretty view across from the pier.  Having such a variety of delicious seafood apps was fun for our table and soooo good!  Yes, the scallops on the half shell are all that!  Great oysters, crab dip etc. etc.  Excellent service all the way around - our server Catherine, was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food and drink menus.  Dallas (a manager I think), also came by our table to pull empty dishes, check on our experience and basically topped off the  service."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I am going to go with 3 stars in honor of all the good memories but today was not one of them ... we were prepared to wait for a table but seriously management needs to either review the reservation system or train the staff after opening for outdoor dining again.  We were told 1/2hr wait what seemed beyond reasonable .... we got a drink to go and settled in outside to wait, 45 minutes later I went to check on the status to being told sorry but another 30 to 45 minutes!! How in the world do you go from 30 minutes to 1h15 or more ... what irked me the most was being patronized and told to get a drink while waiting!  We had many dinners, take out, our son's wedding (a year ago) here but frankly today we took our business somewhere else and although my husband is still a fan, he is going to have to drag me to go back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,A fantastic place and highly recommended!  My wife and I vacationed in Santa Barbara for our 15th anniversary and had several dinners here.  The food and drinks are amazing!  Even better the staff really can't be beat!  The manager (Colin) really cares about every dinning experience and the staff always was delightful!  Highly recommended!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"What an amazing dinner for my birthday! Everything we tried, from the charred edamame to the seared scallops with risotto were absolutely delicious. My husband called ahead to Chef Chanel with a special request. She prepared a unbelievable dish just for us that included a lobster prepared chilled and broiled assisted by fresh oysters, shrimp, and scallops on the half shell. Thanks to everyone at Bluewater for making this evening unforgettable!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"What an awful experience. Our server was incredibly nice but that's about it. My friend had a dairy allergy and her food came with dairy on it. My salmon arrived slightly undercooked, but the server insisted on bringing it back and when she did (which took forever) it was very over cooked. The sides were cold both times.  I will not go back to any Bluewater location."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Couldn't believe that I had actually found fried oysters!! The were cooked perfectly and I loved them!!! Will definitely go back for some more while in Santa Barbara!!!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Was a great place for a dinner date with my wife.  Food was excellent and the staff was great.  I ordered the san-dabs, my wife the scallop dinner.  Had a great time before the concert at the Labero.  Will go again, and again and again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"DELISH. And that's coming from someone who isn't that into sea food. Drinks are STRONG (it's a yes from me). Review, done. 10/10 would go again."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place was amazing! Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. My crab Louie was the best I've ever had. I appreciated the kids menu and bento box style. It can be so hard to find a good restaurant for adults with an equally good kids menu, and they nailed it. Service was impeccable with our party of 3 adults and 5 kids. Will definitely return and look forward to it!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I've been to Bluewater Grill I think 3 times now, and each time has been a great experience. Their service is phenomenal--one time I came for a Yelp event and the bartender was so friendly and funny to talk to. I remember the first time I came, I was with 3 girlfriends, and we were absolutely blown away with the tablet check at the end where you could split things however you liked! I believe that time I got the Fisherman's Platter, which was a seafood lover's dream. At the Yelp event, we had a few of the appetizers, all of which were pretty tasty, and I even got to try an oyster shot (not my favorite, but at least I got to experience it). Finally the last time I went, I believe was for a work lunch, and I think we ordered a pretty huge variety of dishes, including the edamame, calamari, ahi tuna poke, crabcakes...I can't even remember everything. I would say that for the most part, the food is good, but since it is a chain it's also not always something to write home about. I would say the service is what makes it worth it, and the food is still pretty tasty too."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Bluewater Grill did such an amazing job making our wedding reception happen! Due to changes in the weather forecast, our patio reservation needed to be moved indoors, and the staff was super accommodating. Everyone was very well attended, all orders were taken and delivered on such a timely basis, it was just amazing! Not only that, but all communication with staff was just all-around awesome when we were making the reservation for our wedding reception. Thank you so much, BWG!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I came here yesterday with my family.. 
we come from Ontario to visit the beautiful Santa Barbara & were excited to try out this establishment.
But honestly, the food doesn't meet its upscale standards nor did the service.
We ordered the Baked Crab & Artichoke dip & the chips were stale. So I kindly told the waiter & he offered to bring a new batch.. 
then he does & procedes to tell us ""they aren't stale.. we make them every morning & once in the afternoon "".. 
I am Hispanic.. lol we make our own tortilla chips, we know what's stale & what's fresh. 
The bags at the market tasted fresher than their ""house made"" chips. 

The coleslaw I had with my order didn't have any seasoning or just tasted flavorless.. & I got the fish & chips.. the fries were tasty! The fish was ok.. I just think it needs flavor. 
My Hun didn't enjoy his shrimp tacos either.
We even seen another customer send back his Lobster tail.. 

I suggest the owner of this establishment, have a good sit down with the chefs & employees.. do a taste test.. on all your food .. & see for yourselves!
We honestly wanted to love this place."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My boyfriend and I fell in love with this restaurant so much, that we decided to go two days in a row this Labor Day weekend. We initially only went in for drinks (which were delicious ) and decided to try some of the food afterwards ( so yummy!)  aside from the drinks, and food, the hospitality by both Solie and Eddie is what made us feel welcomed. I truly wish them both the best, by far the best service we've had in our years coming to Santa Barbara. We'll definitely be there next time we visit SB.Caesar SaladCaesar Salad"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"During these COVID times we are eating on sidewalks of busy street and patios being set up on side streets. This should be a red flag during normal times but right now, somehow this place pulls it off and makes it still seem warm and inviting. We had a reservation for 8. Arrived a few minutes early and checked in. This place was busy, 90 minute wait if you didn't have a reservation. We were seated within 10 minutes. We were seated on the side of the building, on a side street, that was roped off. The makeshift patio had large flower pots and patio heaters.  The lighting was perfect. 
We stated with oyster on a half shell and calamari fritti 6 oysters 2 types of oysters. The oysters were really good. The calamari was good, it probably could have used 30 seconds more in the fryer. I like mine with more crunch, but the calamari was seasoned perfectly and the aioli was really good. 
My daughter had the fisherman's platter. Whitefish, shrimp and scallops served with fries and coleslaw. She loved it. Her friend had the lobster Mac and Cheese. It was the bomb. The top had a toasty panko crust, the Mac and Cheese remained creamy underneath. A really solid dish. I had the lobster roll with chips. The roll was amazing. Nice big chunks of lobster and bread. It was really good, the bread was soft but held up to the lobster. The sandwich had a ton of lobster. 
Overall a great experience. Would definitely recommend to everyone. They have a burger, steaks and chicken on the menu for the non fish eaters."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The Bluewater Grill in Santa Barbara is located across the street from the pier and has a great view when seated indoors by a window, or, outdoors on the patio. We recently visited during a stay in Santa Barbara and were seated indoors by a window. 
Service:
We arrived and were immediately greeted and seating by the hostess at our exact reservation time. Our table was in a nice location; however, the floor under our table had food scraps from the previous patrons. We brought this to the attention of our server, Shaun, who had it taken care of immediately. Beside that faux pas the service was great. Our server was very attentive and the manager spent a fair amount of time walking us through the Santa Barbara city parking app to make sure we did not overpay for parking. Nice touch which was greatly appreciated. 
Food:
For appetizers we had the Caeser salad and Ceviche. They both were tasty. The Caeser was light and had a lemon based dressing, and, the Ceviche was fresh and tasty. 
For entrées we ordered the Gemelli Pasta with Shrimp & Scallops which featured...
Sautéed shrimp, scallops, oyster mushrooms, asparagus, white wine and garlic served in a basil pesto cream sauce, and,
USDA Prime Top Sirloin which featured...
Grilled and served with scalloped potatoes, asparagus, charred grape tomato and garlic herb butter
I substituted the asparagus with their seasonal squash and zucchini mix which was very good. 
The pasta was perfect. No complaints. The steak was slightly underseasoned and slightly overcooked (wanted med, got med well). Still very good - no reason to send it back. 
For desert we had a Lava cake that did not have much Lava, and a Salted Carmel Ice Cream sundae that featured three generous scoops. 
All things considered we had an enjoyable dinner experience. The staff went out of their way to demonstrate great customer service. That is greatly appreciated and we will definitely return next time we are in Santa Barbara. I recommend you give them a try too."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My family had a very disappointing dinner at Blue Water Grill last night and I feel compelled to give you this feedback list:
· When I made the reservation I asked to be seated in your upstairs balcony but was told this could not be reserved and was on a first come first serve basis. When we arrived at the restaurant and asked about the availability of the balcony, the hostess told us it had already been reserved.  Interesting.
· Our party of 3 was then seated at a large round table for 6.  We sat at one half of the table and felt all night like we were waiting for the rest of our party to join us.  There were several other open tables around us.
· We ordered your hot crab artichoke dip to share.  Someone placed it on our table without any small plates or a spoon to scoop it up with.  We flagged down a bus boy to ask for small plates which he quickly brought over but without a spoon to scoop the dip out with.  We ended up using our dinner forks to scoop the dip on to our plates.
· Then came dinner.  All 3 dishes (sea scallops, pasta seafood and sand dabs) were so bland and flavorless we couldn't eat them as is.  We asked our waiter to bring parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper.  He told us you were out of crushed red but he brought us a bowl of parmesan cheese but no spoon.  We ended up using our fingers to sprinkle the cheese on to our plates (thankfully we are family).  The dishes were not able to be fixed so we asked for to-go boxes and packed them up.  I'm going to see if I can bring them back to life at home.  For $30 an entrée, I did not want to waste them!
I have eaten at Blue Water Grill several times (pre pandemic) and had always had a positive experience.  This was nothing like what I remember.  I am a local and have lots of out of town guests who visit but I will be crossing this restaurant off my list going forward.
I hope you take this feedback seriously and make some changes.  This is far too great a beachfront location to be wasted."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"First time here. Sat upstairs at the bar. Great service from Chris and Eddie!! The cocktails were fantastic, the ponzu scallop starter was fantastic, swordfish dish was perfectly presented and delicious.  I had the drunken pigeon cocktail for dessert... awesome!  All around, this place has great views, great atmosphere, awesome and friendly service, great food and cocktails... definitely a great spot!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Going to round up to to corona...there was also a very difficult customer at the next table which affected our service. The seating area was the best outdoor space we experienced in Santa Barbara since it was not on a busy street or pedestrian corridor.

Service was good and so was the food...however sides were very underseasoned. We noticed other tables requesting salt too."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I never try to leave bad reviews, especially during the time of Covid where everyone is trying their best. My wife made a reservation for 7:45pm tonight. We showed up at 7:33pm hoping to get seated early. The hostess told us that they're last seating is 7:30pm and that all reservations made after that should have been cancelled.

We were never notified, and they couldn't even make an exception to seat us despite the fact there were plenty of open tables.

The hostess was very nice, but it's clear this restaurant is not very accommodating. With so many other restaurants nearby, we were able to find a table elsewhere. It just would have been nice if there was a manager on duty to apologize.

Blue water Grill- do better."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"It's the Keystone Cops running this place!  First, they couldn't process our GrubHub order because ""the server was down"". Ok, it happens. Cancelled it, then called & placed our order directly. It was simple, two entrees, two beverages. That's it. When we picked it up & got back to eat, no beverages. Honestly, How hard could it be?  
Would not recommend using takeout or a delivery service with them. The food was good though...the only reason they aren't getting 1 star."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The service here alone is worth the 5 stars, not to mention the quality of the food. Came here to celebrate with the family and couldn't have been treated more politely by Colin the manager. Sad to hear he's leaving this place for Finney's as bluewater grill has lost a great manager! He went out of his way to make my group feel taken care of and even took us to the library room himself - see photos! Colin if you're reading this please know you created some wonderful memories for a very grateful family and we'll never forget you!

There was actually a wedding reception happening the same day so for the staff at bluewater grill to give us any attention was impressive given how busy they must have been downstairs!

There's also a beautiful bar we wish we had time to check out on the second floor with a stunning view from the balcony. The seating looked very comfortable there as well, and I was glad to notice the guests were seated with COVID precautions. The interior design was also noteworthy with various quirky and historical photos and sculptures around the walls. Very interesting things to look at anywhere your eyes roam!

Regarding dishes, highly recommend those pictured here especially the pasta (creamy with delicious scallops) and fish (the accompanying sauce with potatoes was perfect). Our waiter gave us excellent recommendations- I just wish we'd taken down his name!

Will definitely be coming back here for the food (and to Finney's to support Colin!) 

Pro-tip- come in the evening for dinner for the unbelievably pink sunset sky!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Review for the food; great food and an amazing side walk adventure settings. I ordered a top sirloin and it was cooked to perfection, my wife made something from scratch and the team obliged with pesto pasta, grill chicken and Serrano peppers. It was better then what we anticipated. We had 4 kids (9 and younger) with is and they had fun talking to our server who was amazing. I think this place is definitely a second visit eligible."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,We went here in the evening and when it started to get colder we asked the manager to have a heater to be put near us because we saw some were not in use and he dismissively told us that they had none left. As we were finishing our meal a table farther away asked for a heater and the manager turned one on for them. The only reason I would come back to this restaurant is for the great service we received from our waiter Seth
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We went here for my sister and brother-in-law's rehearsal dinner. The service was great, but we felt the dishes were unfortunately lacking. We had a set menu and I ordered the scallops with asparagus risotto. I didn't feel the meal had much taste. My mom said her chicken was chewy and one of my sisters and dad didn't finish their salmon as they weren't thrilled with it. I was really looking forward to coming here for the first time. However, the appetizers were great. I ordered the Caesar salad and the other option was clam chowder, which I heard was served hot. The dessert options were a mini McConnell's ice cream sundae or slice of key lime pie, I ordered the sundae, which was yummy and I heard the pie was as well."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Worst local dining experience I've had in a long time.  The location will draw tourists to their dismay, but I doubt locals will frequent often.  How about sourcing some local seafood?  Avoid this place.  

Tried it again, because we had a gift card.  Still unbelievably disappointing.  Try Oku, next door, way better!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"This place has a lot of high ratings but I don't really know why. It's not bad... It's just not that good. Food was average and drinks were good. Not great, not excellent, just good. I ordered the seafood Louie and the seafood had no taste at all. As if it was previously frozen and rinsed in fresh water. I think they rinsed all the flavor out of it. Location is nice if you plan on going for a walk around the area and want to be right across from the ocean."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Service and food was wonderful! We sat out on the balcony which is pet friendly which made our experience even better.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Poor service. We sat for almost 30 minutes without being served water. Food was average quality and overpriced. Will not be coming back.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,My colleagues and I took chance on this place since we each wanted something particular to eat. I craved salmon and it was spot on. One friend ordered fish and chips and the my other friend ordered chicken. Each meal was tasty and filling. The only downfall is our waiter was a bit preoccupied with other tables and had to be reminded to bring the beverages we order with out meal. Other than that it was a nice place to dine.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"This my second experience here and it's quite like the first- bland food. I definitely would hit up Brophy's and the Santa Barbara Shellfish Company before here. 

While the atmosphere is second to none- the food needs some uplifting. 

The crab and artichoke dip had cream cheese filling with very few artichoke hearts. I give that a 5/10.

The fish of the fish and chips was dry. So dry that I had to use all of the tartar sauce. This is where the shellfish company and Brophy's reign. 

They are definitely feeling the Covid blues with lack of staff and supplies. 

We will try something new next time. I do recommend happy hour here during sunset. Can't beat the few at the upstairs bar. No where else on Cabrillo has their view."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The manager was an complete ass. Came here with 10-12 great friends for a birthday with wife, friends and 2 month old. It was like pulling teeth to get a table, drinks and all they could do was complain we were in the ""walk way"" ended up spending $600+... will never come back again because of the service and attitudes from the staff."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I really loved the atmosphere of this place! The service was very fast and efficient and we got our food really early. 

For the appetizers, we got the ponzu sashimi scallops and they tasted so fresh and flavorful. My favorite appetizer is definitely the mussels and pork belly. The sauce in the dish was extremely creamy and tasty. The pork belly was cooked really well and cut into easy to eat pieces. Also, the mussels were fresh and were a good size as well. They even added small cherry tomatoes that fit into the dish so well. I would definitely recommend both of these appetizers. 

I got the sea bass entree which was very delicious. I loved how perfectly cooked the sea bass was and the skin had a crispy texture that paired so well with the sauce they marinated it in. The carrots were also super yummy when I ate it with the wild rice. Normally rice is super heavy but the wild rice was super light and easy to eat. Together, this entire plate had amazing flavors and made me satiated, but not overly full."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Our takeout order came out super fast even though they were very busy. Also ladies at the front were incredibly nice and attentive, again even with the business! Not sure of their names but they were working 6/20 at 7:30pm - kudos to them! The seafood pasta was to die for, and the burger was delicious as well. Will go again next time I'm in SB. :)"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I have a theory--the better the location, the worse the food. I don't know why this seems to reign true so often for me, but it does! This location is awesome--right across the street from the Pacific Ocean. Our drinks were ok (Bloody Mary and Mojito). Bloody Mary was kinda garbage, and the Mojito was slightly better. The lobster roll was ok, clam chowder was ok, my daughter's steak (kid menu) sucked, son had plain pasta--lucky for him they didn't mess it up by adding their own sauce which they brought on the side (what's a better word for disgusting?), and finally-the old lady's salad (she said it sucked). If this location was trash--I'd give it 1 star simply because the value to food ratio is so off (food sucked, price was absolutely not cheap). Verdict--if you don't really care about the food quality...this is the spot! Just hit up Jack In The Box after, when you inevitability don't finish your food...just ask for to-go boxes to give to one of the many homeless people across the street...just be sure to apologize to them before hand! 

Part of my code--pay for the food, never ask for a discount, and if the server offers to take something off the bill...refuse it. I'll just never have to come back. Simple. 

I welcome a response from the owner!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I hate to write this but the last time I went to Bluewater Grill it was pretty disappointing. I will say first though that the location is prime (right across from the pier and water), the space is so cute, the outdoor seating is comfy and very nice at night, and the service is great! 

We went on a particularly busy weekend and the wait time was almost an hour. We were seated under warm lamps so it wasn't too cold. After waiting for so long we were really excited for an amazing meal.

Unfortunately every plate we ordered was not great. The halibut with spinach and scalloped potatoes was not seasoned at all, cold, and needed so much extra salt and even hot sauce to be able to eat. The lobster mac n cheese was watery, not cheesy, and there was not much lobster in there. We also got the mussels appetizers which was alright but the broth was not too hot, and pretty lukewarm. 

For the price point ($15+ per plate), I was hoping for a better experihope to come back to try again next year when they reopen and perhaps other dishes will change my mind!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I've been here a few times. Great spot with good service and good food. 

This restaurant is in the heart of the new Entrada district of downtown and is just gorgeous. It's decorated beautifully and has two levels of seating including a wonderful rooftop deck to enjoy food with an ocean view. 

The waitstaff are mainly college-aged guys, and I've found them to be pretty attentive. On my initial visit, we had Jordan as our server, and he was both charismatic and knowledgeable of the menu. He did a good job despite the restaurant appearing to be short-staffed that evening. 

I ordered the michelada oyster shooter and the fish n' chips. Both were very good. I also had a few cocktails (because why not?!) and they were prepared well. It was a good overall experience.

Seeing as how the weather is beautiful again, I will certainly be back soon!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Friendly staff, great atmosphere, risotto mushy and seafood salad too small of a seafood portion. Overpriced."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Started our Santa Barbara stay here and it was disappointing. Note to self: Do not go to chain restaurants and do not take bf's friend's recommendation.  

Covid precautions: Staff wear masks, outdoor seating with social distancing, chairs and tables are wiped between customers. 

Food: Oysters were not fresh and tiny, we now are worried about having stomachache later, clam chowder very mediocre, lobster roll dry. Not good and overpriced! Yuck. 

Service: Super super slow. We came at 330pm and it was busy (tons of tourists here now). Understaffed. Probably trying to cut down the cost due to this pandemic. 

Overall: DONT COME"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I came here for my birthday and had a great experience! Chris was our server and he was very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. While I debated between multiple things, I was more than satisfied with his recommendations. I got the ciopinno over linguini and it was delicious. I tried the mai tai and the margarita (with mango, per Chris's suggestion) and it was perfect. Chris brought out dessert (lava cake, very yummy) with a candle in it and we ended our lunch on a great note. I appreciate the amazing service and the phenomenal food and atmosphere here. I will definitely be back :)"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"The bacon jam scallops were my favorite! The corn puree sounded a little weird but tastes amazing. We had gotten the fresh oysters, they were good but had lots of little pieces of shells in them. Clam chowder had good flavor, the clams were over cooked, it was pretty chewy. Overall, great service, food was okay.. maybe I'll have to give it another try."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great location, great outdoor space, great service and most importantly great food. Highly recommend the margaritas, scallops sashimi, clam chowder and fish and chips."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"A little disappointed.  Our first meal while on vacation in SB.  
Calamari was caked with batter and was
Chewy with visible freezer burn. 
Chips that came with the crab and artichoke dip were stale and bending. 

Got sick at 2 am after we got back to the room."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Ask to sit on the outdoor patio just off the bar on the second floor -- or at the bar for that matter. The views are the best! We arrived at that odd time after lunch and before happy hour, but we enjoyed the experience so much, we stayed for happy hour. The service was great (across 2 shifts), and we enjoyed everything we ordered, although I will say that the lettuce in the Caesar salad was a bit brown around the edges -- my only complaint."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Excellent Service! 
As well as Professional and Accommodating Manager!
Collin was very prompt on the patio Seating.
 And Chris had excellent service taking our order.
Thank you!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I had high hopes for this place - it was busy on a Friday night but we were able to get seated right away. The seared scallops appetizer was good (although a bit tepid) but that, unfortunately, was the best part of the meal.  Our server took a while to first visit our table and we had to ask twice for water.  Both of our entrees came out with one of the two sides incorrect (mixed vegetables instead of spaghetti squash and scalloped instead of roasted potatoes).  We were able to get the spaghetti squash brought out, but it was so drenched in butter it was inedible.  The guy who brought our food out went to check on the roasted potatoes and never came back.  I tasted the scalloped potatoes thinking they might be good, but they weren't.  Not quite sure how they took something so simple and made it so bad.  After we finished, our waitress stopped by and apologized, but we still got stuck with a full bill.  We assumed that since the manager was called to close out her previous two tables near us, she didn't want to get him involved with us a third time.  

In hindsight, we probably should have waited 30 minutes for a table at Enterprise Fish Co. up the street...next time!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Was excited to try this as our seafood dining experience while visiting SB but left totally disappointed. We got seated at the bar and got set with dirty silverware then when we asked if there were any specials or things we should know about the guy seemed baffled and said he thought they had a halibut special then followed up but saying ""but Sunday is our restock day so we're out of a lot of things."" Ummm ok. So we asked which items they were out of to try to make a decision and he printed out a list of about 17 things and rattled it off. No halibut, no crab, no king crab, no clams and on and on. I literally don't know what they actually didn't have to offer. We got an appetizer dip which was basically a tub of cream cheese and super greasy pieces of tortilla chips. The couple next to us got the saddest looking plates we ever saw and they just rolled it around looking beyond disappointed and that's when we tapped out and left deciding to save our time and disappointment. I think this place must get a crowd because of the beautiful spot on the water which we did enjoy the view but the food-ugh, big no."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Perfect dinner for our first night in Santa Barbara. Not knowing we walked in with 10 minutes left of Happy Hour. 
We ordered fish tacos, oysters, chowder, fried calamari and garlic fries. The delivery of the food and quality met our expectations.
Our drinks on the HH menu weren't up to par. Between the 4 of us we ordered wine, a mule and whiskey. 
Customer service was great by our waiter, buzzer and manager!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Restaurant provides the wonderful service and food. Highly recommend it. It's in the center of Santa Barbara.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The maitre d' Colin is fabulous as is the food, the waiters, the menu EVERYTHING!!!! We loved it and we're going back soon! And they even have their own parking lot with a nice valet!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,My girlfriend and I were in town and we didn't really know about any of the local restaurants so we stopped by here and we were delighted. The food was good I had a burger she had salmon. The service was a bit too slow but I also think that might've been from how busy they were but overall nice scenery overlooking the beach across the street
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,So so so happy with our entire experience here. We had a very sweet blonde girl (she was new/training) who was so great and friendly. My wife and I had fish and chips and shrimp tacos. Both were fantastic. Plenty of food. We also had to try their clam chowder - wonderful. The mule I had was made with the perfect amount of ginger beer. Couldn't have been happier. Will absolutely be back!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Where else can you wait for your table and have the cool Pacific Ocean breezes dancing through your hair? Right here on the edge of the SB Funk Zone at Bluewater Grill. 

Special thanks to Colin and his staff for creating this wonderful outdoor space for all of us. Whether it's down on the Helena Street level, or up on their beautiful Waterfront patio, it's always a memorable dining experience.

We were fortunate to get a table upstairs and were greeted by Annia, who took very good care of us, and was very helpful with all our food and wine questions.

We were in the mood for seafood and she recommended the Oysters on the Half Shell, Ponzu Sashimi Sea Scallops, and Calamari Fritti. Delicious choices, and paired well with the SB Winery Riesling. 

We've always enjoyed their upstairs bar area where the wine, cocktails, and beautiful view of the beach and Stearns Wharf are stellar. It has a fun-vibe, and the bartenders and servers are always spot-on with drink recommendations.

And so much more on their menu, it looks like we'll definitely be back soon."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"SB has a special place in my heart because I love the different vibe it gives off  vs. being in the city of LA. Whenever I need a breather from the LA hustle and bustle; it is my go-to for a break and breather. I am such a lover of seafood and you KNOW SB has some good eats and fresh seafood to offer.
Bluewater Grill has a really nice upstairs outdoor patio area which is perfect for brunch, lunch, or dinnertime. The view is really nice and everything we ordered was delicious (see pictures). The sashimi scallops were very unique from other places I have tried and I definitely recommend it. The staff are super friendly and personable - I will be back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Love that Bluewater has been open through all that has been going on. That being said, they have plenty of seating available both outside the restaurant and up on the balcony. I have been coming here since the restaurant first opened and have been a big fan ever since. Some dishes/ drinks I always come back for would be their ponzu sea scallops, the steamed clams, and their absolutely amazing new addition to the menu: lobster Mac and cheese. I also always order the Bloody Mary they have which is garnished quite well and even includes a piece of pork belly. Overall this last experience was amazing start to finish with excellent service- especially from the kind bus boy named Kai. Love it here!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Came here for lunch with my friend. We sat upstairs on the patio, it was absolutely perfect. The outdoor seating with the umbrellas was nice blocked the sun but also provided some sun protection too. My friend really enjoyed her clam chowder and the service was on point. Christian oue server was very attentive, friendly and overall a pleasure to deal with.

The indoor seating and ambience was also really beautiful too. Loved that it's right across from the beach and you have a nice view of the ocean. Would definitely come back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Great customer service and delicious food. Every time we come over go to  this place. 
Love it."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Way better options here in SB. This joint is for tourists only. Food is not good and overpriced! I had a chicken salad  ick!!! The patio is an afterthought and you have to get on a wait list. Will not go back.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,The food was excellent. Our party of 5 was served on the second floor which a neat little private corner. The view was excellent and the service was really good at first. Then it did slow down a little bit. I did notice our waitress was engaged in a conversation with a patron at the bar when I went to the restroom so that may have been why but all in all the food was excellent. Definitely recommend.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"A friend told me they had really good drinks here so I thought I'd try it. I went on a Friday night with a friend and we got a table upstairs pretty quick. Our server was also our bartender and he was really good! 

We only got appetizers and everything we got was amazing! We got the ponzu scallops, oysters, crab artichoke and clam chowder. Let's just say I was very impressed! The drinks were pretty good as well. 

This is definitely a splurge dinner place or take your date here place. For 2 people our bill came out to about $120. I'd recommend it if it's within your budget!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"the food was fantastic. really a great restaurant. however, the bill was $88.xx and i gave $110 in cash. the server asked if i wanted change. i said yes. she brought me back the same twenty i had given her and a dollar and some change. i clearly wanted change for the twenty as that was almost a twenty five percent tip. i was going to tip $18 regardless. so her greed over a couple dollars cost the restaurant a below average review. otherwise the place is five stars. anyway, i'm sure she knew i wouldn't ask for change again in front of my girlfriend on valentine's day. so i let her keep the entire twenty. despite the good food, a dishonest wait staff is enough to keep me away.

EDIT: 

changed my review from a 2 to a 3 based on owners response. the experience was five stars actually. it still does make me a little mad that i asked for change and for the twenty back. i had actually considered not tipping. it does really bother me that they have a dishonest waitress. she was short, petit, cute, with red hair. so as long as you avoid her i'm sure it is a five star establishment. honestly her service wasn't very good throughout the night. unfortunate such a great restaurant has this issue. 

i appreciate the owners offer. i live in venice so likely won't be back for the drink any time soon. this is fine. i wasn't trying to squeeze them for something free. just think people should be warned."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,Mediocre service and cuisine with tourist prices. We got the swordfish and sole almandine. Portions of the dish were cold or lacked flavor. Great location though and might be a better option for HH rather than a meal.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"This place is not kid friendly. Do not bring baby's or young kids here. They do not have changing stations in the bathrooms, they are not stroller friendly, and high chairs are limited.

Additionally, the food is an absolute disappointment. After unsuccessfully trying to order multiple items that were ""out of stock"" we ordered fish and chips and ahi poke.
There are an abundant amount of places that have much better food in downtown or state street. The fish was small and oily, with zero seasoning. The ahi poke was cut so big it was awkward to fork and the accompanying avocado, chives, and tomatoes were so miserable it was obviously an after thought.

All around a terrible experience for my family and I. On a place that is focused on seafood it doesn't live up to the yelp reviews nor the neighborhood."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Wouldn't recommend this place for a nice dinner. Average food, staff, and ambiance. We had a party of 10 and 1 out of 10 in our party was satisfied with our meal. (some of the best clams they had ever tasted) drinks were good though!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Went here for the second time (first time was pretty good).  Food just ok, service fair.  Busboy pretty much tossed out bread on the table and the bread was hard as a rock.  Waiter ok, but not too engaging.  Consistency is the name of the game.  To survive in an expensive place like Santa Barbara, a restaurant must be consistent.  We live in SB and to survive this place needs the locals.  Somewhat disappointed this time around."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Awesome experience here! We sat at the upstairs bar and we were greeted by the manager Ricardo who recommended great drinks and foods. The bartender Chris treated us so good, he was super friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Carlos also helped us and he was great too. We'll be back!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,This is a wonderful place to eat.  I had the Under Brick Chicken and my husband had the Blackened Sword fish.  Both dishes were amazing.  So delicious.  And the service was top notch.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,A great experience.  Sat at the bar upstairs.  Service was perfect and food was great.  Tried several dishes and all were unique and different.  Give it a try.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"The ambiance here is great, the upstairs deck is the best seating for sunset and people watching...their bar downstairs is nice to enjoy also, the staff are so nice and inviting. Although, every other time I have been here has been wonderful ....Food and service. But some mornings for brunch I've been seated downstairs and if they are full upstairs you get forgotten about, last time I had to walk out because no one came over to serve us after we were just given bread. Another time for dinner  the steak wasn't cooked the way asked, so had to wait for another one while everyone finished their meals at the table, which was a bummer of an experience. Also you can't do happy hour upstairs ...womp womp :("
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Katherine and the entire staff are completely outstanding!! Service, is so friendly (that includes everyone!!) and exceptional! Sooo happy we chose this place!!

Food: most of us got the Fish and Chips and they were by far some of the best I've had anywhere! Generous portion of fat white fish in a crispy flavorful batter. The Cole slaw is fresh with a slight sweet tang. So simple yet satisfying!! Sorry, I didn't get a pic of that. 

Oysters on the half shell - two kinds to sample that night and both were very good. 

Clam chowder - Creamy and perfect in every way. 

We will be back to try other things on the menu. Lots to choose from. Great place, lovely ambiance, great staff, must have an amazing manager to run such a well oiled operation!!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Very good food and service. Very friendly environment i will definitely be coming back when I'm in the area
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"My mom and I came here for dinner about a month ago and ordered a bunch of appetizers to share as our meal. We had the calamari, crab cakes, seared scallops, and rare ahi tuna. It was all sooo good. Maybe the best scallops I've ever had."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Hubby and I took the train to Santa Barbara for a little get away and found those place close to the train station. It was within heels walking distance, which was nice. 

With the atmosphere being so elegant and fancy I thought the food would be as well.  

I always have to try the crab cakes wherever I go and this place was no exception. I ordered and they arrived and I was pleased. 

I ordered the scallops and my husband ordered the blackened salmon. They both needed seasoning. The food was bland but not bad. I was so hungry I forgot to snap a picture but I did get my appetizer. 

Oh I'm also a money saver and asked to use the yelp discount on a drink when you check in and they didn't know what it was but now they do. So go and use your 40% off a drink."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place does social distancing right! All of the tables appear to be more than 6 feet apart, plus this place is right by the water, making it extra breezy. In other words, I felt almost completely safe with the combination of 1) distance between tables and 2) wind to disperse any potential viral particles. The Gemelli was just...*chef's kiss* and the drinks were reasonably strong and tasted good. Shout out to our server Ana who was clearly such a hard worker, super intelligent, and an amazing/attentive server! She made my birthday dinner last night an extremely pleasant one. Ana is the best!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Visiting Santa Barbara was just about the best thing we needed after being cooped up, quarantine style, for months. 

Santa Barbara was quite busy on a Saturday in August. Apparently other people had the same idea about getting out. The weather was warm, but the cool beach breeze made up for it. We opted for Bluewater Grill due to the reviews and the amount of outdoor seating available. 

We were lucky enough to get the second story terrace spot which gave us beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean and beach. The sun was hot, but the multiple umbrellas provided a nice respite. 

I opted the for Lobster Roll. They asked if I wanted it chilled or warmed, being that it was a hot day a chilled lobster roll hit the spot. It came brimming with succulent lobster on a toasted roll. Paired with a spicy bloody mary it hit the spot!"
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Located right across from Stearn Wharf, predictably this place was a bit of a tourist trap, the food was adequate but can be better. 

The 1/2 dozen oysters tasted fresh, Caesar salad was ok but the quality of the lettuce was meh, there were several pieces of brown lettuce stems.  The SF cioppiano was ok, the mussels, clams & tiny scallops were good, the small shrimps were crunchy, the fish did not taste as fresh, it was supposed to have crab meat but we didn't see any.  Broth was adequate, the concoction came with 1 piece of credible garlic bread.  Upon request they also bring you soudough bread that came out piping hot.  

Overall it a very convenient place to stop by for a bite, just be prepared to cough up a few denarius for average food."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Can the hostess Elena be any less personable?  She is abrasive and runs her station as if the customer is an underling that needs to be reprimanded for your mere presence.  She needs to be trained or fired.  

Wait staff is efficient and friendly."
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Everything was so good. Service was excellent. Food was fantastic. Location and atmosphere was superb.
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,positive,Front desk lady was really nice and sweet. Service was excellent. I ordered mahi mahi sandwich with jalapeño aioli on the side ( it was veeeerryyy spicy!) and sandwich was delicious! My mom ordered lobster roll and enjoyed it as well! We will come back here again!
zbrIMldF_O1ZQ0vpUaaa8A,Bluewater Grill - Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Was there 10/30/21, got food poisoning and was wiped out for 5 days. Had wine, clams and raw oysters. Should have know better - oysters tasted odd. Won't be going back."

fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I love Natural Cafe! Delicious and fresh food and you can get anything from salads to pasta to salmon, rice, and veggies. I also love the environment and the little flowers they have on every table. I've had a few subpar interactions with the employees there but nothing to stop me from coming back."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Natural Cafe is one of the best restaurants for vegetarians.  Their Buddha burritos and Falafel pitas are among my favorites. Their new location at Camino Real marketplace is great too,  although the older one at Old Town was more classic.  

The reason I gave 3 stars instead of a 4.5 or 5 was because of a few ridiculous rules they have.  First,  they regularly email discount coupons but want them to be printed in order to avail the discounts.  I find this very silly.  The name of the restaurant is Natural Cafe and they have messages all over the place to protect the environment.  But it's strange that they need a paper printout and don't allow if we show them the email in the phone. 

Second,  they are also very strict with timings.  If you come around the closing time (9 PM), they just keep showing at the table to get you out.  The older place at Old Town was more relaxed with the timings. 

I would have given a higher rating of not for these absurd rules.  The food here is still one of the best."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Celiacs in the area def need to check out this place!
They have a number of gluten free options and accommodate to preventing cross contamination to the best of their abilities if you mention your dietary needs.
My fav thing from there is their chicken quesadillas."

fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"I think I'm over Natural Cafe. The other day I ordered my usual SB Veggie Grill, and realized it no longer comes with the tahini sauce. It's just grilled veggies on brown rice. When I asked what happened to the sauce the employee said it now costs $2 extra.  It's already $11.50 for the plate (grilled veggies and tofu on a bed of brown rice). Unless there's something about tahini being super expensive that I don't know about, I don't get why you would take away a sauce from a menu item and then charge for it. I think that's bad business."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Every chance I get, my partner and I share the dinner special when it's the pasta. I add an order of grilled chicken which is always delectably wonderful and quite a bargain at less than $3. They split it for us, give us a dinner salad on a separate plate and it's the most wonderful meal, two full plates of food plus garlic bread and a fresh salad with a variety of fresh veggies, for under $20. Remarkable that prices are so high everywhere else but I can get this wonderful meal here for that amount of money. And when we're done eating and I gaze out the window that looks like a beautiful painting, I just can't believe how lucky I am to live here"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Good food. Poor service. Their staff doesn't seem to be trained very well.


I found HAIR IN MY SANDWICH. GROSS


Every time we ask for extra salsa at the register... they forget it and I have to go up to the counter and request it again.... 

Last time we were here we received our meal, one of which was a soup... they brought no spoon. We were asked if we needed anything else and responded with ""an extra plate and a spoon"" - our waitress said she would bring a plate but that the spoons are self serve inside.....

So you're going inside but can't swing by the silverware while getting us a plate? 

I know where the spoons are... we are local, but maybe once we have sat down and gotten comfortable in a restaurant the least a server can do is accommodate us?"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Alway's very friendly staff and clean environment with a nice patio. I always order the turkey (gobbler) burger which is very good. I would rate this place a 5* but there's nothing else I like. If your into salads, organic food or a vegetarian you'll probably love it here."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Been here a couple of times now. The sandwhiches are decent, the other foods are so-so. Service is pretty quick. For the type of food the price isn't a little high. Would recommend it if youre looking for something not greasy and decent."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Great tasting food! The menu had a lot of options with everything from salads to sandwiches and more random stuff. I had the teriyaki sandwich and it was delicious! I didn't need to add anything on it once I get it.Seating can be a bit challenging and inside it gets crowded but theres plenty of outdoor seating. Will definitely be coming back!
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Out of all 3 natural cafes in Santa Barbara county, this is by far the best. The store manager is the friendliest of them all and very welcoming. The food is prepared deliciously (if anything is mistaken -for those with complicated orders and food allergies like mine- they will happily fix it). Atmosphere is modern, simple, calming and clean. I recommend the old town salad (swapping out the guacamole for slices of avocado is what I usually do), the Buddha burrito, the zen and the good karma burger, Buddha burrito,  Mediterranean soup when available, black bean enchiladas (I add Buddha veggies), and the local favorite sandwich. For appetizers I recommend the guacamole and nachos grande. It is very nice that they allow modifications (many without charge). Love this place. Can't wait to come back!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Friendly staff and a clean, cute restaurant in a strip mall. The food was uniformly excellent. We had the veggie lasagna, the eggplant sandwich, the roasted red pepper soup (will make you purr), chicken burrito, and a slice of carrot cake. All of it was perfectly prepared. Highly recommend this spot."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,Overall a decent place but vegetarian vegan options are a bit weak in the flavor category. Just had the veggie stir fry with tofu and the tofu was clay like and not tasty at all.The vegies were over cooked. I do like the Vege Burger options here. Step up the seasoning in the veggie dishes as its not as easy as adding some topically like salt or pepper.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I definitely recommend coming here on a Sunday so you can take a stroll through the farmer's market, located right smack in the front. It's a great way to end your weekend :)

My tummy thanks me every time I eat here! You can definitely taste the freshness of all the ingredients they use.

Their sandwiches are ON POINT. My absolute favorite is the portobello mushroom sandwich - it's the type of sandwich that you can feed to your omnivorous friends (AKA me), and they won't care or feel the need to point out that the ""patty"" is a big juicy mushroom because it's so warm and delicious! The grilled veggie sandwich is also a yummy hit!! 

Along with your sandwich is also a side of chips & salsa, which is sooo good and fresh! 

*Side note: their ice (for drinks, water, etc.) is scoopable, which I think is super cute.

Really friendly service with great vibes. The outdoor seating is perfect if you want to enjoy the wonderful Goleta weather. I do wish they were opened a little bit earlier for the early risers!! But I'm always coming back :) Definitely my favorite go-to healthy place!!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I absolutely love this place! The grilled veggie sandwich was so delicious and makes eating healthy on the go easy and yummy. I also love the cruelty option they give for us vegans and vegetarians, can't go wrong with this place!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Amazing. I go here all the time. Let's just say I have dreams about their mouth-watering portobello mushroom sandwich. 
The place is healthy, affordable, and delicious! Enough said. Check it out."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"For those who desire a well balanced, nutrient rich meal, The Natural Cafe (TNC) is the real deal. 

Offering five types of hamburgers including the Natural Burger ($8.09; with cheese, add $0.79) made with a soy patty, sprouts, grilled red onions and Thousand Island dressing, Zen Burger $8.09; with cheese, add $0.79) with a grain/vegetable patty and the Kelly Burger ($8.99) which is a Gorgonzola cheese topped turkey patty, that is complemented with garlic mayonnaise.

Aside from hamburgers, TNC has many types of food to choose from, including four pasta dishes, three pizza varieties, seven chicken and fish entrees, eleven vegetarian entrees and a kids' menu. 

Good for grown-ups, kids and grown-ups with kids (or vice-versa).


CAUTION-

Although TNC offers dishes that cost over $10, such as the Grilled Salmon Pesto ($12.99), Mt. Fuji Stir Fry ($11.59) and the Veggie Stir Fry with sauteed tofu ($11.59), by far most of the offerings come in at $10 or less.

The ""$$"" indication that most of TNC's dishes cost $11-$30 is misleading and should be changed to a one ""$"" rating."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"We've been regulars of The Natural for years, maybe more like decades. The food is very consistent but has remained unchanged for years. Specials are usually good.

But their new location has really changed our Natural experience. From the garden feel with nice, warm wood tables, chairs, floor and service area, lots of plants and earthy decor, we now get cheapo, fast food tables, intrusive lighting, and a completely uninviting ambience.  We no longer linger and chat over a meal but take it to go. Our kids are big Natural fans from birth and used to request it regularly.  After the first couple of visits, they haven't suggested it and when it was brought up, said they'd rather not.

We're very sad that Natural Cafe didn't stick to its roots with this new location. Now, it just screams, ""Goletans don't deserve what Santa Barbarans get downtown and at La Cumbre."" Thanks for making one of our favorites just another unpleasant Goleta dining experience."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Food is picking up from there old natural but bland style. If you try s special, they are creative and tasty, except pasta because they think ""al dente""something a body shop beats out of your car. 

Besides pasta, things are very tasty. Desserts are terrific"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"LAZINESS AND DISRESPECT , this was my first thought when I walked into this place.
The manager and the rest of the employees don't care if you bring business there!

To the owners-owner: 
The manager has no knowledge about cross contamination and how the food is prepared!!!
 
You  needs to take a bold decision about management and training!
Money is not an end in itself but just a tool."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I've only eaten here once. It's located in the kind of mega-strip-mall that inspires me to write post-apocalyptic novels. However, there is mega parking, so that's a silver nuclear-cloud lining. It seats a lot of people, big space, high ceilings. 

The prices were fair, food was ""clean"" and healthy and 7.5-8.5 out of 10 delicious (I can only judge based on two dishes, pasta and a veggie potato, which was huge), and a large menu. Plenty of veggie options,not sure about vegan, but imagine so.The decor is a tad cafeteria-like and it's one of those places where you wait in line and order at a cashier and take a number. The workers were friendly. The guy who rang us up was super ""alt"" which is very nice to see. This area of Cal lacks diversity, so it was, at least, nice to see a little social diversity. 
Anyway, especially, given the choices in the area, it's 5 stars."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegetarian options at this place, went there twice just because of the food quality...but on the otherside i found employees to be very rude."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,I tried their chicken taco special for the day today and they were really plain and no flavor at all. Took two bites and threw it. I wouldn't go to this place again.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Prettttttyyy....pretty good. Had the pasta primavera. Husband said their chicken is really good so i added it- it was grilled and tasty although this time slightly overdone. Pasta was yummy and came with DELICIOUS garlic bread (seriously the star of the meal) and a side salad which i didnt even get to since the bread and pasta filled me too quick. Portions were not huge, but just right. Ill be back!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I've probably had everything on the menu 2x's and I'm never disappointed. 
Tahini dressing is a must.

Everyone that works there  is super friendly. 
It's clean, quick and easy parking."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Yeeeesssss!!!! I'm so happy to have this place so near to me! It's so yummy and so many heathy options and great options for everybody.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I also wish I could eat here every day--and wish there would be a place like this in Redlands! I popped in for a quick lunch some time ago and was so impressed. BBQ sandwich special was delicious, and they served chow chow, which I haven't had for decades!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I've written about other locations for Natural Café before, but it deserves another endorsement for their Goleta location. A fabulous Greek Salad with grilled chicken on top with lemon dressing was the perfect choice for lunch. The small salad was more than enough for me. Service is consistently great here from the order taker to the delivery at your table. This is the go-to place for a healthy meal with lots of really great selections to fit your mood and apetite."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I frequent this place for lunch and always forget to leave a review. I just have to say the staff here is so incredibly friendly. The food is amazing and the ambiance is very relaxing. This place is always packed for lunch and with good reason! So I recommend calling in your order ahead of time. I highly recommend the eggplant sandwich, the yogi special and the pizzas... all of them."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"This is very solid vegetarian place to add to the small list in the Santa Barbara area. I don't come here very often, but when my parents or other family members are in town and want some friendly, non-scary options, Natural Cafe is a great place to come to. I've had some of their sandwiches (at the Orcutt/Santa Maria location) and most recently had their veggie quesadillas, and they were perfect. I think that some of the food could definitely be a bit more flavorful, which is why I wouldn't give it 5 stars, but on the whole, like I said, it's a solid, safe place to come to if you are vegetarian."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I'm a big foodie , can I say I always fail my weight loss resolution but every time I come here from orange county CA I always know that they cook with the freshest ingredients and make meals according to your diet needs and the orders have more greens than you'll ever get at Mc Donald's so with that being said I really recommend the food here... I leave eating healthy and full and the cooks take their time with the preparation of every dish soo full of flavor and Delicious and the smoothies are amazing the girls make the most delicious drinks ask for Denise when you go she'll take care of you very well , sad I'm leaving back home wish they had more restaurants like natural cafe would really help people with their health goals and keep people on track"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,A fresh reminder of how delicious food can be without the burden on the belly! I had the tempeh tacos! So good and i didn't need seconds! I enjoyed my time here.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Ah, Natural Cafe. Dependable, reliable. I always get the same ol' grilled cheese and it's always delicious. Portions are right, price is fine, and the service is good too. Consistency and cleanliness go a long way with me, clearly."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"This was the first restaurant I tried when I moved into ucsb. I gotta say its a pretty good restaurant.  I ordered a turkey burgers and with all the extras, the burger came out to be 11 dollars. Not bad, my only complaint really is that they didnt serve fries with the burgers. I guess they really take this healthy  thing seriously, lol. In conclusion the food was very filling, and delicious. I would return again since it was healthy, and close to my apt."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"The salads and flourless cakes are very good. :) However, some of the food like sandwiches is way too healthy to be tasty :\ The pita bread is dry/hard and there's no flavor to the sandwiches. The dinner combo like pastas are okay, but nothing great."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"The place is called natural cafe so i was expecting some organic options, fresh vegetables and so on...but instead what we got was microwaved vegetables, soggy and slimy... absolutely disappointing. The people were friendly but the food was definitely not good."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I had a Moroccan vegan soup and an avocado sandwich today.  The Moroccan soup is amazingly delicious and is probably the best soup at Natural Cafe. The sandwich was good too. 

They still have the policy of having to print paper for coupons which is quite against the ""natural"" way of doing things.  The staff were more friendlier this time."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Natural Cafe is a great place for vegetarians or those who are looking for a meal on the healthier side. 

The new location in the Camino Real marketplace is right next to Hollister Brewing. You order at the counter and take a seat inside (it's not an overly large seating area) or outside on the patio, where they have tables with umbrellas and heat lamps for the evenings. 

The menu of appetizers, salads, burgers, pizzas, pastas, etc. has something for pretty much everyone. I like the Yogi Special (sautéed tofu, brown rice, ample side salad with your choice of dressing that comes on the side) and the Zen Burger (veggie patty burger which comes with chips and salsa) also looked yummy. Friends ordered salad entrees and they were enormous! They don't skimp on the portions here. 

I will definitely be back when I'm in the mood for a casual, healthy lunch or dinner in Goleta."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Could eat here every day. Great vegan and veg options and husband loves the burrito and turkey burger. It's a chain but a hell of chain. I never get sick of this place and that's saying a lot
Cause I don't particularly like eating at same places normally. Everything is fre"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,My go to order here is the ranch salad with avocado (of course). Everyone that works there is very friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly. Lots of different options for vegans and vegetarians as well. Might just be my favorite place to grab a salad.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I am always up for a blueberry shake from the Natural Cafe. Also, their carrot cake. Also their pesto pasta. Also all the salads. yeah"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Really enjoyed the zen burger and chicken teriyaki sandwiches here! Food was really fresh and well prepared every single time! I usually get a take out order from them, and they always pack it nicely. Will come back again!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"This restaurant offers you a lot of options, from Salad to pizza/burguers, of course all natural/organic.
The prices are fair and food is delicious! This place really worth the value, actually if they charge me kind 25% I would still think it worth!
The place is cool and always playing a good song, the service is awesome and ppl here are always with a smile on face and also being helpful and atentious
I would Eat here everyday!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Natural cafe has an extensive menu for salads and sandwiches which are very friendly to vegetarians and vegans. They have things like soy bacon bits to put on salads. They also provide plenty of meat options. For example I end up putting grilled salmon on my salad- yummy!

I give it three stars, because it's fine for what it is, but it isn't memorable in any way. It's a good go to option if you're looking for a light lunch and want to sit outside, but there are better options around.

I've had the portobello burger, and it's good and juicy l, but nothing to write home about. I've also had several of their salads. The soup selections aren't bad- they have two options every day.

The prices are a little high in my opinion, but I'm sure the ingredients are fresh!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,I like their new location. Food came out promptly and was delicious. They have a good selection and great prices.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,I love coming here for lunch on the way home from El Capitan canyon campground. It's quick healthy and delicious. The hardest thing about this place is NOT getting dessert because the cakes all are as good as they look!! And they look fabulous.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Still good but damn it ain't cheap! Daughter and I had salads- chicken Caesar for me and East Beach with added salmon for her. I was surprised at the $37 bill before tip, no drinks! I thought maybe the cashier made a mistake but I had declined the receipt and didn't want to embarrass myself it if ended up being correct.

Price aside, the meal was tasty (except for tough, overcooked chicken) and just right in size. (Wish the portion size matched the price bc I could've  taken home leftovers)."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"For being the first time visiting, it was a bit hard to find.
When I called, they picked up promptly and answered respectfully and helpful.
The cashier seemed interested for us to get the right food for my 2 year old.
She customized my order and my daughter loved it!!
Thank you! 
I will definitely will go back again."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Im glad I gave this cafe a chance.
The primo pasta was delicious. I ordered chicken to be tossed over the pasta. For a beverage, I sipped on apple cider vinegar. There was an ingredient of ginger which helped with my toothache."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"I used to love this spot but I will NEVER be returning after today. Last visit I got a salad and the chicken wasn't cooked thoroughly but I thought I would give it another chance. Today I go in and got a salad to go and when I got home the greens were totally rotted so I had to throw the entire salad out! 

I don't know what is going on with quality control but Natural Cafe has lost me as a customer given these recent incidents."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,I was very disappointed about their salad because the lettuce had already started to wilt and appear black. Definitely not going back for salads.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,A nice surprise! Looking for somewhere easy to grab a dinner bite before meeting w folks at UCSB. Delicious turkey burger and chips and salsa that come with are great. Nice atmosphere and music.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Natural Cafe is great. My company orders from here frequently, and they are always on top of our large orders. 

I've tried a bunch of stuff, and liked basically all of it. They have really good sauteed tofu, and I love the lemon herb vinaigrette. I'd recommend the Spiritual Spinach Salad and the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich. They also have a stellar variety of vegetarian options."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"For it's type of place, it's really terrific.  In my teens, my father owned a healthy food restaurant, and I helped to build it from the ground up.  We did a great job (I think), but didn't make it successfully...and closed after 3 years or so.  In our dreams, we would have liked to be as good and successful as The Natural Cafe appears to be.

Love the menu.  The energy is great, healthy, quality ingredients are used, and the service is so nice.  This location is new, kept immaculate, the portions are large, and they have the best ^%$# (darn) tofu ever -- that I can't help to order the Veggie Stirfry ($9.79) with Tofu (add $1.80) nearly every time, at any of the Natural Cafe locations.

This particular visit, I tried the Buddah Burrito with chicken.  Wow.  It was huge and really great with a healthy twist.

Bottom line, if you can't tell, I like."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I came here today right when it opened at 11 AM. This restaurant has you order your food at the cashier, has you seat yourself in any open table, and serves the food to you. 
I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a bowl of Vegetarian Chili ($5.69) that comes with cornbread and honey butter. Sour cream was drizzled on the top and topped with a few green onions. With the rainy, cold weather outside, this chili really hit the spot! It was nice that they had different kinds of seasonings that you can add to the dish yourself."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"The food is yummy for sure, but it's not necessarily affordable. Twenty dollars for a salmon Caesar salad in not a full-service restaurant? It's not like I could eat half and then save half for later (and I'm not a huge eater). So it's a bit too much for me for lunch (and no drink). Also they don't really cut the salad leaves enough so it's tough to shove huge lettuce pieces in your mouth. Makes me sad cause I like the food."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I'm such a huge fan of this place! I really think it is the best place in Goleta to grab a healthy and filling lunch! Although they boast some pretty spectacular vegan and vegetarian options, they have meat dishes as well. I haven't had anything bad here, and the atmosphere and service are top-notch. 

If you're heading here for lunch, I would recommend any of their salads. The full-sized versions are very large, and can reasonably be split between two people. The half salads are still a decent size, enough for a meal. I like the full East Beach salad. It's topped with delish roasted veggies!

I also love going here for dinner, in which case I tend to gravitate towards their pasta dishes (which, spoiler alert, are the best deals on the menu). The veggie lasagna is my favorite! Each pasta dish comes with a ""salad garnish,"" which is really the size of a side salad. The tahini dressing is my preference, but lemon herb is also pretty solid. 

Other things I've had that are excellent: hungry planet burger, soup of the day, stir fry, and veggie tacos. They also have a good carrot cake if you're feeling like some dessert."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Just as good as all the others. A little stark but the food is what you expect. I always get the enchiladas or the chicken Caesar. They are both outstanding. Go to core power next door for a Felix and then come over here for a great meal.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I order a Mr. Natural it was very filling, delicious, and refreshing for those that love greens these is the place to go! Great atmosphere and fast service"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"For good tasting, wholesome food at a decent price and served in a clean, bright, pleasant space, look no further than Natural Cafe. I like this one because it's in a convenient shopping center but manages to be lovely anyways, with its delightful outdoor patio. 

I've eaten at a number of the Natural Cafe locations over the years and can't say I've ever had a bad dining experience. From soups to salads to sandwiches and even Mexican dishes, one can't go wrong."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"How do they make an avocado sandwich taste so good? Yummy, fresh food. Great soups of the day! Good music and the ambience is happy and spacious.. One of my favorite places to lunch when I am in the area."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Great atmosphere, great location. 

Located in a moderate size outdoor shopping center, this restaurant had ample parking in the huge lot in the center of the mall.  We parked close to Home Depot.

My group of 3 arrived for dinner on a Saturday evening at 6 pm.  It was crowded but there were a few tables available inside (mostly 2 seater tables).  It was cold out so the front patio with numerous tables and chairs was empty.  The restaurant was decorated with an earthly feel.  It was simply decorated. The vibe was relaxed but loud from talking patrons.

We ordered at the counter, received a number, and found a table.  The menu contained a good variety of food for everyone.  The menu was divided by groups (sandwiches, burgers, salads, chicken and fish, pizza, and vegetarian entrees.  there were also great selections of beverages and desserts.  Vegetarians options included 3 veggie burgers, salads, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, soups, etc.  We selected the 1/2 sandwich (albacore tuna) and lentil soup, the Natural Burger with lentil soup, and the salmon dinner special with a lentil soup.  The food was brought out together in a timely manner.  The soup was particularly tasty.  The fish dishes were great.  The Natural Burger lacked zest and tasted just like a Boca patty from the market.

Service was friendly and helpful.

The restrooms were single gender and single occupancy.  The women restroom toilet was out of service during our visit.

Overall, definitely worthy of another visit."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Great food! Very healthy and tastes delicious. I love their smoothies especially. Good place for salads as well!
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"I like the vibe this place is going for and they have a great looking menu! We ordered our lunches to go, but I liked the setting and there is tons of seating both inside and outside.  

Albacore Sandwich - pretty good, a little salty. I think they could've used better bread like pretzel wheat so it wouldn't get soggy to fast.  It started falling apart halfway through 

Arugula Salad - nice and refreshing.  It's a pretty simple salad so the dressing made the salad what it was.  I wish the portions were bigger since it was pretty expensive for something I could easily make at home.

The service wasn't my favorite part of the restaurant.  There wasn't a long line, but the cashiers seemed to rush us.  They didn't welcome us or say 'thank you' at all.  I don't know about you, but that leaves a pretty big impression on me especially when the food wasn't amazing.

I would go back to try their baked desserts though!!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Had another great meal here recently. The food is always pretty consistent and the service is friendly. I really can't fault anything here, except maybe that it doesn't seem as clean as it was when it first opened. Management, please make sure it stays clean in the public areas....that's the only way your customers know how to gauge what's happening behind the scenes, so to speak!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,The salads and sandwiches here are off the chain but I wouldn't recommend the chili it's mostly beans and very bland.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Great choice in the midst of Goleta for fresh and natural foods. I had the tostada salad with grilled chicken, which was great, the grilled chicken was especially tasty, and my son had the enchiladas, which he said were the size of two burritos,which he also liked very much. I also appreciate the ""iced tea bar"" with 4 kinds of tea, and lemonade. The portions are very large, so it is also a great value!!!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I've been to their location on State Street a couple of times, but decided to leave a review for this location since I've been here during two graduation days and have stronger memories here.

On this visit, I tried the pasta primavera as well as some hummus, their chicken teriyaki sandwich, and mama mia pizza (because the fun of eating with friends is that you get to try their food). From my previous visit, I think my favorite is their pesto pasta.

Pasta primavera ($12.39): Decent, but very light in flavor. Not surprising, but not an option I would order again.

Hummus with pita ($6.69): This came with cucumbers and grape tomatoes and was very filling. There was a huge amount of hummus.

Chicken teriyaki sandwich ($10.79): Heavy on the chicken teriyaki sauce. Not my favorite, but my friend really liked it.

Mama mia pizza ($11.99): Would totally order this again because their pesto sauce is delicious."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I recommend this spot for anyone into clean eating. The concept is amazing however the service was a bit off. Maybe it's because they were so busy but items were forgotten. For example, the Greek salad was missing the feta cheese.  I had to walk it back to the counter to get it fixed.  Also my smoothie order was sitting on the counter for over 10 minutes. It remained on the counter after I asked about the status of my order. I was told it was coming right up. After walking back to my table I notice that the server picked up the smoothie that had been sitting. Overall, I did enjoy the food and I'm willing to give them a return visit. I'm hopeful..."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I've had hit and miss experiences at other Natural Cafe locations in the past but this Marketplace outlet is the best in terms of consistently good food and good service. 

The menu is pretty varied and it's pretty clean. The food is served quickly and everything tastes like it was just made for you (because it was!) I have a couple of food allergies that have cropped up out of nowhere and they're not the usual suspects of food allergies. 

I'm here often and I really appreciate that I've never had an issue with asking for an item to be excluded from my salad or entree and then finding it in my order. They listen and get the orders right all the time."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,First went to the Natural Cafe on Hollister and loved it. The fresh ingredients make their food delicious and simple. I prefer this new location over the one on Hollister. The ambience is prime and it's in a more lively and friendly environment.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"SO GOOD
Great fresh, healthy food with vegan/vegetarian options! Very inclusive of different eating preferences.
The soups are always amazing and they were my go-to whenever I was feeling sick.
The sandwiches are also good. I haven't ordered anything here that I didn't like.

The service is also amazing. They're so nice, and one time I came in with a huge group and they were very accommodating. I wish I was still in the area because I'd go here all the time."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Had the Gobbler burger and loved it. Very juicy and flavorful. Split Pea soup was also good but not served hot enough. Although the food was a solid 4 stars I found it way to bright and stark inside and for the size of the new location the dining area is quite small.
My dining partner had a salad and was less impressed and consequently ate on my Gobbler which also made me take away a star."

Appetizing presentation, variations in options, relatively healthy (try to ask for sauce on the side), and decent seasoning flavor (as in its just slightly above average but not at all spectacular where you wish for more like a craving). Appropriate portion size.

Service:
Excellent. Greets you, repeat your order quickly, knowledgeable, and the place is kept clean and organized.

Atmosphere:
Amazing. Relaxing and open with great music (classic rock).

Overall:
This place backs up what they claim to be which offers natural food with a cafe feel and i respect that because not many places can do this right. They try to preserve the environment by not being wasteful with paper and plastic but still have all the dining amenities you need."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"The falafel pita was over spiced and dry. The tahini sauce was not recognizable. The main ingredient should be yogurt, but theirs is some kind of salad dressing. We had to return the veggie grill because it was not prepared as described in the menu. The menu said balsamic marinade, but there was none. The turkey burger was ok, but not at all outstanding."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,We were driving from LA to a safe vacay place North and needed to find somewhere to eat that would satisfy momma's Vegetarian love of food and Dad's love of adding a small amount of meat to his lunch. Wow and wow did we hit the bonanza!! It's jaded to find good food that we both love bit Natural Cafe is now our favorite. AND they are so perfect on making us feel safe with the new Covid rules. Ask their advice for what you want to eat...it was all so amazing we can't wait to go back! And leave some room for dessert! Holy Cow... the carrot cake and coconut cake are out of this world different and amazing! You won't be disappointed. This is a 10+ on our a scale.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I arrived at 9 pm closing and they ushered me in with a smile.  I ordered a wonderful Tostado Salad - it was delicious.
I really appreciate the smile and warm welcome at closing time by all the staff and serving me !"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Great spot for huge salads! Love that you can customize the salads with any protein, I added chicken to the Cobb. With veggie bacon, sprouts, feta, and avocado, it was so filling and yummy!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Definitely one of my go to spots I eat at a few times a week for years...Always know what the foods going to taste like and served in timely manner! Whether it's ordering takeout or dinning at one of there locations I'm always satisfied w quality of food, service and overall experience at the natural cafe!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,I don't understand why people like this place it's not good or flavorful.... The tahini sauce is a joke! None of the menu items are authentic or try to be.... I couldn't find this restaurant any less appealing if it gave the food away for free. I would waste any money in this god awful place. Just plan gross.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Love natural cafe: 
food selection and quality, 
service, 
atmosphere 
and now their camino real location is very convenient on the way home from work. 

Sautéed tofu is a great addition to any salad. The east beach salad is great but I wish it came in a half size. 

My guy is definitely a meat guy but he still enjoys the chicken quesadilla or one of the pizzas. I liked the chicken stuffed spud. 

The smoothies are also a sweet and nutritious addition to a meal because they don't have the fillers of other smoothies. 

Natural cafe is my comfort food. My guy knows if I had a rough week that natural cafe will cheer me up. Which makes the convenient location that much more awesome."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Amazing food. Perfect place for vegetarians. Tried the primavera pasta and a plant based vegan burger. It was delicious.

This visit was on a Saturday at 1:00 pm.  Easy parking. Party of 2.  No line. No crowd. Easy seating.  

Very consistent restaurant.  Everything from my previous review stands.  I love it here.  

Both restrooms were in good working  order this time. 

I will definitely be back."

Have a little desert- you deserve it. Really great salads and iced tea is delicious
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"This place is great for someone who is too busy to cook, but doesn't want to feel heavy from eating out. The food is delicious, but also healthy and refreshing. They have a wide selection of sandwiches, salads, pasta, burgers etc. Everything is fresh and makes me feel energized. 

The atmosphere is also very chill and calming. It's nice to go for a date or hang out with friends. There is a lot of art on the walls and they have cute little flowers at every table. 

Their pasta has really interesting shapes. Kind of like curly noodles, but in blocks. The sauces are all delicious and it's very filling. Staff is very friendly and accommodating."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,This is probably my favorite healthy cafe in Santa Barbara. They have a verity of amazing food anything from Vegan lovers to meat lovers they got your fix. Not to mention their sweet employees who do their best in greeting you with a smile every time! 100% recommend
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Despite living in Santa Barbara for 4 + years and hearing great reviews about this place, today was my first visit at the natural cafe! I throughly enjoyed the friendly and fast service, the fresh food, and the great environment.

I ordered the chicken teriyaki sandwich which came with a side of blue corn tortilla chips and red salsa. Total was $10 and it was definitely filling but in a good heart full way. I'm usually not a teriyaki fan as i don't enjoy the sweetness of the sauce but a friend raved about this plate and swears by it so I decided to give it a try. It was absolutely delicious! They have a garlic sauce that makes it amazing. If I come back I would like to try their other dishes, but this is easily a favorite. 

You order first then take a seat either inside or outside with plenty of seating either choice. You grab your napkins and utensils on the side and please be weary of your napkin consumption as this place is very environmentally friendly.

Great place to meet with a friend for lunch, bring an interviewee, or have a work meeting.

Will be back!

fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Love this place! My favorite part of eating here is that there are awesome and yummy choices for everyone, regardless of diet restrictions! They offer so many vegetarian options, it's so easy to please everyone. I've had their salads, sandwiches, appetizers, everything basically and it's all super good! Reasonably priced and a friendly staff, definitely worth a visit!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Fabulous spot for a healthy meal. Plenty of outdoor seating (which is important lately) under the trees so shade optional. You order at the register and you meal is promptly brought out. I ordered the Caesar salad with Salmon added. Good but we're recommend requesting dressing in the side next time. My daughter had the Spritual Spinach salad with tofu. Next time that'll be my choice. Delish!
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,The Goleta location seems to have better food than the Santa Barbara one but great food.

Their flexible menu promotes healthy eating without forcing anything which makes you feel good about eating out!

Ordered my fav Ranch salad with  tahini dress , super yummy and cooked perfectly...add a mid snack of 9grain wedge and Side of garlic mayo and my day is complete!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"This has become the place my family eats everytime they move me to school. It's great because they have vegan and vegetarian food but also omnivorous food.

 2 out of 4 trips I have gotten the tempeh tacos. They don't have v e r y bold flavor but they really load the tortillas with tempeh and it's very filling. The salsa helps and its good. I have gotten the bean enchiladas once and they have less flavor in my opinion, but are decent for a vegan option. I have wanted to try the temale but heard similar opinions, maybe next time.

 Tonight I got the spinach salad which reaffirmed my high rating of the restaurant. The spinach salad has artichoke hearts, olives, carrots, cheese (sub soy cheese!), (vegan) bacon bits, sprouts, and tons of spinach. I got the lemon herb dressing which is really good, not too lemony, tastes somewhat like dill and/or something you'd put on potato salad (okay forget I said that, just try it). The salad was giant and filled me up. Never thought i would like the combo of the ingredients but it was amazing.

Always clean, always nice staff. Wish they had more locations. According to family the flour-less chocolate cake is amazing, so if you're anti-flour try it. They also have coconut cake and carrot cake that looks appetizing."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"I hate to give them anything but 5 stars because I love the food, but my experience has always been horrible. All 4 times I have ordered from there they have forgotten all extras I add AND STILL CHARGE ME FOR IT. I get that things get missed, but to consistently charge me for things I don't receive is absurd, especially on top of their already overpriced items. I always told myself it was just a fluke...but for this to happen every time is either horrible luck or horrible service, and I'm guessing the latter. I wish I could say I was coming back, but 4 frustrating experiences is more than enough for me."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away in a land called IV, their was this falafel stand, I think it was called The Falafel Stand. Anyway, they had the best falafels this side of the Dead Sea. And that's the yardstick I used when I ordered the falafel pita.
The falafels were indeed very good, but were the size of meatballs. The sprouts and tomato were very fresh crisp. If I may say one thing.. a little shredded lettuce goes a long way. The sauce was just ok. Try Greek yogurt as a base.
That said, the staff were very friendly and a big smile greeted us. I will go there again next time I'm out at the Camino real market place. If just to explore more of the menu."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Sandwich was fine but waiting 15 minutes... Not. Overstaffed and under managed, it took the waitress 3 requests before I could get a fork. I decided to go bread less. Same dance as when it was on State St. Lots of dirty tables and staff socializing. No thanks. I'll spend my money where people actually care."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"aesthetic: 4/5 
food: 5/5
service: 5/5

i could rave about this place for daaays. dining out at health-conscious/entirely-vegan eateries can be expensive, especially when you're on a college student budget, but natural cafe changed my mind on this! my housemate and i come here 1-2x a week because their old town salad (specifically the tofu side) is crazy yum and filling, and affordable (~$9) for the huge portion size. 

as for aesthetic + service, the outside patio is also adorable and boho with all of the giant plants and succulents surrounding the tables, and the staff is friendly, as they've been helpful with modifying certain menu items to be vegan-friendly.

with the pandemic going around, i've been postmating their hungry planet vegan burger often, and natural cafe has been very efficient with their home deliveries. for sit-down meals, i normally wait 15-20 minutes max for my meal after ordering, and for delivery, freshly cooked food usually arrives within 30 minutes. overall, i would highly recommend checking out natural cafe - not only is the food well-priced and location just a direct bus ride from iv/ucsb campus, but also and most importantly, natural cafe offers food that will delight anyone having any kind of diet!! :)"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Natural Cafe has become a big part of my transition to healthier eating. They have a lot of great flavor packed combinations that are actually really good for you. They also consistently switch up their lunch and dinner specials, which I appreciate, because trying various foods is one of my favorite pastimes. Their lemon herb dressing is amazing! I usually ask for a side of it and dip the grilled vegetables in it. Their salmon is also consistently cooked extremely well, and we Stan a consistent kitchen.

Feedback wise, tho well cooked, the Salmon/Grilled chicken could use some seasoning! Additionally, I ordered a special a few nights back and asked to sub steamed vegetables for grilled without issue. They just charged for the difference which was cool and expected! I went back the next day, ordered the same meal (the salmon special they had) and asked to sub the steamed for grilled vegetables again but this time they told me they couldn't do that. I was quite confused as they'd done it the day before."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I usually get one thing at the Natural Cafe, which is the Albacore Tuna Salad and sometimes a flourless chocolate cake for dessert. Tonight I wanted something warm and saw that they had Turkey Chili on their menu. Since I make my Chili with ground turkey, I thought I'd give it a try. It just may be my next favorite item to order. It was delish!!  The right portion of beans, turkey and not overpowered with onions as a filler. The broth was flavorful and everything combined made for a very tasty dinner, along with the warm, fresh, moist corn bread. It was so filling, that I saved my side salad for lunch tomorrow. Thank you Natural Cafe for a great meal well packaged to go, a clean establishment and always great service."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,I ordered the Veggie Stir Fry and it was great. It was my first time going there. The staff was super friendly and the place was clean and orderly. I enjoyed my time there. I'll definitely come back again.

fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"WOW - Why it take me so long to go here!? Actually, I do know; I tend to be turned off by places that are advertised as healthy or vegetarian because it just doesn't seem to fit my palate. But thanks to a friend who is vegetarian I stumbled into this place for lunch today and I WAS IMPRESSED. 

Like many in January - I have a ""new year, new me"" attitude I decided to go all in and ordered their Buddha burrito (vegetarian), while my friend ordered their vegan burger. Not only did it look awesome when it was served to us it TASTED fantastic. Is this what it means to eat a plant-based diet? Because I *just* might be able to do it.

They also have a variety of non-vegetarian/vegan items on their menu, but if they can make plants taste this good, why order anything else? Definitely would recommend this place to anyone - herbivores and carnivores alike."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Kristin (small cute blonde) at the cash register was so nice. She checked on our table and cleaned and was super respectful and kind. Some of the best service and great food!

We always enjoy the Natural Cafe.

The giant salads, the fish tacos, the turkey chili. All a very good meal. The specials are very good every time.

The soup choices are plentiful, and the giant whole grain bread makes a really big meal.

The eggplant sandwich is perfect too.

Yes Fantastic deserts. 

Enjoy. Always fresh and delicious. ;-P"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Great food! Healthy and tasty at the same time. Bonus: they make their quesadillas with whole wheat tortillas!
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Quick summary: mediocre food, calming atmosphere, friendly service.

The food is uninspired with poor technical execution. I've ordered Mr. Tofu from the Hitchcock location and the Hungry Planet burger from the Goleta Marketplace location. The tofu dish was dry, bland, and had no balance of flavors. It was some cubes of super firm tofu on brown rice and a few slices of veggies. The burger had a overwhelming note of saltiness with a touch of sweetness from the onion and cheese, and a touch of savoriness from the cheese. But the saltiness was not redeemed. It tasted like the cooks dumped salt hoping to imitate good flavor. The presentation of the burger was fine, nothing special, and the tofu dish looked unappetizing.

The ambiance at both locations makes use of spiritual elements like a Buddha statue as well as lighthearted pop songs. Servers and cashiers are happy and kind.

If you're looking for health food or vegan food, you can do better than this. If you just want a calm atmosphere with happy people, this is a decent option."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Thank you baby Jesus for Natural Cafe! The Esposo was getting super antsy, what with the last 11 months of our lives and whatnot, and decided that, if we were able to work 100% remotely, why on this God's green Earth would we only do that from home anymore?? So, off we went to beautiful Santa Barbara for an entire week. He must have lost his mind in this last minute planning, because instead of booking a sensible Air B&B out there and cooking our own meals for that big stretch, he decided we should stay at the Ritz instead ;-O After our first room service (wherein I obsessively kept calculating in my head how long it'd take me to pay off that meal), I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and made a long list of ""must trys"" for the rest of our time in SB. I'm SO glad we hit up Natural Cafe first! Wow. EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD. And their price-point is totally reasonable for such quality food. They deserve every five star review. Even the service rocks. Throughout the week we had (and was not disappointed EVER): Arugula salad, Natural salad, Grilled Veggie bowl, Veggie Tofu bowl, Veggie tacos, corn bread side, garlic bread side, Roasted Turkey sandwich and don't even get me started on the baked goods! Thank you Natural Cafe! You saved our bottom line that week!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"I've been so happy since this location of the Natural Cafe opened up a few years back! We live nearby and love being able to pick up great to-go dinners that are affordable, healthful, and that our two year old really enjoys as well. The fish tacos, chicken pesto pizza, and kid's chicken taco are probably our favorite dishes. If you're local sign up for their mailing list - they never bother you with a ton of email, instead it's a coupon about once a month to save when you order two meals."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Natural Cafe isn't just lettuce and grass clippings. This place is actually a nice restaurant with great dish choices.  I was flat out amazed at the level of tasty from the soup and salad combo.  The lettuce fresh and the soup delicious.

For the big ass-truck-gun-rack-hauling, naughty mudflap sporting, grill master to the squeezed juice, carbon reduced footprint contentious, Bob Marley smoking, intellectual, Natural Cafe has a plate that will make your taste buds dance.    

Really, this place has changed and is now better than ever.

If you asked me five years ago, I would have told you two stars. Well, three stars if you're feeding a rabbit. 

Today, I am a fan.  The price per plate is fair, the selection is vast and the decor cerebral.  

Great food, great value!"

fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"I REALLY want to like this place but I just cannot bring myself to it. I have gone multiple times and each time the food does not taste very fresh and like frozen food warmed up in the microwave. Cleanliness inside the store is not very good either. Service is eh and outfits are not very professional (white shirts and gray shorts are not very flattering). The ordering sequence is confusing, they would benefit in an overhead board of restaurant favorites, specials, and beverage choices. The menu is hard to read in the light provided and text is a bit too small. 

The food taste is meh. The steamed vegetables were not cooked long enough and were still hard. Flavor is not really up to par with similar restaurants either. Food is not what you would expect. 

I have given it multiple tries, but this place is not for me..."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,I Love the large variety of healthy items on the menu as well as daily specials. I ate here twice and both times the food was tasty and the staff friendly. I like the outdoor seating area under the trees.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"This is our ""go to"" local place to get healthy, tasty food. 
This is a little off topic, so please forgive me for this. I was at your restaurant yesterday (Wednesday) with 3 of my kids  and my granddaughter. I had just finished placing our order when my son, who has epilepsy, had a grand Mal seizure near your drinks section. His actual seizure lasted about 20 or so seconds, but he was postictal afterwards and was very difficult to move. I wanted to publicly thank who I believe was the manager that was there. My son weighs 150 lbs and was semi conscious when we were trying to get him out of your restaurant, but it was very difficult getting him out, but we did. Getting him into my high profile SUV was impossible. You came out and helped us without us asking. You were very understanding and so helpful in such a stressful situation, and I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I just wish I knew what your name is.
My son Jacob is back to his normal self.
Thanks again"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"I get that Santa Barbara is expensive, but with a plethora of restaurants to choose from foodies can afford to be selective. We should have selected another place. Lunch for one, and coffee for my friend was an astounding $19. What did I order for this you might ask? A very average garden burger with a small side of tortilla chips. And a bottle of Braggs vinegar water plus the aforementioned coffee. $19, what a ripoff. Never again will we eat here."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"Took my girlfriend here a couple weeks ago. Good service and great food. Tastes healthy, but also tastes like feel good food. A good balance. I've only heard good things about here talking to friends, you should try it to."

fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,This is a good place if you are looking for a quite place with good ambiance. Pleasant staff and quick service. Food taste was ok.  Tamales were good.  Tofu dish was dry and little salty.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"The Natural Cafe is a great casual restaurant with lots of healthy and sustainably sourced options. My favorite is the Hungry Planet Burger™. In my opinion, this is one of the best vegetarian burgers out there. The taste and texture are delicious and on par with the Impossible Burger, another of my favorites. It'll come with a side of corn chips and tasty salsa.
I also have to mention their desserts. I've had the carrot cake and lemon bars, and while I favor the cake, both a great options for sweet treats after your meal."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"BEST PLACE EVER. Since moving to SB I have found it lacks healthy and quick food places!!! It's mostly just fast food or heavier sit down places. The Natural Cafe is an amazing place to grab and quick bite to eat that is healthy or make a sit down meal out of it!!! The quality is fresh and clean! THE side CHICKEN is fresh and moist, And SUPER GOOD. Tuna Sandwich is also great, and the Caesar salad is bomb (the dressing is really good). HIGHLY RECOMMEND. My favorite restaurant in SB. Deserves 5 starts. No complaints."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Heaven for a vegetarian.  I would recommend the Tempe Tacos which were always my favorite but I was told they no longer serve.   The Spiritual Spinach Salad is another favorite.  If you feel like treating yourself the Carrot Cake is out of this world yummy!

fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Usually a pretty regular patron as a local it's usually a go to spot.  Brought my team there for lunch today and was bothered by how skimpy they Goleta stores policy has evolved especially on the sides. Ordered a vegetarian burger and the side was seriously under-portioned.  Asked for a few more blue chips and salsa and was answered with a disinterested and rather cold request to pay more $ for chips and salsa!  At 15$ for a burger you guys shouldn't be so frugal with chips and salsa, kind of pathetic.  Many restaurants in the area happy to provide this at a customers request e.g los agaves etc.  one of the cheapest items to keep simple requests fulfilled with pride.  Never had problems at the Hitchcock location.  Probably won't ever take the team to the Goleta location for lunch.  Usually not a harsh reviewer but the ambiance totally needs some love, best of luck natty cafe."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,Did both locations -- Goleta and DT SB.  I liked the Goleta location better.  Nice outdoor dining.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"I've been a Natural Cafe customer for many years. The thing that keeps me coming back is the fact that they have some decent vegan options. It's not always easy to find a proper vegan meal at restaurants. Anyhow I am pleased that they have healthy, filling and tasty vegan options here. 

I've noticed inconsistencies between the different Natural Cafe locations. I believe the Hitchcock location is the best quality. This location at Camino Real Marketplace isn't quite up to par with the Hitchcock location for some reason. The main thing is that their portions are slightly smaller here.

Recently I placed a phone order here for several people and the girl who took my order repeated it back to me to confirm that she got it correct. She did indeed repeat it back to me perfectly so I felt secure that there would be no glitches. However when I went to pick up the food they had completely forgotten to make one of the entrees and they put the wrong sauce on another entree. The girls working did apologize but I had to wait several more minutes for them to make the entree they forgot about. They still charged me for that entree which rubbed me the wrong way. That entree should have been comped given the fact that they forgot to make it and that I had to wait longer for them to correct their error. 

Whatever, I'll probably still come back here periodically when I'm too tired to cook and happen to be in the area."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,This place is delicious! Highly recommend. I had a salad and it was wonderful. I can't wait to try something new next time I'm in town.
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"If you are tired of heavy, greasy food, try Natural Cafe. It's located in a spacious area with easy and free parking. I've avoided coming here because I thought it was a hippie vegan place, but, boy was I wrong by Judging a book by its cover! Natural Cafe serves salmon and chicken, and non-vegetarian items too. For the vegans, there are items to choose from...but for those craving clean and fresh protein, you can also be satisfied by dining here. Basically, everyone in your family can be happy, no matter what their diet may be.

They have quite a large menu of items to consider, from soups, salads, sandwiches, bowls, salmon, and even, enchiladas and burritos. I like their variety. There is a commonality between all the dishes: you won't have to suffer from a toxic food coma because the food I've experimented with so far, is served fresh and the food is pretty clean. (Little grease, no deep fried stuff, not overly salted, etc.) The service is also very quick and the portions are quite generous. The prices are average for a casual, California restaurant. 

If I were to describe classic California cuisine to an International friend, I would probably refer to Natural Cafe to describe the kind of various and healthy food that Californians gravitate towards. Come here if you don't know what to eat but want to leave without feeling guilty!"
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"My experience at Natural Cafe was mixed. I came as part of a large group, and after reading the reviews I was excited to see what they had to offer. Immediately after walking inside, I was a little disappointed as the atmosphere reminded me of a Souplantation. I ordered my food (the Killer Chicken Quesadillas) and it took about 15 minutes to come, but I was on the luckier side of my group. They were good, but over half the plate was a tasteless salad.For others who simply ordered grilled cheeses (a very simple meal) it took almost 30, and it's not like the place was packed. Two of the waitresses seemed rather confused and kept walking around aimlessly and looked lost. They gave the wrong food to other tables a few times. They also asked us if we were doing okay, and my friend who still hadn't received her food told them she hadn't and they told her it was coming (in a very rude/sassy tone) and then ran off to go make it. I tasted some of my friends milkshakes and it had a distinct soy taste, even though there was no mentioning of it being soy on the menu. 

Overall: The food was decent but the service was poor."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"If I could eat at the Natural Café everyday I would, that's how good it is!

They have a nice selection on the menu of soups, sandwiches, salads, pasta and vegan dishes to choose from. They also offer smoothies and fresh juices. Check out their on-line menu to get an idea of the delicious meals they offer here.

My go to choices are usually the grilled chicken Caesar salad and the teriyaki chicken sandwich. I'm not sure what they marinate their chicken in but it seriously has me addicted! The Caesar salad comes with avocado, tomatoes, homemade croutons, and grilled chicken. I usually order a half size since the full size is pretty huge! They have generous portions here, just FYI when ordering. The teriyaki chicken sandwich is served on their freshly baked bread and piled high with chicken tenders, sprouts, lettuce, cheese, and tomato. It also comes with chips and salsa. 

For the turkey lovers they have a delicious gobbler burger! It's always juicy and the patty is a good size, they don't skimp here.

My son loves this place too and it's very kid friendly! He usually orders the La Dolce Vita pizza. It has a house-made pesto sauce, jack cheese, tomato, and feta cheese. Not your average kid pizza but he loves it and that's all that matters, but they do offer other choices for the picky ones.

Give this place a try if you are looking for a healthy, delicious meal."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,negative,"Tried a couple things here. None were good. Today put me over the edge though and I will not be back. Terrible service. Couldn't get the right food or the right price figured out. Ran out of countless things on the menu. I ordered fish tacos and I would've been happier with a fish stick. All they put on those soggy tortillas was a tiny bit of over cooked fish, carrots, cabbage, and drenched it in watery salsa. Served with soggy chips."
fAiPD2OIEm9wtS7uJqzu5Q,Natural Cafe,American,positive,"It's rare you find a restaurant that is so consistent, reasonably priced, and healthy. This is my go to for everything especially during Covid when restaurants were closed or things were off menu they always made a great environment for customers and kept everything on the menu and staff employed! I eat here about 3 times a week and have been for many years now"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Stopped here last week while in the area from Burbank. Had read about it on Trip Advisor. It is in a great location, quiet, peaceful and cool under the shade of the big old trees. For its location and it being noon on a Thursday we were surprised to find there was literally only one table open when we walked in. Food is served pretty quick though so it didn't seem anyone was really waiting. 
Based on reviews we had read, my hubby had the tri-tip sandwich. I ordered the buffalo burger. I have to say that was one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. As usual, we traded tastes of our orders. My hubby was so jealous of my buffalo burger and I heard about it several more times throughout the day, that he should've got the burger. The tri-tip was quite dry, and it was literally just the meat on bread, big bread.  The horseradish sauce (served on the side) was very tasty though.
For the tri-tip, I give a 3, hubby gives a 4. We both give the buffalo burger a definite 5++.

Either way, worth checking out if you want something with a unique atmosphere and that is away from town but not a long drive. Very peaceful."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"So it is a good friends birthday today and we all met up here. This place has a great, homey feel. It wasn't crowded at all. 

The service was prompt and friendly, my burger was good, not great. Menu said it's charbroiled...seemed more like pan fried, and the meat was well done / dry. Oh well. My buds and I were all having a good time.

Went down to the river and actually found some water!

Good times on Paradise road."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"LOVE this place and have a constructive suggestion.
I have to start by saying I've loved this place for several decades and will love it forever! However, on my last visit while we were eating inside the restaurant, I picked up a visitor that was not appreciated one bit--a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER on my purse. I noticed it as I was picking my purse up to leave and found I had set it on a HUGE web. As I looked closer, that web was not alone--there were many. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get rid of these and clean regularly. I would like to eat my meals stress free! I would love to help clean this amazing place anytime."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Little did I know there's an alternate route heading deeper into Santa Barbara County with the 154, and perhaps the one of the things that make the little detour worth the drive is making a stop into this quaint little spot. 

The tavern used to be an old stagecoach stop back in the days people used actual horsepower to power their transport, and the original structures seem to have been kept intact from those days. The clientele mostly consists of people who like to take their transport of choice and drive it around with people who have similar transports of choice as they (READ: bikers and people with cool, classic cars). The place itself is split into two structures: the tavern and the restaurant. 

We were there for lunch, so we got to sit in the room with the big window and HUGE fireplace. The menu is fairly small but offers a nice selection, and I went for their standard, famous chili (I dare not try their ""fancy"" chili with black beans and wild game including rabbit...I don't eat the bunnies :C ), and I decided to have it atop a plate of fries. Very very yummy. I had a lavender martini to go with it, which was made with  fresh lavender picked from the outside! That was okay. The winner, however, was The Smuggler, a spirited dessert coffee drink made with creme de menthe (or peppermint schnapps?). Now I'm a HUGE mint fiend, and I already expected it wouldn't be minty enough for me, but surprisingly perfectly minty! 

The prices of everything isn't a great deal, but it's still pretty fair.

I took a peek into the actual tavern, which was pretty cool looking. I'd gladly have a drink in there, or outside the place, as you can do and would want to do on a nice day as it was when I went, but by no means am I going to have a hankerin' to drive allll the way over there just to have a few cold ones. All the same, if ever I'm the area again, I wouldn't hesitate upon the suggestion to go here (READ: I'd more likely go here before I go to Pink's again)."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is truly a hidden gem of a place up up in the mountainous windy roads in Santa Barbara.

The place looks like an old cabin from the outside, and as soon as you enter the door, the first things that you'll notice is the dim lighting and the real fire in the fireplace, crackling away. There is a super old rustic feel to the decor, and the bear hide hanging across the wall really completes this place as an old rustic tavern for weary travellers...but in this case, it was more for locals and tourists. 

The food was interesting as we ordered the rabbit, the elk, and venison meats! To my surprise, nothing was gamey and the meat was actually tender and juicy. 

This was definitely a good experience and as many others have mentioned, it is a good place for a romantic date and/or it is also good for a group of friends to hang out and relax.

Check it out!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is amazing.  The area is gorgeous and awesome decor.  We usually just buy a tri-tip sandwich outside but today we sat indoors and we were not disappointed.  The onion rings are bomb, the wild game chili and The charbroiled venison steak sandwich was awesome.  This place is well worth the drive and the wait."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I had the pleasure of dining in this rustic setting after years of hearing about its charm. The setting & the excellent cuisine did not disappoint! I had the New York steak & my friends had a variety of other entrees & we were all pleased with the quality of our choices! I hear that weekends with music make this place great fun! I can't wait to go back!

The BBQ beef sandwich is a classic.

This is your place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place has been around for a long time, established back in 1865. Used to be the route, by stagecoach, to Santa Barbara from the Santa Ynez valley. I have been wanting to go for years and since we were in the valley celebrating her birthday, thought we would try brunch. We arrived at around 11:30, were handed lunch menus. Found out it was either breakfast till 11:00, lunch then a dinner menu. Lunch was good, had the burger, but was craving eggs.
Our lunch was very good, our server seemed to have wanted to be else where, she seemed a little pissed off. The tavern was amazing, just thinking of the history of that place, the kinds of people that came into the canyon from there hard stage coach travels. 
Enjoy the drive."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Braving the twisting road and hiking down to get there (NO parking.)we were met with a what i will call; THE REST STOP. If your idea of a ""Special Night"" out involves sitting in the dirt on tree stumps watching LA poseurs vaping after all-day wine binging sounds fun, this is your kinda place. Their walk-in hut offers beer only, no place inside to sit and relax. The outdoor BBQ sandwiches feed the crowd as they stare at the road to see who arrives next. The band was good, but were crammed into a corner of the dirt, near the beer hut with no dance floor.The only place of solace is the Tavern itself, and a charming respite from the outside. My ribs were tasty, but my husband's fish entre was a big disappointment. The servers were tense feeding the crowd on a holiday weekend. In short, I will never be back. The whole vibe just sucked."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I've been here several times for dinner and for breakfast (which is only served Saturday and Sunday.)  The food is always good, the atmosphere can't be beat, but the service is consistently sub-par. 
I went for breakfast just recently and the food was good, I ordered the french toast, and my wife ordered an omlette.  Both tasty and fairly reasonably priced, at least comparable to what you'd pay anywhere else for a decent breakfast.
On to the service:  Somewhere after topping my coffee off a couple times we seemed to be forgotten.  After finishing our meals we proceeded to sit and wait for a couple to-go boxes and our checks for a good 20 minutes.  During which time a couple waiters/bus boys walked past us.  My wife told me to motion for the check, but I don't want to have to do that.  Normally I'm a decent tipper, 25% no problem, but I consistently get poor service here and it's always from the SAME WAITER.  This time I was fed-up it and I left exact change.  I'm tired of feeling obligated to tip even if the service is sub-standard.
In summary:  Good food, awesome atmosphere,  poor service."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I went here 5-7 years ago.  I remember it being very remote and a flashback to the 1800's.
The food was different - woodsy - gamey but good.  They served venison, duck, rabbit, sweetbreads, etc.  
The ambiance was cool.  It was like entering someone's house - in the 1800's.  
I want to go back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Love dining here.  From the restaurant and the unique meat options to the tri tip barbecue I am always pleased.  The service and staff are wonderful!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I went back here this year.  The food is even better than I remember!  It really has a lot of history.  Cool place!!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a great place.  The history and the secluded location alone make it great but the food is actually terrific.  Great fish and steak.  You have to try this place.  It's like traveling back in time, just wonderful, especially for kids to enjoy the grounds and the hisotry of it.  It would be best to come here during daylight hours so you can tour the site and see everything they have.  After dark, it's very hard to see anything since they do not  have a lot of light here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I had no idea what I was stepping into when I walked in. The restaurant has closed rooms rather than being open concept. It looked so small at first! But if you come with a large enough party, maybe you'll be able to get a room for yourselves. The restaurant has a pioneer hunter-Native American history kind of feel. It was enough to make me feel like I went back in time. They also have real fire places throughout the restaurants, which I enjoyed.

The restaurant is known for featuring game animals on their menu. I went at dinner time, and they had wild boar, venison, and rabbit. The dinner menu also featured fish, chicken, pork chop steaks, lamb, and ribs. I had the rabbit, which I thought was okay. They took the meat off the bones and prepared it in a way to make ""scallions."" It was kind of tough and hard to chew. I have had better rabbit at other restaurants. I had a bite of the venison, and it was delicious. It didn't have a gamey taste, so don't be afraid to try it! Dinner also comes with a basked of bread, salad, chili, or soup of the day. 

The staff was friendly and honest. When asking about the menu, the lady who took our order told us her favorites, what was popular, and which meals were smaller compared to others. 

Warning: For those who have their smartphones surgically attached to their hand, you do not get service out here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a find this place is! Wild game on the menu, cooked perfectly, a great local wine list, live music at the bar, and just a great vibe thru this old ass wood building...you have no reason not to come here, unless you suck"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Ive been coming here since I was a little kid-my grandparents  live in the Santa Ynez Valley in Santa Barbara County. Google cold springs tavern and make a day trip to Solvang and the surrounding wineries. Great tri tip sandwiches! just an amazing HIDDEN restaurant. Yes it's kinda off the beaten path but you finally find it-you'll be very amazed!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I'm not sure who will mind the scenic route, but we all know we make that trek for just the juicy tip... TRI TIP that is! I go for tip but I stay for the music, and the bar filled with liquor! Why would I leave! Let's not forget about the sauces, and the onion rings... Is it Sunday yet?"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Our experience was lackluster to say the least. The waitress got the wrong orders and repeatedly ignore our request to change it. she kept asking, ""do you want more coke?"" when she passes by. 

looking at other table getting the food they ordered, and savoying each bite as they chow down those juicy meat, kept us wondering: ""what if we got what we wanted to eat?""

yes, this is a rustic tavern, enough said."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,So after a nice bicycle ride with a girlfriend of mine I decided to go to Cold Spring Tavern. I work at a hotel so it is a place I do recommend my guests. The reason I am going 4 star is because the food made up for the service. There was this surfer looking dude who seemed to be my waiter but I couldn't tell who my waiter was. The only guy who seemed to be paying attention was a sexy bearded guy (he also helped get the place 4 stars). I think he's the best waiter they had that day. I know at dinner the service is always exceptional. So my advice is definitely go for a dish with some sort of meat. The steak was out of this world and their ribs are out of this world. Love the chili. But at lunch they need to improve their service. I am a good tipper because I work in service industry but I can't really tip the same when folks seem oblivious. I like really attentive waiters and waitresses. Those are the best. By the way the cheesecake was phenomenal!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Came to try out the restaurant with the boyfriend and his parents and was pleasantly surprised by this small, dark, intimate spot. He'd been really eager to try it out since we'd heard so many good things about this place, and I'm glad we came. They have excellent food, fascinating atmosphere. The stuffed animals, mounted heads, and antlers were a little unsettling at first, but once you get used to them (after the initial ""Gah!"") they kind of grow on you. 

The restaurant is really small (reservations definitely recommended), and the service can be slow (when we came there was a single woman serving all the tables), but it's all part of the charm. You come for a slow leisurely dinner, and the food, setting, and pace are all part of that experience. We ordered the appetizer platter, which came with charbroiled shrimp, venison sausage, and artichoke hearts. Sooo delicious. For an entreeI got the rabbit medallions, which came in a lovely savory sauce, mashed potatoes, and vegetables. BF and his mom both got the venison, which they raved about. Exquisite! Drinks are tall and strong. Almost dangerously so. 

Be careful with the drinks, the drive back to town in treacherous! And take the time to read the entire menu. Lots of comedic gems. And the bathroom is outside. There is plumbing though, but still kind of creepy!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Just a treat to go here. A very unique dining experience. We stopped off on the way to wine tasting in Los Olivos and had a lunch. It was Sunday and they were BBQ tri-tips outside, so naturally we ordered those. I also sampled their venison chili. Both dishes were quite good. I found the venison chili a bit under developed in terms of the chili and spices, good but as if they had not had ample time to really settle in and develop. The tri-tip was excellent but the sandwich was a tad  basic and underwhelming. However the service and the setting is so fantastic and so superb, it's an old cabin that was a stop for travelers back when, that this pushed the rating to a 4. Bring the food up a notch and it would be a 5 in my books. 

Definitely worth going to but it can get really crowded, which is a good sign but you might have to be prepared for a wait. No problem, hang out in the canyon under the trees and let the day take you!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I heard somewhere that this place is one of Oprah's favorite restaurants if she's feeling a little bit adventurous.  I'm kind of bewildered.  Maybe I heard wrong.
The place is quite an attraction, I'll give it that.  It's almost like you're visiting Disneyland's Frontierland.  We went during lunch time so the atmosphere was more casual and rustic.  I do hear that during dinner, it is more romantic.  
The drive to this location is quite scenic and windy up into the hills of Santa Barbara.  And the place is tucked away alone all by itself off a side street.  During the Sunday lunch period, it's a frequent stop for Harley riders.  It can get super duper crowded cause the space is quite limited.
We ordered the Beef Dip sandwich and the BBQ Babyback ribs, plus their famous chili.  All the dishes were very good.   Definitely better than average.  
I would recommend it just for checking it out at least once for lunch, and once for dinner.  But other than that, it's okay."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I first dined here for dinner about 3 years ago and have since gone back a handful of times...Just realized I've never checked in or written a review! Ive coulda been the Duchess already! LOL... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! Very romantic...Service has always been excellent! The free bread is sooo delicious!! So is the chili and filet mignon... Food is homemade and fresh! And the Tri-tip on Sundays is truly the best Tri-tip sandwich I've ever had...this is a must try, especially for dinner..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Cannot believe this adorable spot tucked away in the mountains. The tri tip sandwich did not disappoint. Not sure I even got a photo of it before it ended up in my tummy.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is like a trip into Little House in the Big Woods, which automatically gives it a couple stars. 

I have heard that their tri-tip sandwiches are fantastic and was prepared to order one for my 9am breakfast (and what), but it wasn't on their breakfast menu...bummer. 

I ended up going with their build-your-own omelette.  This baby came with some cheese, bell peppers, mixed veggies,  mushrooms; and for the sides, home fries, and your choice of carbs. I went with the maple bread, but I would recommend the biscuit and gravy. I stole some of my friend's and it was awwesooome( said w/ vibrato). My maple bread was dry and just, meh. I would also recommend getting chili beans on your omelette. Once again, I didn't order them myself, but I stole some from my friend and they were oh so good. 

So, for the location and food I give it four stars. Minus one star because they forgot to put the bacon in my omelette and because it was freakin' freezing up in that log cabin. Yeah, I know it's supposed to be all frontier style, but some central heating would do this place some good. So, just plan on bundling up if you're getting there early."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I would go to Cold Spring Tavern for the experience alone. The excellent food, service (Marcos and Rafael were fantastic), and atmosphere are cherries on top of an already amazing establishment. I look forward to my next visit!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Went here Easter of 2018 for the first time and had a blast! I absolutely love it here and plan on returning before I move. We went Sunday evening and the place was definitely booming. If you just want to order the tri tip sandwich (which I highly recommend because it was delicious) you won't need a reservation. I believe they stop serving the tri tip around 5, but I could be wrong. I made reservations for dinner in case my friends wanted something besides tri tip. Overall, they enjoyed their dinner but I think they would have been happier with just the sandwich because it was on point. We stayed to enjoy the atmosphere and live music. This place didn't disappoint."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"The restaurant experience is really about the environment. We were seated in the back room with Mexican pop music carrying through the windows... completely killing the mood. Food was decent, stuffed mushrooms way over done/ chewy, halibut over cooked, veggie stuffed raviolis were kind of gritty. 

The soup was amazing and strongly recommended. For $100 it was more of a one and done place. Would go back for the outside bar area, but not the restaurant."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a great little place. I totally found this place by accident when on a road trip up to San Luis Obispo. I just passed Santa Barbara and was starving for food. My trusted GPS pulled up this place for me. 
The waitstaff was extremely friendly. The food is excellent even if you are not in the mood for heavy meat. There are lighter things on the menu such as quiches and tasty salads. They also have a very nice wine and beer menu. It is not extensive, but it is all quality. 
Parking is a bit weird, since there is not a big lot and you may have to park on the side of the twisty road. defiantly worth the trip."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is a real hidden gem... literally... emphasis on hidden. Off the beaten path, you won't find this place unless you are looking for it. It is a old historic stage coach (mud wagon)  pit stop converted into a nice little restaurant.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Got there at quarter to 3 and the restaurant closed at 3. Waited inside for ten minutes to be told we couldn't order anymore. Kind of annoying that I'd been standing there patiently for ten minutes instead of rudely just jumping in. I eventually was allowed to order a kid's grilled cheese which was huge and excellent. I really wanted a veggie burger but was told the kitchen was too backed up. It came with fries too and those were cooked really well. We shared onion rings and they were ridiculously good but you can't eat a whole order yourself. I feel like one order is good for four people to share. The bf got the tri tip (which is why we went there) and loved it. 

The reason for the three rating though is that the bathrooms were disgusting and the trash was overflowing from all the bins. 

Great live music plays and everyone who works there is super chill. Beautiful views on the drive up too!

Parking can be tricky but it's worth the walk."

As we approached the tavern there were so many people there that we had to pass it up. On our way back through the area the following Thursday at 5 pm we decided to give it another try. We lucked out. Now there were all of 15 people there so there was no wait. Service was fast and friendly. My husband had the famous tri tip sandwich and I had the pork ribs. Both were messy and delicious. Pick the right time to visit and you won't be disappointed.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"The drive into the restaurant was spectacular, and it is a super fun place to pull into and visit. The dining experience however was the opposite of spectacular. 
We dined with our daughter (who is very used to restaurants)- I would not recommend this restaurant for children going forward. It is a very quiet restaurant and her normal happy toddler chatter was very out of place- any level of music or normal conversation would have easily drowned her out. Another couple even commented to us that they felt uncomfortable to talk in the restaurant. 
My husbands peppercorn steak was literally all peppercorns. He ended up needing to scrape off the sauce to eat any part of the meal. My crab ravioli was a confusing combination of flavors that ended up only tasting of the vegetables surrounding the ravioli plate.  
Both my husband and I do not feel that the 4 star rating is accurately representative of the food quality- especially compared to the neighboring food choices."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Ohhhh...   Where to begin?   This place is an American treasure.   It's like stepping back in time.  Warm, romantic and unique.   The food is as unique as the restaurant.  I have been to this Tavern for a meal during the day and night.  The only thing I would suggest but it's not the fault of the Tavern, is at night you might want to put some bug spray on if you want to linger outside.   After all you are out in the beautiful woods"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"After all the great reviews I thought this place was going to be awesome!! 
We went in for dinner and were in a small room with 3 other tables... The waitress for the other 3 tables was a young lady and we had a man!! We ordered an appetizer which was delicious (the venison stuffed mushroom) this came out quick! 
We waited for the soup and salad we had ordered and that took FOR EVER!! The table that came in after us had their entree and we still did not receive our meals! Waiter no where in sight!! 
The tablet next to us finished eating and we were just receiving out soup and salad! The wait for out entree was super long as well!! The food was bland and I'm not sure I'll be back or recommend this place :("

The History, the environment, the drinks, the tri-tip sandwich, the music, and the full sit down restaurant.  Whatever mood I'm in; CST has a solution for me!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern has stolen my heart. Not only is it picturesque, cozy, and serves delicious food and drink, but their vegetarian options are delicious! I had the vegetable ravioli and while I was not expecting much at all, this was not your typical throw-a-bone-to-the-vegetarians meal. The vegetables were perfectly cooked, the ravioli was great, and the sauce was delicious. Paired that with a great basic green salad, fresh bread, and a few nice glasses of wine, and I am one happy girl. Everyone at my table raved about the food and the ambiance. We all vowed to bring friends and family back whenever we're next in the area. This is the kind of place you talk about for days afterward. I can't wait to return!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Great hidden tavern grill. Wonderful old place with early 1800 history. Original chili was yummy!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place was in the middle of nowhere.  Some random ass log cabin.

It literally is a log cabin - with separate rooms within the one restaurant.  Probably USED to be a house!

We ordered rabbit, elk, pork ribs, and stuffed chicken.  My personal order was split between elk/ribs, but I tried everything.  Everything was delicious.  Elk is lean and very juicy.  Rabbit is.. well, tasted somewhat like chicken.  I really liked the ribs.  Chicken was very good too.

Not sure if I will ever order elk or rabbit again, but I definitely enjoyed my sample.  I ordered the elk just to say that I've eaten it.

Free cheesecake for dessert (Birthday celebration).  Mango something cheesecake?  Wow!  Great!

I understand that reservations are necessary - probably busiest between 530pm-7pm.  We arrived at 7pm and it seemed like things were dying down.

Rightfully so because driving out of this mountain it is pitch black and you are driving around winding curves.  If you do not know where you are going or are not from the area, be prepared with a map.  I felt like our drive home was different than the route we took getting there.  Maybe because I couldn't see anything."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Was in the area and lucky to have found this place. About 150 years old. Nostalgic setting with some decent food. Waitstaff was nice and accommodating. Amor had the tiger shrimp with saffron linguini and I was looking for an entree salad with their famous tri tip. Both dishes did not disappoint. So yum. The Italian blue cheese dressing was on point! The horseradish both the house made with apples for a milder flavor and the fresh grated horseradish for sinus numbing spiciness were sooo good. Ambiance whisks you away to another time
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Use to come here a lot, last two visits were not good, seated us next to the bus station and had to listen to the slaming of silver ware most of the night, food took forever for the two of us, while a table of eight who ordered after us got their food first. Food was cold and over cooked. Waitress looked about twelve and had the experience of that, She was very inattentive and looked as if she was heading to a keg party in IV. Promote the busboy, cause he was awesome. Next time we went to see my friends band play (to find out they had cancelled them) Staff appeared unhappy and stressed when we walked in, they were not very welcoming , bartender looked up and just kinda glared at us to the point we changed our mind about Dinner and left. If you are wanting to visit this place...come up for the tri tip sandwiches, they are worth the drive, but I do not recommend the food in the Restaurant..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Probably the coolest outta the way spot you will ever come across in Socal.  Take a girl here from Los Angeles and stop by for breakfast and then keep heading north to wine country.   I personally have noy tried the breakfast but looks great.  Ive been here for dinner.   Good quality with the atmosphere to match.  Live how this place is smack dab in yhe middle of a forest down a dark windy road.   Feels like its a place no one knows about but the locals.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A great atmospheric place to take out-of-towners for brunch, and it's not a tourist trap.  Our meals were scrumptious.  This place is legit."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"what a gem! CS Tavern is an excellent destination date or family outing. On a windy road above Santa Barbara, the tavern is an actual old stagecoach stop. The original buildings sit in a picturesque lush creek hollow. 

Our food was great, well cooked high quality cuts of beef and venison served with fresh bread, well cooked asparagus, great salads, and killer garlic potatoes. we're not experts, but it seemed like a good selection of wine and we enjoyed our bottle.

It was pretty hot on the June night we were there. So hot in fact, we corked our bottle early and took it outside to finish it. The service was fine but not amazing.

Definitely worth the effort to check out this bit of California history!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is one of my favorite places - EVER - restaurant, bar, or otherwise.

Finding it is half the fun.
The food is pricey, but absolutely superb - so you get what you pay for.  The atmosphere is undeniably unique, incomparable to anything else, and totally awesome.
Be sure to visit the bar, which is a separate little rustic tavern that often has great live music.

If you don't go here, I assure you - it's you who's missing out."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"TRI TIP!

I dont know when they DONT serve the trip tip but I guess im lucky cause its always there.

Drive up the mountain, grab a beer and a tri tip and enjoy the nice day."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Food: Wife had the grilled vegetable salad (pictured) - we both enjoyed it. Chili cheese fries - it's chili on fries, what more needs to be said? (Yummm!) I had the tri-tip sandwich - A-OK (didn't enjoy as much as some reviewers did, but wife said it was good). 

Atmosphere: this is a cool place worth the stop. If you're deciding whether to have lunch here, definitely DO. 

I would recommend Cold Spring Tavern to anyone traveling north of Santa Barbara. It's a nice pit stop on the way to or from Solvang."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What an unbelievable find.  Who would have guessed such a great place hidden in the woods of the Santa Barbara mountains.

Rich with history as the building is some 160 years old, and apparently where Wells Fargo used to come through.  Food was great and priced right, and the the inside felt exactly what it must've felt like to dine a couple hundred years ago.  Me and my dinner cohorts almost fought over the artichoke appetizer.  Steak was great, service was good, great ambiance.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What's my favorite food?  BARBECUE!  What's my favorite sound to listen to while eating my favorite food?  VROOM VROOOOOOM!

That's right, ladies and gents, this backwoods gem is straight out of Easy Rider... you half expect to turn and see Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda eating at the table next to you.  Not Jack Nicholson, unfortunately... although he's all of our favorite character, George Hanson was beaten to death in his sleeping bag.  Ah, and so went the leftist movement.

Anyways, back to the review.  You drive up the highway past Santa Barbara, and wind up a beautiful hill and into the wine country.  Turn off on an easy to miss left turn, and then go right down into a heavily-wooded canyon.  

Cold Spring Tavern originated as a coach stop in the mid-1800s, and the buildings all (at least) appear to be original.  Water damaged wood structures with the clear evidence of termite infestation.  Now it's a hot spot for motorcycle riders (both the original gangsta freebird riders and also the rich dudes with a bike or the crotch rockets), old guys with really sweet cars, and also the everyday Joe who just wants some damn good barbecue.

If you go on a day that isn't Sunday, you will have the option of a variety of reasonably-priced sandwiches, ribs, chicken, and pork.  Sunday afternoon is really the time to go, however.  A MASSIVE Samoan guy manning a barbecue, and piling huge sandwiches full of beautifully cooked tri-tip.  The barbecue sauce has a little kick and is delicious.  Even the horseradish (of which I am not usually a fan) is a perfect compliment to this sandwich.  Get two of them, trust me, and for $6 or so a pop this is a deal that can't be beat.  Sloppy, tender meat, perfectly complimentary sauces, and fresh rolls that are other-worldly.

And then sit around, gorge yourself, have a few drinks and enjoy the live music.

This is a place where you go to be yourself... no one is judging you, because everyone is there for one reason and one reason only... great food and a unique atmosphere.

If you're going for dinner, make sure to bring a full wallet, because the prices escalate quickly.  Gone are the rib and tri-tip deals.  Arriving are the interesting dishes (rabbit, duck, venison, etc.) with prices to match.  I haven't eaten dinner, but I have looked at the menu, and it looks like a very special spot... I will be going, and I will add to this review when I do.

I can't say enough good things about this place.  It is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.  I have driven up the coast from LA (about a 1 1/2 hour trip) just for lunch.  5 stars without any hesitation."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cool spot! Reminds me of a BBQ joint in rural North Carolina. In the wood. Cold cabin without heat. Good brisket. Cold beer. If you can survive the freezing cold venue (in the winter), you should check it out. Oh, you might have to wait in line, but if you're not in a hurry, no worries."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"One of the best road trip stops, bar none!

A great place to mingle with the locals and take in the great music and festive ambiance. Now let's get this straight, this is no high end fancy santa barbara bar, so if that's what you're looking for then you've best turn back. This is a nitty gritty, authentic, cabin bar in the middle of the woods; with a mixed crowd of bikers, campers, musicians, and local patrons. Overall this is a great watering hole to sit and enjoy the music, ambiance and grab a drink or two before heading on your way. 

When people say ""off the beaten path"" this is what they are talking about. It's like stepping back in time or maybe even side stepping to a more rural state because a place like this is rare in California.   

During holiday weekends, this place can get packed so be prepared to wait a bit for a beer. This place is more of an Oasis than anything else. A little slice of country in order to escape the monotony of city life. 

I would recommend checking the website to find the talented bands that frequent this establishment. For the most part the bands play on Fridays from 7-10pm, Saturdays 2-5pm & 6-9pm, and Sundays 1:15-4pm & 4:30-7:30pm. So if you're planning to head over, try to make one of those times so that you're able to get the full effect. 

The tavern might be a bit tricky to locate. It is off the 154 Hwy on Stagecoach Road, near lake cachuma.  

For those who are like me and need navigational coordinates, the GPS coordinates are 34""31.289'N  119""50.421W"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Mildly charming building; the food however is bad and overpriced.The baked artichokes were greasy and my pasta tasted of cardboard. The salad was nice but over dressed. Portions are very big, perhaps that's why it has good reviews."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Like everyone else, I'm going to rave about the tri tip sandwich. It is a plain looking sandwich, but it's amazing. They have 3 different sauces you can add and I put all 3 on. The one that looked like salsa was the best in my opinion. There were bikers everywhere, but it was totally relaxed and not sketch at all. We are going back tomorrow night for dinner."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cool little place off the beaten path. I stopped here for lunch after leaving one of my jobs, but didn't realize they stop serving lunch after 3pm. I was a little bummed out, it was only 3:30pm when I got there. But I drove out there so I stayed for a glass or wine, which all the wine on their list is local, I thought that was a nice touch. There are so many good wineries in the area. My server recommended a nice white wine, can't remember which one, but it was good. As I was sipping it and taking in all the oddities on the wall he asked if I would like a bowl of soup or some chili. I went with the chili! The wine and chili was an interesting combo!

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I love this place! Why? Because it's hidden and it's got loads of history with some really good fresh made dishes. Plus they have a bar! The restroom is outside in another building and that sucks especially when it's dark and you're alone. Kinda scary. I like they are open for short periods of time, makes you feel special when you eat. I've been here twice and look forward to more visits. They serve you fresh bread here too!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A really unique place that's up in the mountains about 30 min from S.B. the building does remind you of a time when it was on the stage coach trail, great charm. The Cold Spring Chicken was excellent."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"It has been a few years, and I was due. Man, this place has changed a LOT. But still the same in all the right ways. Now it's flooded with visitors and they have broken up services into different areas. Having a great meal in the fireplace room was just as charming though. The outside Sven looked perfect for a post ride beer and some onion rings. The venison sausage burger was great. Pulled pork decent. Expect a wait on weekends."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Very cool historic little restaurant (as they called it from the old days tavern).  Small room in an old building, you can envision yourself as a stagecoach driver from back in the day as you eat the barbecue meals at this little outpost.

A unique experience compared to the places you see these days.  Also, the food is surprisingly better than you'd expect it to be.

Great place for visitors and historic buffs to check out and wasn't crowded!"

That being said we go for the ambiance, the location and to show our friends a unique piece of Santa Ynez history 
Yes,the BBQ can be good but the food in the restaurant is always such a big disappointment 
It is overcooked and not at all worth the price or even worth eating
Why they don't make an effort is beyond us?
We really want to support this charming place 
The best is the bar the BBQ and the music , never miss that."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"BEST CHILI EVER!!!! If you like old west style restaurants then you must stop by. The drive is a little far because this place is in the middle of the mountains, the drive is worth it's, very scenic and enjoyable. The restaurant itself is very small, and you might have to wait depending on how much people they have. the place is so nice that we didn't mind waiting, we sat outside on  a bench enjoying nature. Going to this restaurant is an experience like no other."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Maybe I should have come here for lunch instead of dinner, judging by the reviews.

Boyfriend wanted to take me somewhere different and special.  This was certainly different!  I really liked the old-school style of the tavern and the woodsy/foresty location.

We ordered:
(+) The appetizer sampler (shrimp, pasta, venison stuffed mushrooms, artichoke hearts).  Random assortment, but I really liked it, especially the mushrooms and pasta (and I am NOT a pasta fan at all).

(-) The vegetable soup (which came with our entree): Whatever.  Tasted like it came out of a can.  Seriously could have skipped this or gone with a salad.

(+) The venison + garlic mashed potatoes: WOW. Mashed potatoes were to DIE for.  Boyfriend gave me the last bite which shows that he really loves me.  The sauce was incredible.  Venison was delicious and they gave just the right amount.

Here's where my complaints come in:

(-) The hostess/waitress (who eventually left) and the waiter (who eventually took over) would do really weird things like head over to our table, then look over their shoulder and start a conversation with someone else at another table or vice versa.  So it was really awkward.  For example, the waiter asked another patron if he would like to see the dessert menu, then before the patron answered, walked over to our table to attend to our needs, then returned to the first table and asked, ""I'm sorry, did you want to see the dessert menu?""

(-) I told the waiter my boyfriend and I were going to share the venison plate.  Since we used our original plates for the appetizer, I wanted fresh ones for the entree.  The waiter brought over just ONE plate, for me, which was PIPING HOT.  Like so hot that even after it had sat on the table for five minutes it was still warm to the touch.  He handed it to me without a word of warning ...so I burned myself.

Also, my boyfriend didn't really care, but it was odd to give us just one plate when clearly both of our plates were dirty from the appetizer.

(-) Okay I KNOW the drinks listed on the dessert menu are alcoholic.  But still, ""cider"" is a little ambiguous ...there is alcoholic cider and also non-alcoholic cider.  It could be helpful to note that the cider IS alcoholic.  I don't really drink so this was an unpleasant surprise.

(-) Food came out in between long periods of waiting ...waitstaff was nowhere to be seen except to serve the dishes.

Overall, food was decent (thanks to the heavenly garlic mashed potatoes) and service was lacking.  Maybe we'll come back for lunch sometime."

the bread and the meat were the first things i bit into. i also tore off a piece of the meat to taste. sometimes, just the meat is all you need to taste to determine how the rest of your bites will go. delish. the crusty bread with the juicy fatty meat left me speechless. but the apple horseradish and salsa were the real stars that really set this sandwich apart from any other sandwich i tried. DELISH. 

a definite must try."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"If you want a different dining experience then this is the place to go to.  The food is good but not the kind that would make you come back for.  Lots of bikers come here indeed. It's really hidden and if your not looking for it you will not find it.  Great landmark and historic.  

BBQ Beef sandwich was good I give it a 3 star wish there were a few more slices of meat though. 

New York steak cooked to order which was just the way we liked it. 

Their special of the day Shrimp linguine was the best out of all the dishes we ordered.  Full in flavor and jumbo shrimp. 4 stars."

Parking for your car and for your rear are often limited, but definitely doable. The rustic charm coupled with the 98% chance there'll be a good dose of sunlight dappling through the tree tops as you dine will convince you that this ought to be your new Sunday tradition."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This little hidey-hole practically reeks of authentic biker-bar/historic landmark charm.  Located off the 154 going up towards the Santa Ynez wine valley and nestled against a heavily-wooded side of the mountain, it's easy as piss to motor by without ever realizing the good eats to be gotten by taking a short scenic detour into Stagecoach Rd.  The BBQ sandwiches are deadly, as are the beer-batter coated onion rings.  Live music acts happen every now and then in the separate bar-room.  I'd give it 5 stars but for the fact that the service can be a little off once in awhile."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Incredibly charming atmosphere if you visit during the weekday. A loud biker scene on the weekends. Rich with local history, as it was once a stagecoach stop. However, the food is terrible. If you can't cook eggs...

CST is easily one of my favorite resturaunts of all time. In my top 5 for sure. 

If you are an angry vegetarian, you probably will not like this place, although there are pasta and vegeatable dishes. 

This place one time was a stopping post and just by looking at the picture, it is easy to see. You feel a sense of history just walking into the place. You also feel like you are in Frontier land in Disneyland. 

There are so many entree's to choose from. Even though you will pay a high price, it is beyond worth it. 

From Steaks, Ribs, Chops to Vennison, Chicken and Pork you will feel more than satisfied. 

Service is also excellent."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Before I hear from all you lovers of the tavern let me say that maybe I didn't love it here because it was an extremely busy holiday weekend, or maybe it was because I had a tick bury itself into my foot! 

Let me say, I'm not a camping or woodsy guy. I would much prefer a nice hotel with a five star dinner than being at a tavern in the middle of no where. With that, I do enjoy new things. 

New things here they come...we arrived around 11:30AM at the tavern on a holiday weekend and most of the shaded spots had been taken up. It was hot and I was ready for a beer. With beer in hand we decided we needed to try one of their famous tri-tip. 
Tip: You need to purchase the ticket at the bar to pick up the sandwich outside. 
So on to get the sandwich. While chatting with some friends in line I was interrupted by a stranger with a ""hey, you got a tick on your foot."" Not really knowing what to do, I played it cool and squeezed it out of my foot. After a bit of blood, I followed with a polite ""thank you."" I then went on with my chatting and drinking, all the while thinking....I had a tick in my foot...can't you get some sort of disease from that?...I'm glad he knew it was a tick because I had no idea....I really should know stuff like this...why didn't it hurt?...I've only had a sip of my beer so I still should feel it, right?...and why the hell am I here anyway? 

The debate and questions in my head raged on. I finally approached the tri-tip bbq area where I was greeted with a wall of smoke that had now blinded me, albeit a nice distraction from my tick situation. I got my sandwich which was basically meat and bread. They had some bbq sauce and a couple other condiments on the side, but without a plate and beer in hand it was hard to manage. 

We finally found a spot to sit and eat. The sandwich was good, not great. The band started playing some music and the day got a bit better. 

I probably won't return, but I have now educated myself on ticks and if I encounter one in a plush hotel in the future I will know just what to do."

One of our friends in the car mentioned that if we go out of our way a little we can have the greatest tritip sandwich. I'm so glad we exited and took the drive to this place.

Awesome friendly service and the greatest tritip sandwich.

I recommend just a little hot au jus along with a mixture of the special horse radish sauce & the bbq sauce."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A drive thought the hills a way but once you get there the vibe is amazing. On the weekend there was live music, drinking, lots of people but most importantly TRI-TIP sandwiches. Holy shit. These things are amazing. They grill and assemble them right outside. Grab a beer, find a picnic table and enjoy!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Coooooold Springs Tavern...weeehooo!! The drive up has insanely beautiful views.  Once you get there it doesn't even feel like you're in California anymore.  It's just little cabins in the middle of the woods.  Lots of flannel shirts and gray beards!  This is a no frills kind of place so if you want frills, get the heck outta hea!  If you want a no nonsense tri-tip sandwich (juicy slabs of meat slapped on a roll with either bbq or mustard) to go along with your large, cold beer ($10), enjoy a live band playing the blues and can do the stanky leg like no one's business, then grab some friends and come on!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Be advised: 

Friends and I had heard amazing things about their Sunday tri-tip cookout. We got there a bit early and they hadn't started cooking outside yet. We didn't know the drill so we walked into the restaurant and asked if we were at the right place for the Tri-tip. We were assured we were at the right place so we sat down, ordered, and as we waited started seeing troves of people lining up outside for the ""real tri-tip sandwiches."" I couldn't help but feel a little jipped. The food we had was decent and the setting is pretty great but I'm pretty sure the wait staff was happy to steer us to eat inside when everybody else was eating outside."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Cool hang out close to some awesome trails. The tri-tip sandwich is awesome --make sure to slather on the bbq sauce and salsa. They have music and cute boutiques with jewelry and accessories. Only drawbacks are that it does get packed and NO DOGS ON WEEKENDS!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"It's all about those tri-tip sandwiches, especially when you add their barbecue and horseradish with whole grain mustard sauces. 

The meat is so juicy and it comes in thick slices on a French roll (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ?select=tnnvZS4u8Bw5KD1wvCsTVQ#gLpZVlHKwa1YGOdOHW_JSA). Incredibly satisfying, and they're only available Saturday and Sunday. 

Pick up your tickets in the storybook, ivy-covered cabin, with animal heads on the walls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ?select=lNqGTkScbnCPArR2GEZShg#-wlmZ-b35UJ-GY-59NDxyw) and guns over the stone fireplace (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ?select=lNqGTkScbnCPArR2GEZShg#tnnvZS4u8Bw5KD1wvCsTVQ). Head around back and trade your ticket for a fistful of bread and meat. 

It doesn't seem like much as first, but it's easily the best steak sandwich I've ever had and just enough to feel satisfyingly full and yet not sick. The combination of horseradish sauce (which was flavorful and, thankfully, not particularly spicy) and barbecue sauce make it all the more irresistibly potent. 

This is now the sandwich against which all other tri-tip sandwiches shall be measured. 

Cold Spring Tavern's origin dates back to 1886 when it served as a stagecoach stop. With its small grouping of buildings of varying historic value, it's comparable to Arizona's Tortilla Flat, which was also a coach stop for changing horses and taking a rest or grabbing a meal.

They're supposedly noted for their more gamey meats like venison, elk, buffalo, pheasant, rabbit, and wild boar. In the past they've also served lion, kangaroo, and bear."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This was my first time here. Acutally never heard of this place. When my husband told me that this use to be a spot, he would enjoy coming to over 15yrs ago. I just had see this place. As it turns out its a bikers hangout. The service was good, very small cozy spot. The restrooms, were not attached to the resturant...that tickled me. Not sure if this place, would be on my must go back to list."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This is definitely one of the most unique  places to eat.  It is well worth the drive.  But the drive is something that must be considered because it is in the middle of  no where and there is a windy narrow road to get there.
Once there you feel like you are back 100 years .  Bring a camera because this is a place you want to remember  and share with others. But ......sorry to say there are a few  things that are not too good.  First thing is there is not much parking.  The windy road is very close to the restaurant which is kinda dangerous.
       I just had a small salad because it was warm that day and I was not very hungry it was good.  The rest of the party seemed pleased with there soup and quiche but the server never came by with more water.  This place is worth a visit"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Loved it - good, simple food and and pleasant staff.

We had their tri-tip sandwich, charbroiled tiger shrimp and one of the appetizers platter (pasta, artichokes, some other thing) - all very tasty.
The atmosphere is also pleasant, and so is the staff."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"came in after lunch and it was empty except for us and a bartender hiding under the bar washing something. smelled of well used oil lamps and fireplaces. alls we had was a ""Cold Spring"" coffee (w/ baileys and frangelico) and apple pie a la mode. It was good, though!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Be forewarned, the drive up to this restaurant is treacherous on a rainy day. Very windy roads, potential avalanches, etc. My lady friend and I shared the venison sausage stuffed mushrooms which were delicious. My friend had the pork chop and said it was overcooked and tough and gave up on it after a few bites. I had the elk which was delectable. It was my first time trying elk and it tasted like a mix between bison and beef, with a slightly gamey taste. Still was delicious. The chili that I had with it tasted like Hormel chili out of a can. We both enjoyed our garlic mash. The service was AVERAGE at best. Although the antique environment was quaint, the soot from the kerosene lamp or dead termites floating in my glass were not. You have to walk outside to use the restroom. I could see how if you came here and had different food you would have enjoyed it more.  If we had ordered different things (as the menu was pretty diverse), came for lunch, or had a server that was better, we could have had a better time at this restaurant. As it stands, the service and the hit and miss on the entrees and sides warrant my rating. Maybe try this place at lunchtime or when the server is in a better mood."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"On the way up to Los Olivos, we stopped here for lunch on that  Saturday. 
I've been here several times before; its been here since the late 1800s. 

We had a bowl of chili each, the Cold Spring Chili and the Wild Game Chili. Both good, especially with beers. The food here is good. 

This is a very old cabin/ restaurant with other cabins nearby. Its on the old road ( aka Stagecoach Rd.) before the154 was built. Drive the old road if your going north, there are some interesting sites, like the huge bridge. 

There is nothing like this place as close to LA. 

Five stars for the cabin, and for still being in business all these years."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We have passed this location many times, but either too early for lunch (on the way to SYV) or heading home.  We finally made it!! 

I had a French Dip sandwich, that also had a great horseradish and came with the traditional au jus.  Excellent fries as a side.  My wife had a great Cobb Salad. 

The location itself is fantastic.  Off the main 154 road, and tucked into the woods.  Fantastic place as well."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Amazing historical place. This is a must if you are in the area. Come by for a meal, a drink, or just a look around. It is a very interesting place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Yes yes - it was so cowboy classic and cute in there and the food was great especially the BBQ ribs and chilli!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Came out about 12:00 place wasn't too crowded Tri tip sand which was really good like go back next weekend good as well as the onion rings! Beer on tap in the bar area had the island blonde pretty good as well
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Classic spot - the fact that it was important in 1852 as a coach stop - just starts the visit off right.

The burgers are good
The fries are great
The service is fast
The drinks are cold
Don't think fine dining but think Americana and your super satisfied.

I'd love to buy this place and fix it up (not ruin it) - its so charming.
I went for lunch - Foley Pinot was only $45 on the list!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Springs Tavern has the best tritip sandwiches hands down! 
If you are a regular, tourist or just passing thru, I highly recommend going to Cold Springs on a Sunday for their tritip sandwiches and live music."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Well I have to say me and my friend were sad to find out that they only serve the world famous tri trip sand which on Sundays. So when we finally arrived there we had the down graded version which is the BBQ steak sandwich. It was ok, but not worth the trip."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Excellent food and amazingly unique atmosphere, but a bit pricey. I had the rabbit and the chili. Both were great and I was able to make 2 meals out of it. The actual building was beautiful and old and creaky, and very homey with several fireplaces crackling during dinner. Lovely little place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Driving and eating here is an experience I recommend to all in the Central Coast. It's built off of the highway and still retains that tavern feel it is appropriately named. Dinner here is great and boasts an intimate atmosphere. The service is top-notch and I felt like we were the only table in the whole place. 

Deserving of its own paragraph are the tri-tip sandwiches sold on the weekends. I will never again have a tri-tip as amazing as the one at Cold Spring Tavern. I've traveled extensively across the United States and nothing has come close yet."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,The Tri Tip is great.  The Fries are great.  The Onion Rings are better than great.  Service is pretty good too.  Good experience overall.  Definitely worth the drive.  I would go back.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The BEST place to visit and bring out of state visitors. There is no place like CST and the food in the restaurant is great. Then you mosey over to the Tavern and take in a fun musical group, duo or soloist and it's like going back in time. Great place."

Never heard of it . We'll lets tell you something, after going today , I'll never forget it. Dopeness!!!! We drove about 30 minutes into the hills of Santa Barbara, pass some awesome scenery and then.............cars on every side of the narrow highway .... Then the tavern appears. Let me tell you , i felt like I drove right into a hillbilly / hipster BBQ party. Motorcycles , trucks , rolls Royce . Errbody here for that meat . What  meat you ask?? The tri tip. They serve it only on Sunday . You have three boys chillin in the corner Cooking up some serious cuts . You walk up to the bar, grab a nice blonde ale and pay for your ticket . You then give this golden ticket to the boys at the grill. This tri tip sandwich is so freakin good. Piled high on toasted bollio bread, you the can put au jus , horseradish mayo , salsa or their BBQ on top. Bombness. So good I had to have two!!! Grab a bench , enjoy the ambiance and live music . I'll definitely be back to try the restaurant . Small, quaint , with a cool menu. This place is a MUST!!!!!im big on hidden gems ."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"5 Stars is because this is the perfect road trip stop. Traveling on the 154 going north well then stop by for a brew and a tri tip sandwich!

My girl and I stopped by for a quick lunch before wine tasting in Santa Ynez. We arrived at 1:30 on Sunday. It's an old rustic bar and restaurant with band playing outside. There were lots of people and the energy and environment were great. We got a beer and a ticket for the tri tip. Pick up the sandwich around the corner, dressed it with Salsa, BBQ sauce and a nice mustard sauce. Grabbed a place to sit on a shared table and ate. People at the table were very friendly and we had a great conversation. The owner of the place who actually lives in Ohio was there and came by the table to thank us for stopping by.

We were in and out an had a great time!!!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I would have given it 3 stars if my review was just for the service and food, but the setting is worth an at least one star if not two.

I travel to the Central Coast often and I've been here many times. It much more crowed now and the service has gone downhill from mediocre. But then, you don't go to Cold Springs for a fine dining experience. You come for the atmosphere, the music and the overall experience. Oh, yeah, they have a damn good tri-tip sandwich, too!

On weekends they fire up the Santa Maria style grill and throw on the tri-tip, so grab a brew and a sandwich ticket at the bar and go out and mingle. It's a diverse crowd from bikers (both kinds) to locals and tourists. Weekends can be a bit crazy, but just relax and make the best of it. On Sunday's the music starts after 1, so get there early, find a spot and enjoy yourself at this historic 1880's tavern in the trees."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Terrific place and very worthy of a detour off 101. You won't find a place in Santa Barbara quite as unique as this. I had the tri-tip sandwich with an Arnold Palmer. Both were amazing! Live music played outside the Tavern, and I would strongly recommend sitting outside on a warm afternoon. Would absolutely go again!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I should have listened to Michael G. and skipped this one as our Valentine's Day dinner.  My wife and I have heard from our friends that Cold Spring Tavern is a special place and very romantic.  I did a little research and found a great review from Michael G. that made me think I should continue my search for a romantic spot to take my wife for Valentine's Day.  I then heard from a couple more people that we should go there and I made the reservations.  We showed up and the place was just as quaint as everyone described from the outside.  We then walked inside to find the place didn't have many customers and had a strong odor of lamp oil.  Every table had lanterns lit which is a good touch, but they need to air the place out from the smell.  We then sat down at our table and read the menu.  It was not the menu I saw online.  They had pretty much the same food, but it went from a regular starting price of $17.50 for an entree to $40 as their starting price for Valentine's Day.  Even a pasta dish was $40!  I didn't see any reason for the price increase other than it's Valentine's Day and they include dessert.  They should have given some warning of the special Valentine's Day menu and pricing when I made the reservation and/or on their website.  We walked out.  We do plan to go again another time and hope to have a better impression."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is hands down one of the coolest places to stop at if you're traveling between Santa Barbara and Solvang off the 154...and like Corazon R. said...the Cold Spring Tavern most definitely makes the detour worth the drive!!

Not much has changed from the time the Tavern used to be a stagecoach stop back about 130 years ago...It was established in 1865 and still has it's original flooring, roof, etc.  Everything creeks, the draft comes up through the floor if you sit in the wrong place lol. So it used to be a stop for people on horses, etc. to rest at, get some grub and carry on their journey over the pass...today you'll find similarities in terms of people stopping for some comfort food but instead of horses and stagecoaches, there are now cars and PLENTY of Harley's and other bikes.  It's quite the popular motorcycle stop seeing as the road is so scenic through the pass...

The menu is diverse and odd...not your normal fare by any means! Lots of your standard burgers, salads and the like but you'll also find a heavy assortment of game.  Things like the ""Buffalo Burger,"" ""BBQ Venison Sausage burger,"" and their famous ""Wild Game Black Bean Chili!""  I highly recommend not leaving the Tavern before having their ""Cold Spring Chili""...it's a must.

My dad used to ride up here with my mom on the back of his motorcycle and he tells me that not a thing has changed since then compared to now...you just can't beat tradition!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Oh my goodness, oh my goodness oh my goodness! As soon as we opened our car doors the aromas of this place greeted us ever so kindly. We were drawn to the restaurant and were seated by smiling people! The menu is out of this world with rabbit, bison, venison and duck. As you sit in the 1800 stagecoach route cabin, you are taken back to the days of the carefree lifestyle and slower paced world. With superb service, delicious food and amazing ambience this place ranks as my new favorite restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The sky is ridiculous.  Full of stars like you have never seen in your life!

Wine selection great!  Service was great!

My son had a buffalo burger and mashed potatoes came with your choice of salad, soup or chili. 

I had the boar and it was excellent.  My husband had the strip steak and it was ok.

The ambiance is great. 

Overall we had a wonderful time!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The food here is very good.  The location is a little out of the way and hard to find.  I recommend finishing your meal before it gets dark so you can find the road home.  The tavern is very rustic and worth the trip just to see it.  The comfortable restaurant and excellent food inside are a stark contrast to the rustic setting.  I had pan fried salmon which I loved, my wife had roast chicken, also good.  My daughter and her friend had fettucini and a buffalo burger which they also liked.  The portions are large, so you should bring your appetite."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Hidden gem. 
Yummy trip tip sandwich for $10!! They had live music when I was there. Totally worth the beautiful,drive to get there.  The service was good even though it was very crowded when we went there. I loved the outdoor patio tucked away in the back next to the little house."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This story is almost unbelievable.  I went wine tasting with a group of girlfirends on a Sunday and everyone knows that Cold Springs is a great way to end a day in Santa Ynez Valley.  We got there about 3 O'Clock which is pretty much sundown in the little canyon that the tavern occupies.  We got the Tri-Tip and some local beer and sat down to watch the band play outside.  Weekend bikers were everywhere and the atmosphere was magical until, my friend got sick.  Not from the food, but from all the wine she had during the day.  She ran to the bathroom and it was locked so she had to puke in the bushes.  Everyone noticed, i think the band even stopped playing for a step and then resumed.  We decided to drive her home and the look of disappointment on my face must have been apparent because the nicest guy in the world sitting on the fence said to me ""If you want to stay I'll drive you home.""  It was like a scene from a Patrick Swayze film.  We stayed and talked and two months since that motorcycle ride home we are still together...but now i have a much cuter helmet."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This was a little known secret, until I yelped about it.  Cold Spring Tavern is a former stagecoach stop located in the mountains of Santa Barbara.  Their menu is amazing (albeit pricey), but make sure you make reservations.  Forget the menu though, the best time to go is on a nice and sunny Sunday afternoon.  After 1pm they start grilling up some tri-tip sandwiches, and they have either their local bluegrass act, Tom Ball and Kenny Sultan, or some local group playing.  Nothing like spending a nice Sunday afternoon amongst bikers and car enthusiasts alike, drinking beers and jamming to some bluegrass...all in a mountain forest."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I got the tri tip sandwich and my wife got the buffalo burger (I got bites).  This place is legit, since 1865?!?!?!

This place is fully suited for a casual BBQ atmosphere/Biker Bar. Came here last weekend for dinner with my fiancé. From the Yelp reviews and website searches I'd done, I thought quant and rustic. Seemed more run down and haunted. Wait staff in the restaurant could care less about the customers. The spot next door seemed like a good time though. We should've skipped the restaurant experience and grabbed a picnic table, a beer, some tri-tip, and listened to the live music!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The Cold Spring Tavern is a Santa Barbara institution. It was a stagecoach stop way back in the day, a place to rest your horses, get a hot meal and have a stiff drink. Surprisingly, they have never closed and have been able to thrive as a unique restaurant/tavern that has stayed true to its roots. 

The CST location is very cool. Coming from Santa Barbara, you drive northeast high up into the mountains, almost like you are driving into the clouds. Once you peak, you head back down the mountain into a shady oak grove that is next to a cold stream. Hence the name. 

The key to an enjoyable meal at the CST is simple. GO EARLY! Otherwise, you will inevitably wait in line with the rest of the masses that slept in. We went 10 minutes after opening, and it was the bomb. 

The service here is very welcoming. Our server knew we were debating menu choices, and offered some great suggestions. We started with the beer battered onion rings. They were served hot and they were cooked perfectly. Although they have breakfast options, we had ordered off the lunch menu. I had the veggie burger with fries that was filling and pretty damn good. Daughter had a grilled chicken sandwich that she liked a lot. Wife had a quiche with a salad. Not mind blowing food, but all things considered, they serve good food at fair prices.

Before you leave, be sure to wander and check out their grounds. You will find an old jail, a stream, and a mini museum. 

On another note, about a half mile down the road, you will find Santa Barbara's famous ""Cold Spring Canyon Suicide Bridge."" There have been close to 60 confirmed jumps that have led the recent installation of a controversial barrier along the bridge sides. Morbid, but an interesting part of Santa Barbara history that is unknown to most visitors. Now you know, so go check it out."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Venerable as a Byzantine icon.  This place is over 100 years old, drips with souvenir styled decor, and actually serves sturdy food and good drinks.  A nice serpentine slope down to it off of San Marcos Pass/Chumash Highway helps make the experience.  Especially good I think for lunch when you're starting your day up the coast.  The tables aren't especially comfy but they are not the point. The point is to be staring at some stuffed head while devouring a filthy rich quiche slice or something served chili style."

I waited and waited continued to eat bread, finally, 10 minutes later my husband asked him where was my dinner.  waiter went back, brought the fettuccini, which looked like it had sat under a heat lamp for 30 minutes.

Unbelievable tri tip sandwich for $10. Ridiculously good, like vegetarians be jealous good!
Decent list of beers on tap for $4.5 for 12oz or $8 for 24oz. Full bar if you want liquor.

We also got an order of onion rings and they were a good compliment to the sandwiches (though they came with fries).

Service: *

I own a restaurant so I am overly sympathetic and empathetic when I am not getting top notch service- maybe it was a slammed lunch and our server is worn out, whatever.  But when the offenses start piling up my empathy dries up.  That's what happened with my highly anticipated, partially disappointing visit to Cold Springs Tavern. 
    As an out of towner with a love of barbecue I was on a mission to try California-style barbecue.  I had only read about CA's tri-tip beef contribution to the food genre and I was stoked to learn about the secluded Cold Springs Tavern from a local gal pouring wine in a tasting room in Los Olivos.  So my wife and I made plans to eat a late lunch there the following day (yesterday, a Saturday).  
    We found it, parked and were seated in the back room at about 2:20, the last turn before the 3pm close of lunch service.  The room was quiet and tucked back but full of a group at a six top and two other couples at the only other two tops.  The room was right next to the server stand and the kitchen entrance. 
   A young lady took our drink orders (water and wine for my wife, a beer for me) after cleaning the floor of some dipping sauce that she spilled on the floor.  She brought my wife's wine and left, returning to bring something to the table where she had spilled the sauce.  That couple asked her to clean the sauce that was still on their table cloth and dripping down the side.  She probably didn't see it, no sweat.   A guy server took our food order after answering our questions and steering us toward what we wanted- awesome.  
    Our cup of wild game chili came out.  But my beer was nowhere to be seen- nor the water.  After a couple minutes and went out to find her and see what was up.  She said they're out of it.  Okay, would have been nice to know that.  She offered an alternative but I could get it at home so I walked to the bar to see my options- the bartender mentioned another CA beer that I didn't remember from the menu that I wanted so I got it and went back to my seat.  The chili was amazing. 
    A different guy server brought our sandwiches- the tri-tip in sauce and the tri tip option with sauce on the side as well as apple horseradish and salsa.  They were awesome.  I preferred the undressed option with sauces on the side.  I ended up not using much sauce and much preferred the salsa with some of the horseradish.  My side of potato salad was not with mine- forgotten by the kitchen or our server or both.  Good- I wanted to change to the regular chili.  Our girl server had been in the server stand area texting on her phone but she was not in sight- I saw the bartender and asked her, so she brought the chili.  It was also very good.
    My wife needed another glass of wine- and the water, it was a hot day.  Eventually my wife got up and tracked down our drink server and asked for another glass of wine and the water.  Things are starting to turn sour at this point.  The girl brings the wine and water, sets it down and walks off, no ""Here you go!"" or ""How is everything?""
    We wrap up, ask one of the guys at the server stand if we can get a to go box and our check.  The room is empty at this point.  It's quiet, no music, an unwelcome feeling from the drink server, and we are now talking not about how good the food is but how jacked up our service has been.  The fella who took our food order brings the box and the check, asks how everything was.  We said food was awesome but our girl server ""needs some work"".  He said the servers don't have sections and everyone kind of works all tables.  
    While we're boxing up the leftovers our drink server comes into the room to go through a closed door in the corner behind my wife's chair.  She kicks the leg of my wife's chair and again doesn't say a thing.  We are definitely getting bad energy from her now.  I leave a ~10% tip on the credit card slip and take it to the bar so I can explain the low tip.  The bartender is not around and our salty drink girl is behind the bar so I leave the slip on the bar and we leave. 
    I'm writing all this for two reasons. First, to defend my low tip.  My wife and I run two food service businesses, a lunch spot and a dinner restaurant.  The servers were undoubtedly talking about us and the low tip when we left and this is my only way of explaining to them what went down.  I am a 20%+ tipper- unless the train really goes off the tracks, which it did. 
    Second, hopefully management reads Yelp reviews.  I sure do.  Maybe the no section thing usually works but for us it didn't.  If our girl servers function is drinks, then she needs some training.  She smiled- initially- but her communication was non-existent (except for whoever she was texting with).  It was a downer of an experience and it colored my mood for the next few hours."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Very excellent tri-tip! That was the draw of this place. Never having been to Santa Barbara before, I did some research and this place pops up at the top of several lists online. I made a reservation for a Saturday night at 7:00 pm about a month ago through their website. I messed up on the date but they were very gracious about it and made the adjustment without any trouble. It is pretty out of the way so I was glad we were going before it got dark out-- the road would have been more difficult to navigate after dark. Doesn't seem like a reservation was really necessary and it wasn't too busy though there were a good number of people. We were seated inside. It's pretty dark on the inside and it's definitely a no frills kind of place, but I'm into it. Drinks selection is pretty basic (beer and wine, some cider)-- nothing special but that is consistent with the no frills thing. I was not too hungry and not sure I really wanted a sandwich for dinner, but boy am I glad I got the tri-tip sandwich. It was very well seasoned and tender. They cut thick pieces and put it on soft bread. They give you BBQ sauce, horseradish sauce, and tomato salsa on the side. I put the horseradish and salsa on it and it was very very tasty. Came with additional sides-- I chose the garlic mashed potatoes (other options are jasmine rice or baked potato). Mashed potatoes were very good and complemented the sandwich well. Also came with a salad to start with (you could also choose soup). The sandwich was huge and not being hungry, I only ate half and saved the rest though I was sorely tempted to eat it and risk stomach explosion. 
Staff was very nice and friendly. Not terribly attentive and at one point we had empty water glasses for a while. Not the worst thing in the world but I know some people are sticklers about their water at restaurants.
No parking lot so you just park by the side of the road. It wasn't too hard though and we were able to park not too far down the road. Bring a flashlight (or use your phone flashlight) if you plan to be there after dark so that you can find your way back to the car without falling down the side of the hill. After booking the reservation while planning this trip, I got two unsolicited recommendations for this place when I mentioned we were going to Santa Barbara. It's definitely very well known and the excellent reputation of the tri tip sandwich is well-deserved. 
Dinner for two with one round of drinks came out to about $66. Not too shabby."

Our son had said to stop at Cold Spring Tavern, just off Hwy 154.  Beautiful drive over & under Cold Spring Arch Bridge.  The tavern was a stagecoach stop and has been fairly well preserved though I'd heard some of it was destroyed in a fire.  The front area with picnic tables is dog friendly during the week (weekends they BBQ and dogs are not allowed).  Inside is pretty dark with a small bar and a big fireplace (lit though it was 80+°).  We sat out front since we had the dog with us.  Beer and a Venison Burger hit the spot!"

Everything was delicious. Very charming little hidden gem. We were walking towards the back admiring this place we asked one of the workers we found on the back if he could please take us a picture and he said"" NO I'm busy right now"" lol oh geez what a great first impression on our first visit!!! That's why I took a star off. The service not the greatest. It's not very welcoming. What a shame."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place was such a relief on this cold chilly day. The fireplaces were lit with warm embers and wood burning. I went here with about 15 of my biker friends and some of their gfs. Man the girls were so glad to warm their cold backsides..lol. I had an Irish coffee, and we ordered a variety of food. They have a full bar with a lot of beers on tap, barbeque going on in the back.

The food was great and the place was so nice and cosy. I wish it wasn't so cold and I must visit again on a sunny warm day. I highly recommend this place it's one of a kind."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cat Cora on Food Network was not messing around when she recommended this place.

It's an experience, that YOU need to experience.

The Whole Biker Bar atmosphere, the BBQ Smoke, the Loud Music... THE FOOD!

The Tri-Tip Sandwiches: Purchase your ticket in the bar, and go around the side for the most delicious food. You'll be suffering from watering mouth syndrome watching them slice the meat for your sandwich. Then, head to the station where there's sauces to add - no being skimped, you get to put on as much as YOU want.

This is something every person must go and eat!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This is where we went earlier tonight.  It's an old stagecoach inn and you step back in time when you go there.  It's not our NYE dinner but it was a good one!

Chill biker bar atmosphere. I'm Hindu, and I don't eat cows, except when I'm here. Their tri-tip steak sandwiches are boooooooooooooomb! There a bunch of home made sauces to top the sandwiches and it's freakin' delish! Order a beer and a tri tip sandwich and enjoy nature. HIGHLY recommend coming here."

The executive chef was very friendly and cooking fresh tri tip BBQ outside of the restaurant. 
We decide to go to dining restaurant not a bar area.  
I got tritip sandwich, my son got kids meal, my husband got BBQ sandwich with local telegraph large bottle beer. 
I liked cute little fire place with old style dining table and chairs. 
The food was very good and reasonable price. 
We will try to go to the bar next time."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I was here on a Tuesday afternoon, with a group of Porsche drivers on our way to Central Calif Coast.  The day was rainy and the fireplaces inside were welcome and made us feel very homey. No large groups other than us due to mid-week.  I had the beef dip sandwich, which is filled with tri-tip that was delicious.  I highly recommend in case you order it ask for the apple horseradish sauce on the side.  Our group of 15 all enjoyed the hospitality and the food."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A little off the beaten path but well worth the 20 minute drive.  We were early for our reservation so popped in for a drink at the bar to wait.  Charming interior, great staff, and generous pours.  

The restaurant was even better.  Ambience can't be beat.  Super rustic and very original.  No dress code.  The duck was incredible, as was the venison sausage.  The Jack Daniels pecan pie was the best pecan pie I've ever had.  I can wear shorts and sandals all while eating a 5 star meal.  Would absolutely recommend."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Not so hidden gem but amazing!!! Try the Tri tip sandwich and chili. You won't be disappointed. Atmosphere is pretty cool, like you've traveled back in time."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Rustic, quaint, good food...all qualities I like in a roadside joint, and this place did not disappoint.
Started out with the onion rings which were perfectly crispy without being greasy. Moved onto the ribs and while they weren't smoked they were tender and served with a spicy sweet bbq sauce. Beer selection is local as well as a bar for libations.

Ambiance is hunting cabin, prices are below expectation, and staff was friendly and helpful!

If we are in the area we will definitely stop back...this joint makes the list!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Interesting place to visit b/c it's on the road that seems like it goes to nowhere. The restaurant looks like it's from one of those Twilight Zone episodes where the people go in but never come back out. That's the ONLY thing on that road. So if you come to a point where you start wondering if there's anything, keep going. I guarantee you that it's there.

Creepy but a very interesting experience. All the furnitures there are all original (i.e. built in 1920's or something like that) and there's NO background music... which means unless you are engaged in a conversation with a person you brought, you pretty much have to talk to other people if you don't like absolute silence like me.

Food's pretty good. Kinda pricey but well worth it b/c the portions are huge and the taste is awesome."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Awesome location. Has a nice old american feel to it. The charbroiled chicken burger was delicious.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Go for the burgers. Sit outside and listen to the babbling brook. It's an out of the way little oasis that's always worth a stop.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A word of advice to newcomers would be to make a reservation. My party of 3 came on a Saturday night and waited 50 minutes as a walk in. The hostess/server told us 20. Unbeknownst to us, they were understaffed. 

That being said the food definitely made up for our wait. We ordered the bison burger, tri tip sandwich and rabbit loin. The quality of everything was exceptional. To end we had the apple cobbler which was just as tasty.

Tldr; make a reservation. Food makes up for long walk in wait"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Mmmmkay, what the f*ck. I went to UCSB, have been back multiple times, and now live downtown. How have I never heard of this place?? Centuries old buildings? Live music? Bikers, bbq, beer??? You need to come here!

Service & atmosphere: so we decided to eat inside the actual Cold Spring Tavern first and then sit outside for a beer afterwards. Inside is UNREAL. Since it was built in the 1800s, its the perfect building to look around at all the history, feel like Laura Ingalls Wilder, and wonder how the shit this building is still standing! It's cozy, warm, and so quaint! Service was quick, friendly, and attentive as well. 

Food: So my friend and I split chili cheese fries and ribs, since we were on a diet... The fries were yummy, coming from someone who doesn't even like chili! The ribs were juicy, fall-off-the-bone, and I could have easily eaten the half rack myself. 

Outside, there's a bunch of picnic tables where you can have their famous tri-tip, listen to music, and bring your drinks from the log cabin bar. People-watching is amazing since the crowd is veeeery different than your normal yuppie, White-linen, blonde SB crowd. Families, bikers, couples, and friends made up a much more diverse crowd, which was very refreshing. 

The place is so picturesque and the food was comforting and delicious. I'll be back with my parents, and any other visitors, in tow!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Arrived about 10:30 on a Sunday Morning and we were the only ones there for about a half an hour. The buttermilk biscuits might have been the best I've ever tasted ever! And the omelette was fantastic. 

The ambiance inside was so nice, it was a little cold that morning even sitting close to the roaring fire...but it's a lovely place. Reminded me of one of those hidden gems you'd find in Woodside or Big Sur, only with waaaay better food.

Started filling up around 11 and had a row of cars waiting to take my parking spot by the time we finished breakfast. Looks like it's pretty lively in the afternoon. Looking forward to coming back!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"My family and I stopped at Cold Spring Tavern on our way to vacation in Solvang. I imagined this was place was quite the Yelp discovery, but was left wanting more. 

The day we visited, it was pouring cats and dogs! However, I would say that it helped the rustic feel of the experience. The parking was simple - on the street wherever you can find room. Upon entering, my family and I were left sort of standing around waiting for someone to help us. The employees were going back and forth from the bar, but no one greeted us. Finally, we were sat in the front of the restaurant by the fireplace. 

Apparently, my family had just missed a huge rush of customers and they were understaffed. How do I know? The servers felt free to complain loudly about it every time they passed each other. Ultimately, the servers decided that enough was enough and decided to turn away customers earlier than their lunch's closing time of 3 PM. My family came in around 2:15 PM and they started turning customers away around 2:30 PM.  That was a bit unprofessional for my taste. I would have been very disappointed to make a special trip onto the mountain roads in the rain only to be turned away! Even the cook came out and questioned why he stopped receiving orders and laughed when they mentioned they were done for the day.

The food we received was decent, but I have definitely had better. Perhaps the storm affected their heating because both my soup and the hot water we asked for were cold. Our server did not come around besides delivering the food, so we did not get a chance to ask for them to be heated. The BBQ sandwich I ordered did hit the right spot so I can't complain there.

PROS:
Ambiance/Uniqueness
Location

CONS:
Food Quality/Temperature
Staff Quality
Deviation from posted closing times

Overall, I think Cold Spring Tavern is worth visiting for the ambiance alone. The tavern will give you a nice break from reality, but the food may leave you wanting more. Hopefully, Cold Spring Tavern's staff can work on their demeanors to create a better experience for future customers."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"If you've been to Santa Barbara and never driven up the hill to Cold Springs Tavern, you are truly missing out. The food is great--particularly the tri tip sandwich with Santa Maria pico de gallo. But the atmosphere and rich history is unmatched anywhere I've eaten in Southern California. That statement might seem bold-- but I literally can't think of another place quite like this place in terms of atmosphere. Loved this place and thoroughly enjoyed the food!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Welcome back to an era long since put to rest... but thanks for this place for keeping the history alive. YES, as much as possible they've left it as is, from back in the Stagecoach era. I would assume the food is very similar, as they use Wild Game in some of their dishes. 

I've been here twice to eat, and both times were remember-able and the service was excellent. Get ready for Homemade everything, from bread to the hospitality. 

For all of the above and a sense of comfort.... I give this place one of few 5 stars I've given

will be back for sure!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The tri-tip sandwich and onion rings are excellent, but the history and atmosphere are unbeatable. It's hard to imagine, but folks traveling through the mountains on stagecoach stopped here to eat just like those of use using two or four rubber tires do so now. The food, service, and atmosphere are well worth the extra effort it takes to come here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Excellent sandwiches and excellent food. Great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and just kick back and relax..
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"High hopes, but just an okay dinner experience.  The wait staff was young/junior and not really prepared for dinner service.  The service definitely detracted from the experience.

Dinner was pretty good but not great.  Boar chops were tasty and I would get them again. A bit overcooked (requested medium rare).  Buffalo burger was good, but why not offer beef burgers at dinner if you are known for your burgers?  You can charge more and offer a salad to make it a dinner burger.  The vegetable ravioli was the real winner.  Excellent.

1 star service (had to ask for refills, waiter did not know the menu, waiter never returned, had to track down my own bill and pay at the wait station)

The picture here speaks for itself. It's just an old cabin ""style"" restaurant, very quaint. Fireplaces throughout, trophied animal heads on the walls. This place is not for vegetarians. Steaks, rabbit, pork, duck, venison, and chicken are all featured on the menu. The mashed potatoes were excellent as were the venison sausage stuffed mushrooms.

There is a ""tavern"" next door to the restaurant, locals and bikers were throwing down beers as they listened to local musicians sing the blues on their harmonica and guitar.

You really feel like you are deep in the woods, a great spot to include on your weekend of wine tasting."

We stopped by Cold Spring Tavern for my birthday. It is a quaint little place on the side of the road. It had lots of historic elements and great signs to keep you informed. 

There was a cute little bar with live music. We waited here while we waited for a table at the restaurant. We didn't have a reservation but we didn't have to wait too long. 

Their food was delish! We had the burger, steak, and chicken. There was nothing on the menu that disappointed us. 

I love how unique the setting is. It really feels like you are in a storybook. I would highly recommend this place to bring family and share a unique meal!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Growing up in Santa Barbara we knew about and visited this unique restaurant many times. Now that we live farther away it's more difficult to get there but it's still our goal to visit when we can. My wife and I had lunch this afternoon. The food was outstanding: BBQ beef sandwich with potato salad, and BBQ chicken sandwich with fries. Both were outstanding but the beef took the prize. We had to ask twice for my wife's Diet Coke to arrive but that's a minor point. What bothered us throughout the meal was the constant thump thump thump of the bass coming from the kitchen. It's like when you're at a red light and the car next to you has some loud music playing (windows up) and all you can hear is the bass. Our waiter had someone turn it down but we could still hear it. As I explained to our waiter, when we drove all the way up the hill from Santa Barbara for lunch in such a rustic and beautiful area, that kind of annoying bass was what we were trying to get away from. It bothers me that they didn't put the customer first today so I can only give 3 stars."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"""Where in the world are you taking me?"" 

My words as we're driving through the twists and turns of the mountain to get to this biker stop/bar that serves quite possibly the best tri tip sandwich I've ever had.

No frills, just quality tender and flavorful tri tip meat on a soft chewy roll.
Some au jus on the side if you want. Or maybe it's the subtle kick of the horseradish sauce you desire. Whatever condiment, it only enhances the taste experience. Must eat for sure.

You ask yourself, can it get better? Why yes it does. 
The onion rings are superb.  The batter is crispy, crunchy, light... everything that makes an onion ring perfect.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Precioso restaurante en medio de una montaña en Santa Bárbara. Para llegar es necesario tener coche, que se puede dejar aparcado en las inmediaciones.

El sitio es una antigua estación de postas. Así, el restaurante está en una cabaña muy bonita y con una decoración rústica, rodeado de vegetación y del resto de elementos de la estación (incluso una pequeña cárcel donde se encerraba a los presos que se transportaban mientras se cambiaban los caballos de los coches). 

Es un poco caro, y la comida está buena, aunque mi hamburguesa BBQ estaba demasiado picante para mi gusto. El servicio es atento, aunque no tanto como en otros sitios de EEUU (donde están todo el rato pendientes de ti), tuvimos que esperar un rato para que nos sirvieran o para que nos rellenaran las jarras de agua. Y, eso sí, se suele llenar bastante de gente.

En fin, lo mejor del restaurante, sin duda, es el sitio en el que está, que merece la pena visitar antes de seguir por la ruta de la costa."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"You won't find a more charming, cozy, rustic place to enjoy a tasty breakfast, lunch or dinner. Cold Spring Tavern has apparently been at the same location since Lincoln was president. At first glance, it almost seems unreal -- a storybook cabin nestled in the woods with fireplace smoke wafting from the chimneys and mingling with the branches of the tall, old trees that surround it. But, it is real, and only a 25 minute drive from downtown Santa Barbara!

The menu is also rustic and basic, with a few things you won't find on just any menu -- like venison, rabbit, and buffalo. The food is good, not great. Very reasonably priced. The fare will satisfy your hunger, but the real reason to go to Cold Spring Tavern is for the sense of history and charm of the place itself.

One note of warning: If you want to enjoy a quiet time, you'll want to avoid going there on a Sunday afternoon. Apparently, it's some kind of tradition for motorcycle groups to meet up for the tri tip special and live music. I was unaware of the Sunday happenings, and I was shocked when I saw the Tavern swarmed with hundreds of bikers. It looked like a crowded amusement park, which isn't what I'm looking for when I go to Cold Spring Tavern.

Highly recommended. A ""must see"" for anyone visiting Santa Barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I haven't reviewed a Place in a long time but I'm so upset by the way my service was I thought I should take the time to write it up. 

I used to LOVE this place great tri-tip, chili beans are ridiculous, onion rings are delicious. I was really looking forward to taking my man there. We drove three hours just to feast on the sandwiches.  

I was aware the kitchen closes at three but due to traffic we got there at 230, Later then i wanted but Just in time to order our food. The waitress unsure of her name but blonde girl, kinda thick with tattoos tells us kitchen closes in 30 mins. Ok still time. So we order our food and set up at table inside. It's obvious we r preparing to stay inside, we have a baby and all this baby stuff set up. 

There are people still inside and another couple comes in after us and sits down to order food as well. 

anyways food comes out fairly quickly. Waitress literally puts on table and walks away. my hamburger has fries and we had onion rings. So um excuse me can I get ketchup. I swear you would have thought I asked her to move a mountain. But she grabs it from another table next to us and gives it to me. 

Also asked for my hamburger and chili beans no cheese. She brings me chili beans with cheese and disappears. I wait at counter with my container of chili beans and tell her I ordered my chili beans with no cheese. She tells me ""nobody told me"" are u kidding me. Ur the waitress who else would I tell? 

When she reappears with new chili beans minus cheese I ask her if I can bother her for some eating utensils. She points to a container holding plastic silverware and says ""yeah, it's over there, I thought you guys were eating outside but she goes to get us some plastic spoons and napkins Mind u the table next to us just got their food and is eating with real utensils. 

I really hope this girl was just having a bad day but it just totally ruined our experience. And it doesn't matter how good the food is nobody wants to be treated badly."

He made a really great Long Island Iced Tea for my date and suggested the Melville Pinot Noir for me (really yummy!). I had the Appetizer Platter that included Artichoke Hearts (not normally something that I enjoy but the flavor and texture was perfect), Venison Sausage stuffed Mushrooms (my favorite!), and Tiger Shrimp with linguine in a cream sauce (the shrimp had an awesome smoky flavor, I loved it). My date ordered the NY strip with garlic mashed potatoes; me being a Texas native I was VERY impressed with the steak's flavor. Overall I must say BRAVO and I will return and/or suggest this place to anyone who wants a great meal. Oh and the side salad was phenomenal...I am a ranch dressing fanatic and it was the perfect consistency, the greens were crunchy and fresh; a perfect start to this great dinner. Thank you to Paxton and all the chefs in the back for making our meal so great."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My husband and I visited Cold Spring Tavern this past weekend with our Family of 7 and I was 'over the top' impressed with the food here!  The service was equally impressive AND very accommodating! For a Saturday afternoon it was very crowded inside and out but they didn't take long at all to sit us (party of 7) The people there were very friendly as well, as we were offered a table outside as another group was leaving.  I ordered their charbroiled chicken breast sandwich for lunch and it was absolutely delicious!  The roll it was served on was warm and lightly toasted, the chicken was done to perfection, and the lettuce and tomato were fresh. It doesn't get any better!  They served us some of their delicious onion rings as an appetizer with some ranch dressing and they were hot and delicious!  I would love to stay for dinner some time! The atmosphere here is 'Old West' if you read the history on this place-- This is an old Tavern that dates back to 1868 as a rest stop for travelers on horseback to rest and change teams of horses.  It is a very small place but there is seating outside with a beautiful backdrop of trees and a natural water river that is what makes it so comfortable and cozy.    I WILL be visiting this place again! I would be there most every night if I lived closer!  I can honestly say, if you have not been here it is worth the time and you won't be disappointed!   Thank you Cold Spring Tavern! I will be back as soon as I can"

We ate at the restaurant, sit down one - not the tri tip sandwiches.  The atmosphere is like stepping back in time, has some magic to it, and the food was delicious!  This is a new pit stop for sure."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold springs tavern an old stage coach stop 15 minutes outside Santa Barbara 
Had the chili fries to start chili was one of the best fries were cooked perfect and they came piping hot
My partner had the. Edgier burger he said it was to die for...
I had the bbq ribs the fell off the bones, and the famous sauce yes is just as great as they say
We both had the potato salad nothing special ok could use a little kick or more mayo
We arrived on a Monday around 11:30 right before the rush 
Service was super total team work the wait staff work together never a time are drinks were not full, food came fast and hot
If you want a real home cooked meal in an old setting stop out at Cold Springs Tavern come early or mahe. Reservations"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern is all about the experience. It's an old stagecoach stop tucked away in the mountains above Santa Barbara. They have live music on the weekends and a guy who makes super good BBQ tri-tip sandwiches outside.

It's an interesting mix of Harley-Davidson guys and folks in Ferraris and old pick-ups. The restaurant is fairly pricey, but the food is good.

Really it's more about bloody maries, beers, live music, and the tri-tips on a weekend afternoon."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great food and atmosphere. Did not get chance to see the other building but sounded very interesting. Hope to get back.

Probably the best steak I've had in years. The service was excellent."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Such a cool spot! 

While technically secluded in the Santa Barbara mountains, this highly trafficked eatery is a go to for all types of travelers. The location is absolutely beautiful. There's an authentic charm in the rustic decor that you don't find much anymore. The tavern consists of both an outdoor bar/eatery where you can grab drinks and sandwiches on the go, as well as a smaller indoor space (that takes reservations). 

If you're expecting a super exhaustive menu, you'll be disappointed. There's a decent selection, but you really want to stick to the classics here. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich is Ah-Mazing! It's a flavorful, and messy experience - as it should be. 

The tri-tip sandwich is excellent too, though it's a bit more deconstructed - so you'll have to add your own sauces that they provide. 

Don't be afraid to add some chili to your meal. We got the sampler, but their classic chili is by far the best. Get it on fries or in bowl - JUST GET IT!!

Overall had a great experience here and would recommend it to anyone traveling nearby!

Stay Cheerful ;)"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This was a great little surprise to come upon on our Cali road trip.
Amazing Tri Tip sandwich with very tasty options to put on top, the salsa wouldn't have been my first choice, but TRY IT! You'll be delighted with the freshness! 
Wonderful potato salad and good beer options, too!
The setting is what really gives me the best impression, I felt like trolls built and ran the place!
I wish this place was closer to Wisconsin, I'd love it to be my rehearsal dinner spot!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Where have you been all my life?!?! The seclusion and vibe of this place deserves 5 stars in itself. Lots of bikers, mixed with luxury cars and college students, anyone and everyone is welcome, however leave the dogs at home or in the car. There is a sign before you reach the place, but I guess a lot of people don't read it.  Do yourself a favor if you don't want to get yelled at by one of the bikers.

Now to the real part, those tri-tip sandwiches are to die for!. My boyfriend ate 2 of them. It is well worth the drive through the Mountain and middle of nowhere to try these. They stick almost half of a tri-tip on one sandwich. I did not try the sauces so I can not comment on that, but I would definitely recommend pouring the Aus Jus sauce they have at the sandwich stand over your sandwich, it was all my boyfriend and I needed for it, he ate 2 sandiwches and got one to go.  I promise you won't be disappointed.

FYI, you have to go inside the bar to pick up your sandwich ticket for $9.25, they have fresh spring water in there as well. You then pick up your sandwich at the tent inbetween the bar and restaurant. Make sure you bundle up, its cold up there, and you will most likely be sitting outside unless you're lucky enough to find a table inside the bar where its warm and cozy.

Also, I think they only have the sandwiches on the weekends and Sundays are the best days to go."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Hidden gem in Santa Barbara. Pretty cool spot, reminds me a lot of the diners in South Dakota during sturgis when all the bikers arrive. Nevertheless, the tri-tip sandwiches are amazing. Definitely worth the detour, and make sure to grab a beer (if you're not the designated driver)."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a pleasant surprise.  The food is why you come and why you will return.  Venison sandwich and chili trio so good.  Wish we had had room for the homemade desserts.  Next time for sure.  Pleasant surroundings and not crowded on the weekend.  Interior a little dark and cluttered, but the food more than makes up for it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"what a random place for a restaurant!  the location worked out perfectly for us because it's on the way to the wineries if you want to take the more scenic route. (yes, more scenic than the 101).  you get to see the mountain side of santa barbara and it was BEAUTIFUL!!

i really didn't know what to expect when i booked the reservation for our party of 9... the website isn't exactly appealing and the location isn't close to anything.. but i had a feeling that the food would be worth the trip.. and i have to say i had a pretty good time.

you definitely should make a reservation if you plan on going on a weekend.  the menu wasn't very extensive but there's enough items on the menu to please everyone.  while most of us ordered either the bbq trip tip sandwich or the french dip, i also tried the buffalo burger and the chili cheese fries.  all of the dishes were tasty w/o being overwhelmingly heavy.  

the place itself, like many others have mentioned, is quite a sight to visit.  we took lots of pictures with the cabins, the ""jail"" house, and the drive itself is worth the trip because the view and the scenary is just gorgeous.

the only thing that may be cool or totally uncool for you is the decoration inside the restaurant was a bit.. well, much.  i was ok but i'm sure my buddhist vegetarian mother would have screamed at the sight of all the deer heads hanging on the wall...

if you're planning a trip to santa barbara, and you're going to the santa ynez wineries, you should definitely stop by here for a tasty treat."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"If you're the intrepid type, this family and biker spot is far from anything insipid. It's anagolous to Cheers where everybody knows your name but much cooler because it welcomes passerbys. How did I find this spot off-the-beaten path? When you have a conconction of a former SB local and a few other friends all going out of their way after a long drive back from the Central Coast, I'm thinking this place has to be swag and my handy sidekick of a tummy is already prepping an after-dinner marinade. 

It's a no frills and humbling kind of place. You go in, order your beer and tri-tip (only served on Sundays) and the inviting middle-aged woman hands me a ticket to pick up my food from their outdoor BBQ pit. The cook is a Polynesian big, a little serious, but the kind you show respect to. After you get your grub, you stop by the sauce table, and find yourself an open seat at a picnic table nearby and listen to some live blues. If you're the pretentious foodie or the obnoxious type (meaning just plain disrespectfully stupid), I can't see that going well with all the biker dudes. It's their territory. 

I was pleased the tri-tip was cooked medium rather than well-done; it was extremely tender and flavorful. The french sandwich bread it was served on was lightly toasted giving it that hot sandwich feel. Overall, really great meat and the kind I'm going to have cravings over."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Cold Springs is awesome. You have to make sure to go if you are just visiting. :)  The best atmosphere around in a gorgeous setting. I actually had my wedding party dinner after getting married here. They were super accommodating.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"The historical setting is cute and worth a visit. The service was efficient. However, the food, which is ultimately the reason why we came here was mediocre. The sauces from the salad dressing to the sauces in the main dishes tasted packaged and not fresh. We will not be returning or recommending this place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a classic find. Tucked way down in an idyllic canyon off the San Marcos pass is a great stop after wine tasting in Santa Barbara. The rustic atmosphere combined with the weekend warrior bikers was great. There was a great bluegrass band playing outside to the delight of all the beer drinkers enjoying juicy tri tip sandwiches. Inside we were delighted to find a very well priced local wine menu, and awesome wild game choices with great crispy fries and onion rings. I had the chili trio. And lapped up every bit. My friend had the buffalo burger which was delicious. The service was great even though it was busy!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Recently went here on a Sunday (of Memorial Day weekend).  This place had been recommended by a friend as  an ""awesome experience"".  If you're looking for someplace unique, quaint, woodsy, etc. this is the place to go.  We had a 7:15pm reservation (Note:  they generally stop seating at 8pm or shortly thereafter).  The adjoining log cabin bar was packed and lively when we arrived but shut down at 7:30pm.  The restaurant is in an old cabin and has maybe 10-12 tables.  We had the ribs and the peppercorn steak, as well as the chili....all of the food was delicious.  The staff was generally friendly although you could tell it was starting to get close to closing time as they started to tend to their closing chores.  For a truly different experience I'd highly recommend it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I've been going to the Cold Springs Tavern since 1995 and it never fails to impress me.  The food & drink are fantastic.  The atmosphere is pretty cool, and it's just a fun place to hang out at, especially if you love to ride a motorcycle like I do.  

The extremely rustic and authentic facility is a page right out of the old west, with a mock jail, small rough hewn shacks and an outdoor BBQ that rates about an 8 on a scale of 1-10.  For those who want a souvenir, they sell keepsakes there too.

On another note are the great bands they get here.  The entertainment never disappoints...

So with all the praise, why do I only rate it four stars?  That has to do with the weekend crowds and parking, which is about as bad as it gets.  The parking ""lot"", if you can call it that, is an uneven patch of dirt under the trees just up the hill from the place.  Parking a bike here can be a real pain and I've witnessed many great men drop their bikes in the dirt, followed by a few colorful metaphors.  The very few designated spaces right in front fill up very quickly and are almost never available.  You can park on the narrow, winding, 2-lane road, but that's like rolling some expensive dice, especially with the way boy-racers drive through here.

It would be really, really cool if the management would find a way to pave the dirt lot and make a few motorcycle-only spots in front for their loyal customers.  Just sayin'..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Such a cool hangout!  Loved this place! Make sure you go on Sunday for full experience!  Awesome acoustic blues outside with Kenny Sultan and Tom Ball!  Excellent local Tri-Tip sandwich grilled fresh outside.  Wife ate a chicken sandwich from the restaurant and she loved it even though she is not normally a fan of bbq sauce!  We will definitely do this again in the future!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I made reservations for my parents' anniversary. They knew it was not a fancy place, but they were still a little surprised at how rustic it was. According to my parents, it was a unique experience enhanced by superb food. The wait staff was a little on the unrefined side, but both my parents felt that her energy and attitude were very positive. The drinks from the bar were very heavy pours, but that can be good for some! My mother still can't stop talking about the cod she had for dinner. They gave my parents a table right next to the fireplace which, being surrounded by animal skins and heads, made the experience at least a little romantic :P At first they had a hard time finding the place as it is off the beaten path, and then when they arrived it was so dark (night time plus rain) they almost thought they were at the wrong place! Totally would recommend if you are looking for a unique dining experience in a very rustic and woodsy atmosphere.

Just FYI - The email address on their website is incorrect last I checked (about a week ago) so if you don't get an answer after emailing I'd suggest calling. They were very pleasant to deal with both over the phone and by email"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is off the beaten path, but has very tasty food and drink, as well as a few out buildings you can visit and a small amount of history about before the bridge was built. Their tri-tip sandwiches were on the Food Network and are very good, I believe they're only served on the weekend. They also serve game; rabbit, venison, etc which is hard to find in this area. Also, cold beer!"

We had the Tri-Tip sandwich, onion rings and chili fries. The tri-tip was too salty. Service was fast but we did go at 11:30 am on a Thursday because it does get very crowded maybe it's the ambiance because I don't think it's the food."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Discovered this place quite by accident yesterday while out on a day trip adventure with a friend. So happy to have found it. This is so, ""my kind of place."" A woman walking out suggested we try the burgers so we did. Really terrific. Will be back for sure. What a sweet little piece of history nestled in the woods, still there for us to enjoy thanks to caring owners."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Nestled amongst the trees in a remote stretch of road off State Route 154 lies a place so rustic you would swear it is a movie set, but it is the real deal. This restaurant is run from what was actually a stagecoach waypoint over 100 years ago for travelers climbing the treacherous route to Santa Barbara through the mountains. The old jail and house where Chinese laborers lived are also preserved for posterity.

But make no mistake - this is no tourist trap that banks on its location and skimps on the food. The cuisine and ambiance are excellent. My wife and I went there for lunch and found the menu surprisingly large and quite reasonable for such a popular, remote place. The Italian Tomato soup was as addictive as any controlled substance, and my wife will no doubt be trying to re-create it in our kitchen for many weeks to come (with a little help from the busboy who actually created the recipe). Burgers are a generous half-pound, the meat is fresh, and the chili is wonderful. Even the french fries caused a spirited discussion over what the secret seasonings could be.  We will definitely be back for dinner someday to explore further.

This place is very much worth the drive out of Santa Barbara, again and again."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"On another recommendation of my aunt & uncloe's neighbor, a Lompoke & Santa Maria transplant, strongly recommended this & the drive we took was breathtaking along witha lake that is well known in the area.  It is an old stage coach nessled in a wooded quieter part of Santa Barbra.  The atmosphere is so down home & service friendly.  Everything on the menu sounded wonderful; I could not make up my mind; so, when our waiter said they are known for tritip, tritip it was.  Soo tender & perfectly marinaded & seasoned on a toasted bun; perfect for dipping into the sweet, tangy, & smokey bbq sauce as well as the hourse raddish that had a kick that was not extreemly strong but enough to liven things up.  The salsa with it would have gone better with some soup or chips or what jhave you.  The green salad was fresh with vegetables in a very chunky savery blue cheese dressing; mmmmmm.  Their bread that you get with some entrees is made with garlic, arigino, & other spices; a very lively feast for the tastebuds.  Their restrooms are located slightly across the lot from the restaurant & are clean & have old fashioned doors inside.  Just slightly down from that is the tavern which was closed; I definitely want to check it out next time.  I love the smell of cloves throughout the dining room along with all the woodwork.  They did a great job preserving this old stage coach.  So, for some downhome American comfort food at reasonable prices with friendly service in an oldworld atmosphere, Cold Spring Tavern cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Nothing you don't already know... this place is goooood.

Saw it advertised on the food network as a must do in SB, I absolutely agree with their assessment of this establishment.  We had the BBQ'd Tri-tip sandwich and a side of chili cheese fries!  The Chili is really really flavorful and if i wasn't so hungover i would have had seconds.  The Tri-tip is good and smothered in flavor packed BBQ sauce.

Better than the food... The people! They were incredible nice and the whole place had a great atmosphere from the 1800's.

Enjoy"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Found this place on Yelp as I was looking for a restaurant that was a bit off the beaten path and an adventure - BINGO!  It was all as was expected based on most Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed.  The drive was short from our beach front condo near East beach, and very scenic as well.  I loved the rustic buildings and all the history associated with the them.  The first building hosts a full bar where we were told hosted a band on weekend afternoons.  I was surprised at how many customers just come there to get a drink  to enjoy outside on the wooden tables.  You can also order food at the bar to enjoy outside.

We were seated promptly even thought we showed up around 12:30p on a Saturday with a party 5.  Service was prompt and food was as described - very delicious.  I had the BBQ Tri-tip sandwich - yum!  Bonus - they do have a kids menu!

There was a steady flow of customers that continued to stream in while we dined and a crowd was starting to form near the bar as a band was arriving and setting up for the late afternoon festivities.

Seriously a great little find, we will come again - Loved It!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Started at the bar while they set up the table at the restaurant. 

Sure, we could have waited around, but we would have missed out on the live country music, dancing, stiff drinks and the smell of amazing homemade chili (behind the bar). 

I ordered the baby-back ribs per the recommendation of the waiter and I was very impressed. Also had a bit of the duck which was equally good. 

Great service and great appetizers (got the platter/sampler). Definitely bring your appetite though. they don't skimp on the portions. 

Looking forward to coming back soon."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Was recommended this place by my boyfriends parents. It is such a cute little spot in the mountains. If you are thinking of coming here don't think twice about it JUST DO IT! It's worth it. We got the tri-tip sandwich & chili cheese fries & both were delicious! Couldn't help but say mhhhm everytime I had a bite. Our drink of choice was the 805 beer & hoppy poppy. We had a great time.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Make the decision to go and GO! You will not be disappointed. The drive up was like something out of a movie with trees blanketing your way to the tavern. The sun doesn't hit the valley so take a jacket. There was a lot of people there drinking and having a good time so we were a bit worried that the wait was going to be long but our name was called in 3 minutes! The interior was like we stepped of a time machine in the 1800's. 

Ok now for the food, I got what has to be, the BEST tri-tip sandwich I have ever had. You can order one outside and eat on the tables out there but we wanted to sit in the old stagecoach quarters so we waited to be sat and ate in the warm old building. My husband got the chard-boiled venison sandwich. It was the most tender meat. Both our sandwiches are a must have. We ordered onion rings as an appetizer and glad we did. The coleslaw is fantastic! It's different than the average coleslaw. I wanted to buy a bucket to take home. Oh and I can't leave out the white horseradish sauce,  

Overall, I would not pass up the opportunity to stop and eat at a place of history."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Holy cow I love this place. I remember having found it a decade ago and that it was an amazing Tri-Tip Sandwich lunch. I was crossing fingers that it was still how I remembered it and sure enough, it was actually better. It's a biker spot at heart with hundreds of bikes parked outside. It looks like a run down coyboy bar from the movies except everyone is in a great mood. Most of that reason is (ok maybe some of the alcohol) but mainly the incredible tri tip sandwich. It's fresh, it's moist, it's tender and it's flavorful. It's the perfect size and for only $10. I am definitely in my happy place when I'm here. A must on the way to Solvang/Los Olivos or on the way back to finish up a trip."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Went here with my husband for my bday and it was AWESOME!  Absolutely beautiful setting.  The restaurant consists of different rooms with very interesting and old decor.  We went for an early dinner and just called the restaurant on our way there for a quickie reservation.  I had the wild boar chops and they were SOOO GOOD!  Hubby had the filet mignon and it was also great.  Both our entrees came with a tasty salad or soup.  Our bill was 109.00 - pretty good for 2 entrees and a bottle of wine.  If you like to try interesting food or wild game, this is your place.  I saw a grill outside the restaurant and they were serving up tri-tip sandwiches.  There's also a bar next door with live music and places to sit outside.  Very cool scene - seems to be popular with the bikers.  Now the negatives: Unfortunately it was a very hot day and it was way too warm inside the restaurant.  I guess being that its old and all, they dont want to put any AC in there.  Also, the service wasnt as attentive as I would have liked.  Because of the great food, the interesting history of the place, and the overall scenery inside and out, I STILL have to give this place 5 stars.  A true hidden gem and very romantic.  SO glad we made the trek up there!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Agreed, this is a cool place to stop on your way to Santa Ynez Wine Country.   It is a very beautiful drive and then you come upon the Tavern, you get out of the car and walk down the road back to the building.   You can tell very quickly that those that are there like to drive and go off the main road to find the really cool places.   The food was good, I had a salad and a taste of the Buffalo Burger.  The beauty of Cold Spring Tavern is its location and the drive there."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is a true experience. Nestled in the woods, you feel a million miles away from the city. Very fun and relaxed vibes. We did not want to leave! 

I was disappointed, however, that the dinner menu did not have a single vegetarian entree. Of the fifteen entrees offered, every single one was a hearty meat dish. I can't remember the last time I've struggled to find something meatless to eat--especially in California! Please, chef, I beg you! Add a little diversity! Vegetarians will thank you."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"While camping at Lake Cachuma stopped here for lunch and breakfast, quality food and drinks. I had the chicken sandwich with french fries and eggs and bacon with biscuits and gravay. It's a very charming lodge like cabin hidden right in the mountain. On Sundays they have live music. 
Can't wait to visit again!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Nice place to enjoy some beer, some bbq, and some music.

I'm with everyone on the 'you think you're lost' for a minute.  Driving down the windy road with no life in sight. Thank God for the Cold Spring sign!  Once we see the massive line of cars and choppers, we know we've arrived. 

The surrounding woods is a nice setting to help relax you after the drive.  Due to the holiday weekend, it was especially packed (a regular told me), which added to some long lines for drinks.  It was also a little too hot and stifling.  However, with fewer people and cooler weather, this place might be perfect. 

While the Tri-Tip sandwich was good, I wasn't blown away by it like some reviewers.  Didn't eat anything else, but the restaurant looked cramped and it was also hot, which would make for some uncomfortable eating.

Bottom line: I'm glad I went, but I don't know that I'd make the 2+hour drive again.  If I were in Santa Barbara, I'd cruise up the hill."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I love the historical essence of this place!! My family and I stopped by on our vacation while on our way to Pismo Beach and I'm glad we made it.  We did not have reservations but the staff was very friendly and got us in right away.  My kids were taken back in time...as you walk into the interior the ambiance is set by a tiny swinging door and as you walk through the artifacts on the walls are a must see.  We tried new dishes like rabbit loin and duck but also had their New York steak and bbq's ribs...all very delicious and portions were just right.  I loved the fact that employees talked to us in spanish as well.  I will recommend this restaurants to all my friends and family as a MUST SEE and EAT :)

The atmosphere is rustic and the outdoor surroundings are beautiful. The food was basic faire done at its best! Tender perfectly cooked meats in a wonderful barbecue sauce. We tried their chili sampler. They were all wonderful yet different. The service was great. We were there when they opened at 11 AM on a Thursday and it wasn't crowded at all. Would definitely go back. Worth the relaxing drive!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Take away the unique location and setting and you are left with the food which is average at least during the week.
I had the Chili Verde which is supposedly simmered for 4 hours after the meat has been braised for 2 hours however the result was chucks of chewy meat with little flavor and a thin watery broth, although the chili flavor was good. A can of Stagg's might have been better.
My wife had a spinach quiche which seemed to have been made with American cheese instead of gruyere so it lacked consistency and flavor. 
So I would say don't let the history of the tavern cloud your food expectations."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I like this place a lot. I come here with my boyfriend when we visit his parents in Santa Ynez. The tri tip is very good but i think what makes it tastes better is if you just hiked, and the atmosphere is pretty funny. Bikers music and then a lot of tourists. I think its worth checking out. When its super busy its hard to get to the bar to order your sandwich and drink."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,all good but sides we all luke warm/cold...butter not happy on them...how can this be?? for $30 a plate
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The trick to this place is to come here around noon on a cold day in the winter. No crowds, plenty of parking, excellent service, and you can sit in the back area next to the fireplace.

A favorite of my wife and me, native Californians who love to adventure."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This historic little gem hidden within the Santa Barbara mountains is a definite must see! No, it is not a Universal Studios wannabe site. (Found those mentions in reviews funny!) It is original, from the late 1800s. First building from 1896. Food is amazing (especially dinner!); BBQ weekends is delish (but get there early b4 the herd arrives- HA!); a little walk around the property is beyond serene; and/or if you just want a little getaway by yourself or with friends, this is totally the place, especially if you are en route to wine tasting in The Valley or heading back south! Or if you want to celebrate a special occasion ;) Oh yeah, and the live music on weekends-- FUN! 
Fave dish: lamb chops, rabbit, and CS chicken. Nom...nom...nom! For lunch: the chicken melt, chopped salad or any fish special. And Sunday: yummy tri-tip for sure!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Cold Spring Tavern fits its description as a mountaintop retreat. It's dark, rustic & kitschy. The dining room isn't that big so there can be a bit of a wait. However, you can place an order at the counter and eat outside. During our visit the staff got so pre-occupied with outside customers that the indoor service slipped a bit.

We had the ""famous"" chili and it was OK. It wasn't as hot as I expected. Otherwise the tri-tip sandwich and venison sausage burger were both great."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I was so excited to check this place out.  A few people raved about the tritip sandwiches, and a friend eagerly recommended their chili (which unfortunately I didn't get to try).  We got there and must've looked obviously like first timers. Confused as to what the protocol was, I saw a customer and asked her how it worked. She explained that you have to go to the bar to buy a ticket for a tri-tip sandwich, or you can go inside the restaurant and order from the menu. My wife really wanted to try the tri-tip sandwich so we went to the bar first to get that. Then we wanted to go inside the restaurant to sit down and order some other food off the menu to go with our sandwiches. There were a few people inside. I saw one of the waiters and asked him if we could have a seat. In an unfriendly tone he stated, ""no we're closed"".  Not, ""I'm sorry..."", or ""I apologize"", but simply, ""no"".  Apparently they are closed between 3 PM to 5 PM which I was unaware of. It would've been nice for the waiter to let us know that instead of just replying with a no. Anyways, we hiked up the hill and ate our sandwiches. The sandwich was overrated in my opinion. I guess when you're drinking anything taste good. Unfortunately, I remained sober this trip. The meat itself was pretty tasty but the role that they put it on was like a French bread roll and very tough, and just didn't go well. Also there were no sides, just the $10 sandwich. All in all this was a crappy experience. And though I may give it another chance during regular hours (now that I know) , this place is nothing to write home about."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is truly a hidden gem!  You're in the middle of nowhere in this rustic place with nothing but people who enjoy good food and live music.  There are benches and picnic tables for people to sit - if those are taken you can easily find a seat anywhere else - I ended up sitting on the ledge of a window and it was comfy!

I got a margarita, tri tip sandwich and found somewhere to sit.  Let me put out there - I'm not a red meat eater, so the fact that I ordered a tri tip sandwich speaks volumes! It's truly delicious! So delicious I forgot how much of it I was eating.

Then there's the water!  Water that flows from the river through this beautiful, natural place!  This is as fresh as it gets!

This place truly gives an experience like no other.  The live local band, local people/tourists and of course the bikers!  Everyone is very friendly!  I truly enjoyed the experience and can easily see myself here every time I'm in the area!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Welcome to Harlan County. If you're a Justified fan, you'll really appreciate Cold Spring Tavern, an oasis from the local Santa Barbara country club aesthetic. It has somewhat of a reputation as a 'biker' joint, which I guess it is to an extent, but think more along the lines of AFTER Pee Wee sang Tequila and bonded with the bikers instead of the before. We were there Easter Sunday, and despite looking ominously packed, we were quickly seated. A bluegrass band was playing outside, and people were helping themselves to a delicious-smelling barbecue in the back.

I had the barbecue beef sandwich, which was pretty damn good, and my friend ordered the intense onion rings, which while tasty, were more fried stuff than onion. She also said the ranch dressing was amazing. Two other girls had the pulled pork and gave it enthusiastic thumbs up. The meals weren't too overwhelmingly large and came in a timely fashion, considering we were a party of nine.

The waitress was a total sweetheart who insisted on giving me a free dessert for my birthday. 

The only downside: the bathrooms were essentially outhouses, which is less than appealing when eating dinner. 

AND as a plus, four bros on Yamaha bikes that looked more like mini vans than badass machines started catcalling my group of friends for being 'goth', asking if we were 'going to a funeral' and then warning each other that we were witches. Considering I just turned 30, I'd like to thank them for transporting me back to being 16."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,A real hidden gem....glad we came to experience the filet mignon. Don't expect perfection with the service BUT the food IS amazing...dinner was delicious.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Looking for a beautiful rustic place to have a romantic dinner? Look no further then Cold Spring Tavern. CST is hidden in the mountains about twenty minutes from Santa Barbara. To get there you have to take old highway 154 and then a little windy road called Stage Coach Road. The restaurant is nestled in the mountain side and is shaded by huge trees. You can't even see the place from the highway. CST actually consists of two buildings. One is a restaurant and the other is a small bar. CST looks like an old log cabin inside and out. The inside has lots of little tables that are lit by candle light, two fireplaces, and lots of old pictures on the walls. 

The food here is great. They serve quite a few different types of meat. Anything from steak to pork ribs to venison and even buffalo. They also have an amazing chili. I always get the sampler which will let you try three small bowls of their great tasting chilis. My favorite thing on the menu though is an appetizer. It is the mushroom caps filled with venison. The way the venison and the mushroom taste when combined is fantastic. 

The best day of the week to go though is on Sundays. On Sunday they have a guy come down and set up a BBQ outside the restaurant and serve up the world best tri-tip sandwiches. The chef is a big friendly guy who has been doing this BBQ every Sunday for as far back as I can remember. His sandwiches are too die for. The best thing is that he is not stingy when it comes to the meat. He packs those rolls full of the juiciest tri-tip you will ever taste. To put on the sandwich he has three different types of condiments. The first is salsa, the second is a great tasting sweet BBQ sauce and the third is an amazing apple horseradish. 

The service here is stellar. The people who work in the restaurant are all really nice. On Sundays when the BBQ is going on the place will get really crowded. Mostly by bikers and tourist. If you're a fan of motorcycles then I would recommend going down one Sunday. You will see all makes and models of different bikes. Also on Sundays they have bands play outside of the bar for you to enjoy will you eat your tri-tip sandwiches. 

The restaurant itself is a little pricy but well worth the money for the experience you are sure to have. On Sundays the tri-tip sandwiches are seven dollars a piece but more then likely you will end up spending fourteen bucks because they are so good you will want to have another."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This is not only a good restaurant, but one of the oldest historical locations in the state. It really is a old stage stop for the Overland stage, check out the jail behind the restaurant. It is sort of out of the way, but if traveling from LA to NorCal worth a stop for lunch or dinner. Full bar and plenty of beer."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Frustrated. Heard such wonderful things about the place. Showed up. Most tables empty and yet nobody helped us for minutes, until one did - harried and seemingly mobbed. Anyway, we were shoved into a table with a cobwebbed - yes, cobwebbed - lamp, and cobwebbed deer head above. After waiting minutes (""Should we go for it?"" ""I guess. Adventure, right?""), no one bothered to approach. Finally - when we heard that the table next to us had been waiting over a half hour for their dinner, after being delivered their salad and their check! - we decided to walk. Sad. Such amazing potential for what could be the most romantic, spectacular destination place for food. I guess it's really just a weekend roast beef sandwich place for bikers on their way in and out of Santa Barbara. What a waste."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The Cold Spring Tavern is a cool little rustic restaurant tucked away in the San Marcos pass region just north of Santa Barbara, CA- the Cold Spring was featured in Rachel Ray's $40 per day TV show. 

Atmosphere: The restaurant sitting area is located within an old cabin that served as a stage coach stop for horse and buggies travelling over the San Marcos pass.  The uneven floor, old photos, and spartan interior give the place character.  You can even stoke the fireplace with fresh firewood during winter months when the temperature drops a bit. 

Food:  The food is good, but nothing too exciting.  Simple American food served with minimal decoration and fru-fru presentation.   

Price: Breakfast/lunch is reasonable, but dinner is pricy, especially if you add wine, beer, or other alcoholic beverages.  I recommend opting for breakfast or lunch if you're on a budget. 

Bottom Line: A unique restaurant that's off the beaten path."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This was a fun experience. You have to give it a shot. You feel just like you're in the old days! It's off the beaten path but worth it. The food was great and the servers are super nice. It only lost one star cause it was rather warm in the restaurant.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"When in the Santa Barbara area, take a detour off the 154 onto Stagecoach Rd to find this unexpected, somewhat hole-in-the-wall, in the middle-of-nowhere, roadside bar and food joint.   Rickety looking old wooden buildings, ivy taking over in spots, large logs for seating outside, some picnic type tables, and benches too; tables and stools inside.  Dusty during summer, damp in the winter.

We had first passed by during a wine tour.  After the tour, we immediately made our way back to indulge in this experience.  The bar/tavern is adjacent to the restaurant.  We had just had lunch on the wine tour; our time was spent at the tavern.  The smell from the bbq wofted throughout. Live music outside and a line at the bar(s) inside.  Cold beer, happy people, all walks of life.  People all about with people leaving and arriving at a steady pace.  This is a place to return when in the area again. 

It's not hard to find, just awkward.  Expect windy roads and a grand curve and at the apex is Cold Spring Tavern.  Parking sucks, let's be honest.  If arriving by car, you'll need to find off pavement parking along the road; no sidewalk; precarious walking up the road with traffic both directions.  On motorcycle, no problem, pull right in, usually.  

As soon as I find my pics, I'll post."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a unique place. A must see. 

I had a regular hamburger, the meat was fantastic, the bun was delicious and toasted, however, the bun could have used more dressing. My husband had baby back ribs and he said they were really good. 

The reason for only four stars, they could use a fan in the dining area where we were seated. It turned out to be a very hot day. 

Recommend the place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I was absolutely floored when i saw this place.  The thick green spongy moss on the roof, the crooked-looking buildings, the sign that said it has been in operation since the 1800s...amazing!  what a gem!  
Excellent lunch specials, a nice fireplace for cold days, a good selection of beers and wines, BBQs and bands on weekends...it's well worth the drive and it'll probably be the place I go back to first next time I'm in SB."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I've been here twice on my way to Santa Maria and this place is divine!  I can't come to Santa Maria without stopping by this place.  I love the atmosphere, the bikers, the guys with the antique cars, it's awesome!  It's great how they always have a fire going in the fireplace to make the place seem even cozier.

The food here is also delicious.  I've had the tri-tip sandwich with the tasty horseradish sauce, their juicy burgers, huge crispy onion rings, their butternut squash soup, (while it was on special), and their chile con carne.  All have been wonderful. 

They also have a great wine list b/c of the proximity to the santa maria wineries.  Bloody Mary's here are also killer!

The only con about this place is that they are almost always busy.  The last time I came here, the place was packed and only two waitresses were on staff.  The service ended up being terrible + they served my medium burger well done :(  

It wasn't their fault though, with the crowd of this place, it was impossible for two girls to be able to get everything right. Try to get them at an off time because this place really is worth checking out!"

We went to Santa Barbara for our anniversary this last weekend.  While on a tour we passed the tavern.  My husband commented on their Tri-Tip Sandwich.  I asked, ""how did you know?""  To which he replied, ""Food Channel.""

We didn't get to stop that day, but we came back on Sunday which was even better.  On Sundays (All Day) you can sit outside and they BBQ/ Slow Roast Tri-Tip outside.  I went home smelling like BBQ, it was great.  The bread was soft and perfectly toasted.  There was a hot mustard and mayo mixture on the bread, along with bits of cilantro.  HEAVEN!  The sandwich is filling enough, you don't need to order fries.  Especially if you're having a beer.  You have to get a beer with your sandwich.  We had a delicious dark brown ale called Abita- Turbodog.  I asked for a small but got a large.  Oh well...  I just had to man up and drink it. :o)

The beers were $5 on tap, and the sandwich ran about $9.

So pull up a log, tap your foot to the live music, and enjoy the great outdoors!"

That to me is above and beyond service. I've worked in a kitchen, end of night is clean'n'go!

P.S. I didn't go for the veggies or salad."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I struggle with how to review this place effectively. I actually ate inside and then hung out outside to watch a band play and they were two differing experiences. Inside the restaurant it is cool to see the history behind it. I think they probably take the business for granted as its clearly a bike mecca. The service was extremely slow. I asked for my buffalo burger to not have the dressings or the mayo. They brought it ouch much later with the dressings and the mayo. When I told them that they said they would take care of it and a couple minutes later the burger was brought back out....Did they make me a new one..NO!...they scraped the mayonnaise off the burger and admitted as much when I asked. Mayonnaise literally makes me nauseous, and they said I guess we could make you another one. I said I would just deal with it and choked it down. If this wasnt bad enough, our waitress went and sat down at a table across the room with other workers and I watched her eat a salad while I waited to get my bill...for a long long time. Then they didnt take amex. Outside though the band was good the atmosphere festive and the old school bar on the property is worth checking out. I would say its worth going to to see, but skip eating there unless maybe you are just getting bbq outside as it smelled delicious and I imagine it was."

Cold Spring Tavern consists of a little restaurant, outside communal tables, and a small bar with the tiniest stage. But it's magical, a little cottage compound in the middle of the forest with different people - bikers, visitors itching to try their tri-tip. We ordered at a picnic table outside from a cool, relaxed guy. We walked our receipt over to get our tri-tip. Initially it looked dry, but it was actually perfect. We smothered the sandwich in BBQ sauce and added crispy fried onion rings to it for crunch.

We loved the ambiance. We got there a bit early so the live band hadn't showed up yet."

FYI, yes, they said,you can sit as well as order inside since there were no available tables outside.No one mentioned that they charge an additional $3.50 per, plus, of course, the tip."

We are weekend hobby motorcycle riders and love the excuse to escape to Cold Spring for a slice of pie - two hours from where we live.  

We have eaten here for lunch - food is usually pretty good (onion rings, quiche, burgers).  We recently went for dinner and the food was really good.  I had the tiger prawns with pasta in a saffron mushroom creme sauce and my husband got their antelope steak special, garlic mashed and veggies.  Both came with soup (pistachio corn chowder - yum) and homemade bread (double yum).  We also tried the stuffed mushrooms and the broth was really good.  Soaked up that broth with the bread.

Thankfully, we had a reservation for dinner.  However, the people sitting next to us were squatting on someone else's table who had a 5:30p reservation.  Shocked they didn't get booted since most showing up without a reservation were told no seating until 8:00p. Granted the squatters were pushy and I guess that's why they were granted the table.

Place is great, rustic and quietly tucked away.  I am fan but hate the service.  Awful - waitress was rude, hostess - loud and snippy.  The prices for dinner are a bit up there given the unique menu offerings and the service should match.  One day it will get better - one day!"

The food is pretty darn good on a Sunday (tri tip sandwiches-they do them well)  and you can observe your food being served up and have your sandwich custom done with a great selection of toppings and sauces, by the nicest BBQ ""chef"".  I am not so sure about having a dinner here, done that (probably won't do it again, just not my cup of tea),  I really am not sure how to rate it all (the dinner experience), so I will decline.  Back to the Sundays...all kinds of people and ""characters"" cruise on up  the mountain road,  it's nice and shady and woodsy once you arrive.  Walk around and take a look at all there is to see, you won't find this kind of a place anywhere close.  If you are the friendly type, it will be very easy to meet people and get the party rolling...lot's of alcohol gets poured here.  Or, a great place to people watch...they come from all over.  There is music, laughter, goods eats, and a rather friendly crowd.  Bikers head this way and you will see amazing (work of art) machines.

This is the kind of place you return to time and time again.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What can I say about this place?  It is absolutely unique and a true hidden gem.  My family and I first heard about it at, get this, a Grand Canyon bus stop....from a couple of biker dudes.  We had been chatting with them, mentioned I was going to school out there, and they said we HAD to go.  So, if a biker tells you to go somewhere, you go.  Or not.

Anyways, I have been here three times since and every time has been amazing.  Its totally off the beaten bath up 154, under a sweet bridge in a little valley.  Next door there is a biker bar (hence the biker recommendation) and it seems a bit rowdy.  But the restaurant is really rustic and old looking and feeling.  Its pretty classy all things considered and somewhat pricey, but totally worth it.  

They have a lot interesting options, including game (like Elk, rabbit, and I hear sometimes black bear!) as well as steak and chicken.  They elk medallions were splendiferous and so was everything else everyone got.  Add some fresh vegetables, some good wine, and delicious bread and you have an unforgettable experience.  

Go here for uniqueness, charm, and beautiful setting.  You'll love it!"

There is a band playing and tons of people sitting on benches and all around drinking a cold beer and listening to the music. 

A quick history of the tavern: It was an old stagecoach stop back in the 1800s where weary drivers and horses would stop and refuel before continuing their journey. The tavern has this old rustic feel, which really reminded me of being at Frontierland at Disneyland! 

My husband and I had the BBQ Beef Sandwich, which was tri-tip on a French roll served with this mild horseradish that I really liked. The sandwich came with an order of fries ($9.50 for the meal). \

Since we were on our way home, we didn't stay and linger with a beer and listen to music like everyone else, but I sure would like to on another visit! I actually would really love to come back for dinner here, since according to their website they were deemed the ""Best place for a romantic getaway in California."" 

Casual dress, at least for lunch, is a must."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place has it all; the atmosphere, the food, the people. The best part is driving new people there since it's tucked in the mountain it's always a pleasant surprise. Love love love."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The hubs and I went here for lunch on Sunday and boy are we glad we did!

It's about a 15-20 minute drive from downtown Santa Barbara up the mountain but it's a really lovely and scenic drive!

Thank goodness for GPS though because there are no signs for this place and it would be easy to blow right past the road. I wouldn't at all recommend going there for the first time in the dark. 

Once you turn on Stagecoach Rd, it's a couple miles down on the left hand side. When we got there it was super crowded (tons of bikers and just people in general drinking beers and having sandwiches sitting all around outside). There was also live music. 

The hubs and I were looking more for ""sit at a table and have lunch"" kind of place and thankfully there was still plenty of seating inside. 

It's confusing because the lodge/cabin looks very small from the outside and you're wondering whether people actually eat inside (because practically everyone is outside). And it's dark and there's no host/hostess stand but you just seat yourself and then someone comes over to take care of you. 

We both had the tri tip sandwich- the hubs with fries and me with a salad with the lingonberry dressing- yum! The tri tip was well cooked, good quality meat. The BBQ was smoky and yummy and the portion was pretty big- though we both ate it all! The hubs did order a dark ale beer too which he liked but it was HUGE and cost $11. Oops. The prices weren't listed on the menu. 

Service was quick but not very friendly. Our waiter was sort of ho-hum. 

Decor was very rustic but cozy and a unique little place to have lunch. It is dark inside but I guess that's part of the charm. 

We didn't stay for any music but it seemed to be pretty popular. They are short on restrooms so be prepared. A one man stall for the men and one for the ladies and then a co-ed handicap accessible restroom- not much for all the people there and all the drinking that seemed to be going on. 

Finally there is no designated parking lot so cars just park up and down the curvy road."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A friend told me about this place so we decided to stop by a few years ago. If you want to step back in time and do not expect any of the frilly dilly atmosphere of a modern venue then this is the place to stop and have a little grub. Walking in gives you a definite feel of what it must have been like in the 1860's (minus the glowing spheres) to have a meal there. Every time we travel that direction a stop is a must. Grub was good and last time we had a lot of fun watching some ""locals"" from a time warp have a meal next to us. Service was also good and pleasant. Will be agoin' again in April. Just wished I could ride my pony up and tie him to the hitchin' post.  Much obliged to the wonderful family that keeps this gem alive!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,feels like I was in wild west movie. pretty interesting...the food could be better.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a great escape for anyone who wants to get out of town, and be in a completely different environment, without spending a lot of time.  It's about fifteen minutes from Santa Barbara, but you feel like you're miles away.  The food is great, although menu selections are limited.  Salads are always fresh.  Meats are often quite exotic, and always cooked to perfection.  Vegetarians can thrive here as well!  Pick your time and day of week carefully to avoid grid-lock!  Sunday afternoons feature a great tri-tip sandwich, and plenty of local music and good drinks.  A great place to spend a rainy night next to a cozy wood fire, with a nice Cabernet Sauvignon and venison!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Lots of bikers here when we came and it was largely shut down for a wedding. Not much for little kids to do. The music was so loud it made me feel like I couldn't hold a conversation or think. My head felt cloudy afterwards. Pot smoking nearby, not necessarily a bad thing, but not kid friendly, nor do I myself smoke... it's divvy.

However, the cute gift shop there was awesome with amazing handmade boho finds. The outdoor seating and woodsy scenery is lovely. Beware the gnats, the tri tip sandwhiches are wonderful and only available on weekends... lots of flavor but I felt our meat was a bit tough. 

I think the history behind it is cool, but I probably wouldn't go back as it isn't very family oriented. My 4 year old was bored and the only thing for him to do was play with rocks and the music hurt his ears, too."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Stopped in on a Sunday morning for breakfast and was not disappointed. I had the wild game omelette with biscuit and gravy. The biscuit and gravy was was so filling itself and worth the trip, my omelette was doused in their amazing chili which I definitely want to come back for more of! My husband got the chicken fried steak. TONS of food, so so good and this place is so charming! Bloody marys to boot. On our way out they were just starting the tri-tip bbq and we saw the mountains of onion rings which looked so good we were sorry that we had eaten so much at breakfast. 
Highly recommend! Can't wait to come back for dinner..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a unique and fun experience!  When a colleague mentioned this place to me I knew we just had to check it out!  How often can you say you had a meal in Tavern that is over 150 years old? We really enjoyed exploring the outdoor area and the buildings behind the restaurant.  It's got great ambiance and the drive to get there is really beautiful.  We came on a weekday so parking wasn't an issue but we did take not of the very small dirt patch that seems to serve as the parking lot of the Tavern.  Can only imagine how crazy it gets on the weekends.  

I had a cup of the chili and a tri-tip sandwich. Both were really delicious.  I found the sauce for the sandwich to be unique and flavorful... different from most tri-tip I've had but really fantastic. Our servers were attentive and friendly and we really enjoyed checking out the decor and articles about the stagecoach stop on the wall.  

We would totally visit this place again the next time we're in town."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I love this place! I have been going to Sunday tri tip sandwiches for almost 20 years. Love the atmosphere and rustic scenery. TIP: it's cheaper to buy a 20 oz. bottle of beer from the bar and ask for 2 chilled glasses at the restaurant.  Also, this bison burger is the best. Nice juicy and thick patty on a delicious brioche bun!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Tri-tip cooked the Santa Maria way, over oak wood, served on a toasted roll with salsa, au jus, and a bit of biker love.

Ladies and gentlemen: if you take the time to find this place, or stumble across it, stop and eat here. Like an oasis on a desolate road, off the beaten path of a mountain highway of sorts. This place seems like a biker hangout if you fly by it, but it just happens that a lot of bikers ride up in the mountains, and yeah, they get hungry too.

I'll admit the only reason I ate here was because I frequent that area near SB, and I saw it on Food TV, as it is one of Chef Cat Cora's favorite meat sandwiches. So when given the chance, went hunting for this place, as that's what it is, a mountain drive hunt.

I'll skip ahead to the main details. Suffice to say, when you go into the bar to buy the sammy, look around at the interior of the place, as it kind of has that mountain cabin lodge vibe going on.

The meat was as tri-tip should be cooked - over oak wood, on the Santa Maria style grill, basting in its own juices. We had a selection of options of different toppings/sauces (salsa, horseradish, au jus, etc.) on sliced beef atop a grill toasted roll. Totally good, and a textbook epitomization of what this California delicacy is all about.

Cat Cora being a resident of Santa Barbara, she has made a few other recommendations I have noted over the years, and hope to venture down to them eventually. She didn't steer me wrong here, being a mutual lover of the tri-tip, and if you know you are either passing through the area, or live nearby, take the short trip up into the mountains to find this place. Not a bad little place to stop off at.

Cheers."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great ambiance! Great food! Live music on the weekends! 

I saw this place featured on the Food Network and decided to make a small day trip out here just to try out the tri-tip sandwiches. So, yeah, I guess I was being a touristy noob :P 

The drive and the scenery was absolutely breath taking, it was so lush and green, I almost wished there was a hiking trail nearby so I could enjoy the beautiful hills and the tiny little river that bubbled along. 

The restaurant itself made me feel claustrophobic, the food and the menu was just meh~ to me, nothing really to write home about. Solid fare: BBQ ribs, Beef sandwiches, Burgers, Chili etc. It was tasty, but not really outstanding. They seated us right next to the open fireplace with was nice b/c it was cold. 

The real treasure is outside though... They had live music, and a huge BBQ grilling station outside for their tri tip sandwiches. There is a little collection of random old miner era buildings in the back which is interesting, and a little house that someone wrote ""I pooed""d here"" on in huge red letters. 

We got the tri tip sandwiches, and listened to live music and mingled with bikers. It was definitely an experience and I would recommend this place to tourists... mainly b/c it's really a one of a kind experience. Where else can you experience an old miner town feel restaurant with an outdoor BBQ, with bikers and live music surrounded by stunning nature?"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Quite an experience. I was in town visiting on vacation and was brought here as a highly coveted local spot. 

Don't expect to talk on the phone, there's little or no cell service here. You're in the woods!

Come on a Sunday for a day of light beer and onion rings. If you're feeling traditional, order a steak sandwich (tri-tip). I don't even eat steak but did really enjoy a few bites with the salsa dip. Choose 3 sauces to dress your sangie with, they're on ice by the tri-tip bar where your steak is cut by hand in front of you. 

Get a seat close to the live band outside if you're lucky. Come before 3 or 4 when the love music moves indoors."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A superb establishment! The setting, the seating, the ambiance, and the food are smashing. Glad I made the drive up, I'll be going back often.
(ps -  the chili sampler was AAA+)"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"30 years ago this used to be a hidden gem, a total biker place, but now seems more upscale, even touristy.  Perhaps this is because I came in for dinner rather than lunch, but I miss the eclectic feel of biker meets hiker meets hippy dippy.  Now it felt more like the affluent wants to play dress up in cowboy boots... $90 for dinner with 4 beers- certainly not what I remember. Sure, some of the old feel is there, but not so much in the restaurant in the evening.

CST is still very cool and beautiful, and I will definitely head back again, but in the afternoon after a hike, perhaps a lunch beer and tri-tip will be more reasonable, and with the casual feel that used to be present at this hidden little secret."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"FOOD POISONING ALERT!  I got food poisoning from this place and come to find out 2 out of 3 of my friends had eaten there the previous week and they had vomiting and diarrhea too.  We all had their BBQ sandwiches.  Mine was the pork and they had the brisket. Stick to the beer and the adventure in visiting this place but be avoid the BBQ sauce (?) I guess.  It also was not very good.  Without food poisoning, I would rate it 2 stars but with food poisoning 0 stars but since I have to rate it 1 star.  I know a lot of people like this place but maybe they should do a deep cleaning."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Wow, what a scene!  The other descriptions do it justice.
I am still drooling over the rack of elk that I ate here . . . wow, that's one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had (the wine reduction sauce didn't hurt).  The ambiance makes it even better.

My only complaint was that there was a $7 charge for splitting a dish, which somehow my entire party of 10 didn't see on the menu.  But when we mentioned it, the manager took the charge off."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"5 stars for keeping this location alive.  Lisa and I had a great lunch here. Some have complained about the lighting but Hello it's an 1886 stagecoach stop.   I liked the atmosphere and food.  I had the Pulled pork BBQ and Lisa had the meat quiche.  Both were excellent.  Lunch, local beer and an iced tea were $34.   No complaints."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"COOL location, it's a hidden gem! On Sundays only, they cook the best Tri-Tip ever!! There is also an amazing fine dining restaurant in the old cabin next door, but their Sunday Tri-tip is the best sandwich I've ever eaten. I love going here; you eat outside & it feels like you're visiting a place in the 1800's !"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Awesome place. Built in the 1800's food atmosphere is amazing. Highly recommend. Rustic atmosphere and a little hard to get to but definately worth it.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This is a blast to the past.  A very old bar that has history and a great tri-tip sandwich.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Husband took me for my birthday.  He made a reservation for Saturday, and I suggest that since it is a smaller place.  Tucked away in the mountainside, it's all about the atmosphere, but the food is great too.  I had the rabbit, and he had the wild boar.  Earthy, rustic, historic, love it.  I posted pictures."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern is one of the restaurants mentioned on California's 100 Bucket List and since my friend and I were in SB, we decided to check it out. It has a 150 year history and can easily be overlooked when passing through the Los Padres National Forest. Upon arrival, I noticed the limited parking space but even more drawn to how quaint it was. Known for their tri-tip sandwiches, we just had to order it. It came with 2 sauces and salsa. I had it with my usual fries and my friend had this potato pea soup thing. That was delicious! The tri-tip was good but could've been more tender. The ambiance and decor definitely earned the stars for me! Highly recommended for anyone who'd like to enjoy a meal away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Santa Barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,One of my favorite spots! There is a very homey feeling. Everyone is just having a good time listening to the bands and enjoying the surroundings. You've never been to a place like this.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This was a great lil stop on the way to santa Barbara. Talk about stepping back in time. It's such a cool feeling to know the history and that grill going outside. Yum! The onion rings were bomb and the steak was very good and low priced. Highly recommend
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Unfortunately unless your heading there on Saturday for a tri-tip sandwich or a drink at the bar, it is not worth your time. Location is great. The restaurant.... is shit."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I've passed by this place a few times when I was in the area and it was always busy. The day I went was the busiest I had seen it. It was on a Sunday about 1:30. Live music. Lots of cars and bikes. Everyone seemed to be in such a good mood, smiles all around. Walked in and within a few minutes had a seat inside. Most people sit outside or are there for the separated bar and are just hanging out. So don't let the crowd deter you!
I got the tri tip sandwich and my better half got the French dip. I won't lie it wasn't the BEST I had ever had but was definitely good. Onion rings were amazing, must try! So if the review was just for food 3 1/2 maybe 4 stars because onion rings lol
What really made this place was the service. Our server (Paxton) was a super cool guy and made the experience so much better than it could have been. Very attentive and did what he could to keep us happy. I'll be back just because of our service from him.
The atmosphere was a major plus. They had a lot to look at while waiting for the food and was like no other restaurant I have ever been too. 
If you're in the area it's worth the stop!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Put it on your Bucket list. Great place to drive or ride your bike.

Passing out this way!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Sunday tri-tip sandwiches and music! Definitely worth the short drive up the 154.  VERY casual, backroads kind of feel at this time.  Lots of bikets and regulars, most everyone (customers) was pretty friendly.  My huband, inlaws and two small kiddos went.  Only tri-tip sandwiches on the grill (very tasty with BUCKETS of sauce to add on yourself), my vegetarian husband had a delicious grilled cheese with carmelized onions and my toddler had an impressive ham sandwich.  There were a few other families there too, the kids enjoyed playing around the picnic tables further away from the road.  A GREAT way to spend a Sunday afternoon"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This place has somewhat of a split personality.  Or at least it did when I was here on a Saturday night for dinner.

After winding through the mountains and surviving the setting sun glaring into our eyes, all the while wondering how the many motorcycles that make their way here ever actually GET here safely, we scored a parking spot in their lot.

The creek that trickled below and the thicket of trees and rocks that I could see just beyond the lot made me want to climb down and up and all around.  The fact that the bullfrogs were just starting to really ribbet as the sun was setting made me itch to climb down those rocks even more, so I could make a grab for a chubby one!

We were early for our dinner reservations, so we followed the sound of the band into the bar and sat and listened and watched people dance for a bit.  The vibe was laid back and warm and casual and fun.

About 10 minutes before our reservation time, we checked in at the restaurant next door.  The girl who greeted us was polite but not overly friendly when she told us they were running a little behind.  Since we had the time, we wandered around the side of the restaurant and back, where little rustic buidings had signs that explained they were old jail cells and even living spaces.  Neato to look at, and clearly original in their structure.  (Bring a flashlight if you want to be able to see the inside of these structures in the evening)

The sun had set by now, but the sky was bright enough with moonlight to see bats out hunting for bugs.  Neato!!  

We ended up being seated about 25 minutes late for our reservation.  Honestly, for how slow this was, the attitude didn't match the level of apology that I would think is appropriate.

While the bar next door is casual and warm, the vibe in the restaurant is definitely different.  The wood plank floors and rustic walls and decor make it feel very casual, because nobody dresses up to come here.  The menu items include exotics like venison, and also traditional things like prime rib, chicken, and lamb, but aren't super pricey.

The service here however is on the cold side.  Cold, like we think we're a high end restaurant so we're going to be un-warm, in a fashionable way.  or at least that's how our server was.  And it's all wrong in my opinion.  This is a rustic place!  The bar next door is loud and warm!  But you walk in to the restaurant, and it's hushed tones, slow service, and just okay food?  Hm. 

All dinners come with either soup or chili or salad.  The salad was a nice mix of dark leafy greens with grated carrots on top and a couple of cucumbers.  The chili with beans was tasty, but a little salty for my salt-sensitive palate.  The bread basket had thick slices of warm white and wheat bread that was squishy and good with butter. 

Prime Rib - one of the daily specials.  I think that it was sliced and then cooked again, which when it comes to prime rib is odd.  It was chewier than any prime rib that I've ever had and medium rare when I asked for rare.  My veggies were far too crunchy for cooked cauliflower and carrots.

Boneless Half Chicken - this was really good.  Moist and flavorful, with a crispy skin.

Apple Cobbler - served warm but not with vanilla ice cream as I think cobbler should always be served, but with whipped cream - clearly from a can.  The crumb topping was good, and the tart apple filling had a nice amount of cinnamon and lemon zest.

Our not so friendly server never checked on us throughout the meal.  The busser was the one person who we did see a lot of, who WAS warm, who delivered our food, checked on us, refilled our waters, took our empty plates, and then even wished us a safe drive home and a good night.  Why isn't HE a server, I ask?

Oh, I should clarify - our server did crack a warm smile - when he dropped off our check.  Which is honestly the worst time to break out your smile, dude, because everyone knows why you've timed this to come with the check.

I would definitely come back here, just because the rustic scenery around here is so gorgeous and the bar vibe was so warm.  I've heard a lot about the tri-tip sammich that Cat Cora called out on The Best Thing I Ever Ate, and we even saw (and smelled) the outdoor grills that cook said tri-tip.  So I'd come back for that, and hope for a warmer lunch-time vibe."

I will be returning to this place. Nice drive minutes away from 101fwy."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Recommend it as a nice stop in the 154 highway.  The turnoff is on the south side of the long bridge on Stagecoast trail.  Not marked well.  Burger was huge and tasty.  Tri-tip sandwich a bit disappointing since other reviewers raved.  Suggest sharing a burger which comes with fries or green salad.

I went on June 29,2013 for our four year anniversary. 
Excuse my language but this place was #$%^ing incredible. 
We got the tri-tip sandwich from outside and my boyfriend got the venison burger. While we waited we also got the chilli sampler (this was @#$%ing amazing). We drove all the way from los angeles. I thought it was awesome. I was taken away by how cool this place looks. The employees were not very attentive, but it was okay because my tri-tip sandwich was the bomb and it made up for anything bad! I crave it so much right now. I'd go there again."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"In the mountains. Great atmosphere. A little hot in the day and a little cold at night so plan accordingly. Staff is always top. Full bar with great food. Always something original to try. Like rabbit, boar, pheasant, venison, buffalo and I even once had kangaroo. They have an amazing game chili with lots of meat. Great at night for a romantic dinner. Great during the day for a cheaper fun outing."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Possibly my new home away from home. Restaurant, bar, bbqs, they have it all. Rustic and tucked away in the woods. You'll leave smelling like a campfire but who cares when you can eat venison meatballs! 

This place is worth the detour just for the scenery alone, but the food can't be beat."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I've eaten here for breakfast and lunch but I'm a bigger fan of the breakfast. Come hungry.  A ton of food.  Great service.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is the real thing. Takes you back in time sitting inside. On the afternoon that we stopped by, there was also a live band playing outside. Their chili sampler is phenomenal and portions are sized to stuff a mid sized rhino."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,A little pricey and out of the way but we did well and they did well.  The food was good and the service was great ... they had plenty of stiff to entertain the kids.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I am so sad to have to give it only two stars. I've been coming to Cold Spring for special occasions and the occasional Sunday afternoon tavern music for nearly 10 years now. What happened to these guys? When I first came in 2003, the service was perfect and the food was awesome. Since then the food has remained 90% awesome, with one exception when they apparently lost their chef or something. But the service and particularly the attitude of the staff now reminds me of an unripe persimmon. Not a Fuyu persimmon, but one of those that you have to let get really soft before you can eat it. Ever bite into one of those? Awful! 

Honestly, Cold Spring Tavern has been the spot for some of my most memorable days. But this past Thanksgiving, my daughter and I were treated like ""newcomers"" - even asked when we made the reservation when we asked for an obviously available better table. Turned out there were two great two seat tables available. We got one after quite a huffy persimmon like hostess deigned to seat us there. The other one remained empty the entire time. Were they trying to allow the table of 12 to have the room to themselves? I have no idea. I still can't figure out why they wanted to seat us in the crowded front room when better tables were available.

THEN... forget about attentiveness. The table of 12 next to us got water refills - we had to ask, and then it took forever - even after seeing the waitress pouring for the other table.

Does the management at Cold Spring Tavern teach their staff that the public is ""lucky"" to get to eat there? That's the impression I got. It was as if they thought I should have been grateful that they honored my reservation at all! ""That's the way we do things here."" I was told. WOW!

Thanksgiving day should have been a fun and joyful experience for my daughter and I. Instead, we were rushed through dinner - even told that we had to leave by 3:30 pm or 4 pm at the latest, and left very disappointed. it was just before 4 pm and the entire place was nearly empty. A couple of groups of diners were outside waiting for their tables. There was no reason to treat us like that.

In comparison, the previous year we went to The Loft at the Montage in Laguna Beach where the service was perfect. I mean PERFECT! And the food as well. The rest of the weekend, we went to a number of places in Los Olivos where we thoroughly enjoyed both the food and the experience. 

Cold Spring needs to get their act together - maybe get some training. The magic of your location disappears when the service sucks."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great location, great quality and portions of food. Sunny rocks as a server and makes a mean margarita."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"My guess is most people take comfort in antiquity like a crutch, to which this place just oozes in history. This woodsy ensemble of sheds sits snugly among a grove of riparian trees as smoke billows gently out its chimneys. It feels like elves would spring out from its creaky doors to welcome you to this humble woodland tavern.

I am afraid the food was not quite as evocative as its setting or its building style. The mixed meat omelette of venison, rabbit and bison was edible but not anything out of the ordinary. The quantity was larger than my rather voracious appetite so in that respect it hit the hunger spot."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Has seen on Food Network's Best Place I've Eaten & Rachael Ray's $40 a day show.

The location and the ambiance is definitely worth visiting. We came here for lunch. The BBQ tri tip sandwich was delicious but our favorite was the Venison sandwich. We had a good service, and a great window seat. While eating, you will hear birds chirping and feel the breeze of fresh air. 

Make sure to take a photo of the directions because you lose cell signal once you are close to the restaurant."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I definitely recommend Cold Spring to anyone in the area.  The tri-tip is fantastic and the atmosphere is uniquely great.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I really wanted to love this place more. It had such great reviews, my coworkers talked this place up, and it was the perfect dinner spot for my romantic date night that happens maybe, oh, twice a year (thank you kids!!)

Don't get me wrong. The ambiance is FANTASTIC. I loved the old timey feel and the history. The little babbling brook on the side by the parking was the perfect spot for a photo op. They had an awesome fire pit and music and I absolutely loved it all. 

Where my experience went south was the food. Never mind our waiters poor attitude- for starters, I knew this was a pricey restaurant, so therefore my expectations were high. The salad wasn't very good to start, but I was really holding out for the two NY steaks we ordered. Mine was with the peppercorn sauce for $3 more, and my man's was plain. Both medium rare, with garlic mashed and veggies.

What we got, was not that. My man's steak was well. Mine was fine. The peppercorn sauce was good, but not the best. The veggies were great. Our mashed was plain, not garlic. My $10 wine was meh, but my man'a porter was pretty decent. We asked the waiter to return the steak, because for $26, my man wanted to enjoy it. What we got back was a rare steak. Rare to the point where it was cold and undercooked. We asked for a to-go box to take it home and heat it ourselves. When we got the bill, not even a hint of an ""I'm sorry"" discount. We paid our $85 bill and left disappointed."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"All around just an awesome place to dine or have a beer. The atmosphere is incredibly neat with all the history that surrounds this place. I love hanging out by the fire, and eating a hamburger that is as big as my face. I love to stop in whenever i'm in Santa Barbara. 

Just go, already! You won't regret it!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Here is a guide for first-timers to Cold Springs Tavern:

1. On the weekends they serve their famous tri tip sandwiches outside for $9.25 each. They give you cups of water for free. They are big sandwiches with a generous portion of meat and self-serve toppings (BBQ sauce, a semi-spicy white sauce with coarse ground mustard and salsa). To get your sandwich you must buy a ticket inside at the bar and then get in the second line for your sandwiches. 
2. Dogs are not allowed on tri tip days because of the outdoor food. 
3. Expect a crowd. A big crowd. When we visited on a Sunday at around 1pm I would estimate that there were 50+ cars, 30+ motorcycles, and more coming all the time. It is tucked away on a windy road and you will have to park on the side of it and walk. There is a parking lot for motorcycles but not for cars.
4. The music starts on Sundays at 1:30 p.m.

My experience was three stars because of the crowd. We had our dog so my boyfriend ran in to get the sandwiches, and as I sat in the car I saw three separate couples park, walk in and walk back empty-handed. I can only assume that they saw the line and decided against it. I will say the sandwich was tasty and the bread really made it. The bread is so important on the sandwich. 

If you own a motorcycle, check this place out. It is motorcycle heaven."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Amazing find nestled in the wooded valley just prior to the San Marcos pass bridge. Tri Tip, drinks, live music & real people. What more can ya ask for. They keep it humble, at this icon establishment!!!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I really wanted to love this place, and I'm giving it five stars for ambience, three for food.  It's a wonderfully funky old former stagecoach stop that's been around for over a hundred years, tucked way up in Cold Spring Canyon between the Santa Ynez Valley and Santa Barbara.   Reminiscent of Manka's or the Saddlepeak Lodge in LA, it's basically a log cabin with a roaring fireplace and walls decorated with hunting trophies.  The service is professional, the atmosphere is casual and intimate, and the food ranges from pretty good (particularly the venison-stuffed mushroom appetizer) to meh.  I wouldn't rush back but it's definitely worth a visit, just to experience the unique environment.  They also have a hoppin' bar (particularly popular with Harley riders) - may be best to experience for drinks, or Sunday brunch."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"It was a long drive to find this place and I wasn't even sure if we ever would, but oh so worth it! I went there with my friend and our kids and (our kids are used to fine dining, not the typical chicken nugget, food mill eating kids) Everything we had from the Elk to the Rabbit was delicious! Service was warm, attentive and knowlegable. Loved it!
Be aware that they close between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, we didn't and got there at 3:15, so we just sat outside with some wine and enjoyed natures beauty and the sounds from the creek nearby. Worth the drive and the wait:)"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Hopefully, everyone knows about this place!

Five stars just for the history in and around. 

Food? 
Definitely time honored. Indoor service has always been good though, it can become a bit dicey when the tavern is swamped. Parking is limited and sometimes the road becomes even narrower due to roadside parking. Especially weekends.

BBq baby back pork ribs cooked to perfection! 
Chili is always a hit especially the Wild game black bean chili!
Tri tip. Anything tri tip here is mouthwateringly wonderful! Uncomplicated sandwiches that go down well with anything from the fully stocked bar.

Live entertainment inside the bar next door or outdoors on weekends.
 
Weekend tri tip BBq's always a hit! The most quaint indoor seating. Great outdoor seating areas and plenty to keep you preoccupied throughout the property.

Great day trip! Plenty to do in the area . . 

To name a few . . .
Lake Cachuma
Jalama Beach
Los Alamos
Los Olivos
Solvang
Santa Barbara yada yada."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Grilled cheese sandwich and onion rings were definitely two great choices. 
Draft beer was $10...seems a bit steep, though good.

Bad choice---- the tri-tip.  I watched the guy preparing it pick it off the grill with his fingers, while I stood there watching bugs land all over the bread he had just buttered!  He then proceeded to take my food ticket from me with the same hand!!!!   The tri-tip was way undercooked and super  chewy.

Not sure if I would go back.

If you decide to venture there I would recommend eating inside the restaurant  to avoid the bugs and dirty hands of those preparing your food!

Also, they don't allow dogs on the weekends.  Not sure why."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"If you order the Bar-B-Q Beef Sandwich, ask for more napkins before you start eating.

As I sat there eating my sandwich, fries, and onion rings, it crossed my mind a few times that my napkin was worn out and I probably should ask for another, but I didn't car because I was busy stuffing my face!

This place feels like it's straight out of 1885. I looked all around for Doc, Marty, and a DeLorean time machine, but couldn't find them anywhere. 

The food was great! The services wasn't. Would I go back? Sure!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"this eatery is all charm, and definitely worth the short drive out of Santa Barbara. The chili sampler was great, but even better was my friend's tri-tip sandwich.  Very good food in a great setting."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Very cool place to stop at on the way or even as your destination.  Good food and the look and cozyness of the restaurant makes it seem even better. Will definitely go back and hopefully catch the live music that goes on in the town on weekends.  It's also a nice place to stop with the kids and walk the small town and check out the old buildings which go back to the 1800's when the Wells Fargo stagecoach came through.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,One of the best tri-tip sandwiches I have eaten. Glad I stopped by this hidden gem on my way home from camping in lake Cachuma.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Ours was a breakfast experience -- a weekend in late October. We were a largish party, and we arrived early before the crowds. I honestly don't think I've ever had a better breakfast, or been treated more courteously, anywhere else. I would have been happy just sticking with biscuits and gravy, but everything else was also to die for. When I expressed curiosity about the chili, our server brought me a small cup of it -- for free. Not saying you'd have the same luck I did, but it's little kindnesses like this you remember.

It helps that the setting is straight out of the wild west, or at least wild old California. It is not fancy but rather very, very casual in a building that should be declared a museum of local history. It reminded me of Sierra roadhouses my parents took me to back in the 1950s. 

Long may they run."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT IN SB.  I went to college at UCSB- and this is my #1 place to come to when I come back.  I haven't eaten at the restaurant- but on the weekends they BBQ tri tip outside and it is amazing.  By far the best tri-tip I've ever had.  Everything is great about this place- the atmosphere, the bikers, the buttery bread, the meat, and all the amazing sauces.  

this place is a MUST DO if you're visiting or live around the area.  I've been making an 1.5 hour drive every few months for a sandwich!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Well, we were heading down to the LA area for the weekend so the SO and I decided to go down 101 instead of our usual boring I-5 route. After watching a review from Cat Cora (from the food network) about Cold Spring Tavern we decided to stop in Santa Barbara for lunch. My GPS warned me that we would be going on some ""unverified roads"" and that always means an area off the beaten path. Off 101 we climb up a stretch of road and head into the Los Padres National Forrest and start to wonder ""what did we get ourselves into?"" We come upon a very charming shack (and I mean that in the nicest way!) come to find out it was a stage coach stop back in the day and not much has been done since. We put our name in and enjoy a short wait outside enjoying the beautiful surroundings. 

Once inside, I ordered the lunch special which was a BBQ sandwich and the SO ordered the French Dip. Both were delicious while the service was courteous and friendly. The meat was sliced thick and was very flavorful with a great smoke infused flavor along with a tangy BBQ sauce that wasn't over the top. The SO's french dip had nice slices of tri tip and came with an Au Jus with super flavor. All in all a great find and a fun place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My favorite place to go for lunch on Sunday! Live music, nice smoky smell from the outdoor grills, DEEEEElicious bbq beef (tri tip) sandwiches!!! 
And, their onion rings...WOW. Food is great. Don't forget to try a salad with REAL original Hidden Valley Ranch dressing! And the historic buildings are such a treat!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Wow wow wow! This place was recommended by a friend who goes to SB a lot and I am so glad we listened! 
It's out of the city for sure, but the drive is beautiful and you can drive up into the mountains on your way back to the city.
We didn't know what to expect when we walked in the door. And when were looked in, it looked like the smallest restaurant! However there are multiple rooms and there was no wait and we had our choice of which room we wanted to sit in. We chose a nice table by the window for a view. 
Alright, on to the food. I ordered the Buffalo Burger which was bigger than my face! My boyfriend had the Venison sandwich. We also started with the beer-battered onion rings - again the biggest onion rings I'd ever seen! And they were AMAZINGLY good! 
The staff was attentive (though I never did get a refill on my iced tea) and nice considering how young they all looked! Prices were fine for the amount of food you get. 
Overall, fun atmosphere, great food, great location - GO HERE!
I'm uploading some of the photos from our meal for a better feel!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is a gem. Steeped in local history and ensconced in a beautiful natural setting, and near an architectural marvel, as well: the Cold Springs Arch Bridge. Five stars for ambience and setting, 3 stars for food."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We have been coming here for years and it continues to be an outstanding restaurant and experience.  Food is delicious, rustic/western ambience is unique and cozy, and service is top notch.  Highly recommend and will definitely be coming again next time we're in town."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"My family has been going to Cold Springs Tavern for years and we love the atmosphere and the food. However, my friends and I booked the outdoor space for an evening graduation after-party, and we were extremely disappointed with the way the event planner Alexis handled the night. Over the course of the night, Alexis was rude and disorganized. She yelled and rolled her eyes at one of the people attending the event for accidentally spilling a drink, and could not keep track of the bill when it came time to pay. In addition, there were multiple hidden fees in the bill, such as a $10 plate fee on top of the $30 for each meal, and a $2 cake-cutting fee per person. None of these fees were discussed with us beforehand, and contributed to chaos and confusion at the end of the night. When Alexis couldn't resolve the bill, one of the members of our event stayed an extra hour and a half to figure it out. The space itself was beautiful and the food was delicious (although a bit overpriced for the portion size) but I would NOT recommend planning an event here- you will have to do most of the work yourself, and it gets very pricey."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"So let me start off by saying the three stars are for the location and black bean chili. 

I had been planning a birthday lunch getaway for about a month. I was so excited to come see this hidden gem for the first time with my boyfriend. Upon arriving I thought OMG it's so gorgeous this is awesome it's living up to its expectations. 

WRONG!!!! The hostess was awesome she was so considerate and gave us choice of sitting where we wanted. As soon as we sat down all we could hear was the LOUD Mexican music coming from the kitchen and apparently one of the cooks thinking he could actually sing. That right there killed the ambience. Next was the spiderwebs and bugs on our table. I get this place is old but could use some cleaning. 

There was one server in particular who was amazing but I didn't catch his name he had tattoos and a Mohawk I think. 

The food was really good but that all ended when th waiters just stood around talking and ignoring all the customers. I went without a refill for 8 minutes while a guy next to our table had to ask 6 different people for water since no one came to fill it.

So lunch is now done... Thank god.. So We go to walk around and Check this place out and the general store is shut down and now LOUD MEXICAN MUSIC is playing outside for the tri tip cookers. I think management needs to reconsider hiring certain employees. This whole birthday experience was way worse than I could of imagined. :("
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Ok!  This is one of the cutest places I've ever been.  Old converted house into a restaurant.  I really wanna come for Sunday!  But until then this experience was great.  Food was a 4 but good and different.  Go if u have a chance
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Thanks Cat Cora for the recommendation.  Casey and I have ventured up the mountains of Santa Barbara to satisfy our tri-tip craving two or three times now, ever since hearing about this place.  On the weekends (and I think just Sundays during non-summer months), they do their famous tri-tip sandwiches that you order in the bar (pay attention, because it's not obvious to figure out), and then you take your sandwich ticked up to the grill.  They give you a hefty portion of tri-tip laid on an oh-so melt-in-your-mouth roll.  There's a couple sauces and au jus to choose from.  And then you eat.  Perfection.  There are plenty of places to sit outside, accompanied by several biker dudes/chicks.  Great place to go if you're visiting SB or if you live in SB and have visitors (carnivores)."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is such a fun, romantic spot. The food is great and the live music tops it off! I come from Lompoc with my husband quite frequently just to come here because we enjoy it so much. We try to get something different each time and everything we have tried here has been great."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"The Amazing:
Hands down one of the best tri-tip sandwiches I've ever had. There is a huge caveat though. They don't make them. Instead an outside caterer comes in every weekend and builds these vegetarian ruining slices of paradise. Just to warn you the sandwiches are illegal in Texas. 

So if you find yourself within 20 miles of this place on a weekend then you would be seriously remiss for not getting your lunch here. And tip the man with cash! When you purchase ticket inside to retrieve your sandwich do NOT think that tipping there will get to the master behind the grill. It won't. 

The Terrible:
The restaurant & bar. Overpriced, bland and uninspired food. The staff has to put up with a boat load of tourists and it shows. The customer service is severely lacking  in both the restaurant and the bar. I feel like I'm in a noisy night club downtown surrounded by hot chicks trying to get noticed by an overstimulated bar tender."

There was long wait line  as we arrived around 2pm on saturday. We were told 30-40 min, probably it was 20-25 which we did not wasted at all - there is so mach great stuff to see around.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I happened to be in the Santa Ynez Mountains camping and had heard about this spot through fellow campers.  We went to the pub next door for a casual dinner and returned the following night to check out Cold Spring Tavern.

It is an experience unlike anything I have ever seen.  The place is a time warp and such a trip!  Who would have ever thought a delish restaruant would be tucked away in the mountains.

We went for dinner and had:
Venison Sausages
Baked Artichoke Hearts
New York Steak
Pork Chops

It was heeaaavy food but so good.  Definitely a neat place for any foodie to experience."

It was the highlight of our road trip from Carpinteria to SLO. My wife, daughter and I were all very pleased with our meals.....great tri tip sandwich, pulled pork, french fries and fresh potato salad.....Mmmmm. Obviously, I now see from the plentiful reviews on Yelp, it's a place of interest and for good reason.Take the turn off to Cold Stone Tavern and enjoy!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,So huge let down tonight. Rude service. Understatement. Good? My tri tip tough baked potato cold but...most amazing sauces ever and great great beans. I would give food another chance maybe at lunch but will never go back due to the service.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"First thing I'll say is that the service was just fine. We were there on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed and they seemed to be short-handed, but the ladies did their best.

The food however...

Not sure how anyone can claim ""real Texas style chili"" and then serve a bland bowl of tomato soup and beans. Anyone who knows anything about Texas Chili knows it doesn't have beans. Go to the grocery store and buy a packet of McCormick's Chili Seasoning mix, follow the directions, and enjoy better chili than what we got at Cold Spring.

The Charbroiled New York steak was just OK, pretty thin for a $24 steak and totally unseasoned. I've had better steaks at (insert any chain restaurant here.)

The locally brewed Porter I ordered with dinner was the best part of the meal. Wish I could remember what it was called.

I don't know how this place gets all the positive reviews. The novelty of the atmosphere wears off pretty quickly."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"The good; reasonably priced quality food in a beautiful remote setting. 
The bad; cramped interior, no outdoor service the time we were there. 
I can't see making the special trip to get out there. If you are on a road trip and can work your way over there, it's a positive experience."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"So sad. I'm from the Central Coast, and have always wanted to eat at the tavern... Problem is, every time Im on the 154 its because Im going somewhere, not to a cave of a restaurant.;;
  So, the atmosphere is pretty cool. Very fitting of the name, I felt like an old miner or something. It was also effing freezing in the place. Wore my coat and clutched my coffee the entire time- thats how cold it was. Bummer. The service was great, friendly and prompt. What disappointed was the food. It wasn't bad, just lacking. Every element left flavor to be desired.... 
   Nothing I'll go out of my way for, but Id try again if I were in the ballpark..."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The food was really good but it wasn't the over-the-top best tasting sandwich ive ever had. I got the tri-tip sandwich and my bf got the venison burger. We both liked the tri-tip better.

Note: if you buy the stuff on the menu (venison burger) outside, you have to eat it outside in their outdoor seating. Otherwise, you have to order it inside with the waitress to eat inside. 
It was a beautiful day so my bf and I didn't mind. 

They also give you a lot of meat. Even though I was full, I had to go get something refreshing after. 

I would come back. Not because the food was that good, but because the scenery was so pretty. 

Warning: the salsa is spicy!

Also, theres not really a parking lot. You park on the side of the road but it's not too bad and not too far of a walk."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Very good service, delicious tri tip, good iced tea, lovely location, and super pretty drive.  Limited parking, but go for early dinner mid week and you'll find plenty of parking.  Great photo ops."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Ventured here after a hike and it was such a treat! The location was adorable and rustic. The restaurant was in a cabin with vines covering it and there was indoor and outdoor seating. We decided to eat outside because there was live music playing. We ordered the tri tip sandwich with potato salad and it was great. My only thing was they were not very generous with the potato salad and I would have preferred if the meat had sauce on it in the sandwich. However, they did have Bbq sauce on the side. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I want to go back again soon and bring more friends!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The famous trip-tip sandwiches were too hyped up for me. It was good, but actually a bit of a disappointment. It was not the softest I've had, the bread was decent, the sauces were good.

The actual restaurant has usual food, but the sandwiches you order from outside. They put garlic butter on the bread and toast it on the grill for you. You have 3 choices of sauces for your sandwich, self-serve. BBQ, horseradish, and salsa. The BBQ and horseradish were really good, didn't try the salsa. Heard it was pretty hot though.

The service was quite lacking. We had a big group with several children. Our waitress was cold, aloof, and almost straightout rude.

The ambiance is what bumped it up to 4 stars for me. Very rustic, original, and unique. The food aside from the trip-tip sandwiches were just so-so. 

Get there early, the parking is terrible."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Came here with a friend after a romantic trip to Solvang (30 min north). The locals consistently described it as ""rustic"" and urged us to visit. The restaurant is on the smaller side but has several dining rooms. It is definitely quaint but certainly not run-down, as I had assumed from the description!

We were promptly seated and asked our server to light the gas lamp (he did). There feature a bunch of wines by the glass, most of which are locally sourced. I tried the 2 pinot grigios and settled on the latter. My friend found a red to her liking.

I splurged on an 8 oz burger made with beef form the Zaca winery in Los Olivos we had just been to! It was cooked to perfection and served with the fixings. The fries were excellent. My friend had the chili sampler, which was quite good (although we couldn't taste much difference between them, I'm not really a chili eater). She took her leftovers home. Lastly, we noticed the veggie squash quiche special so we split an order of that. It was also great!

Service, food, and ambiance were all superb. 5 stars!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I was excited to go here with my family and friends during our trip to Santa Barbara/Solvang.  It's hidden away and pretty charming looking, and we got some great photos.  That's about it though.

We had tried to call the day prior, explaining that we had a party of 5 and knew that the place was pretty small.  They assured us that it would be fine and we could just come in at lunch with no problem.  Well.....we did that and sure enough at 12:30 they were on a 45 minute wait.  The waitress looked at us dumbfounded when we arrived and asked  if we had a reservation AND then proceeded to tell us (when we explained what we had be told) some convoluted thing like ""well we don't do reservations, only the cooks can do reservations but sometimes we have to.""  Does that make any sense? 

I guess the point is, if you would rather spend 45 minutes sitting around for a pretty basic sandwich when you could be touring all that Santa Barbara has to offer then you may want to stop here.  For us it was worth taking a photo and hitting the road."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I shouldn't even write this review--I don't want everyone to learn about this place.  For locals, it's a little jewel, hidden in the hills, minutes from home, and the food is always tasty and well prepared.  The service is excellent.  This is our go-to place for great dining, with terrific ambience.  Where else can you go for excellent venison, served in an old stage stop from the 1800s?"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern is everything you never knew you wanted. 

Came here on a warm Sunday, led by a friend who lives In SB locally. She said it was delicious Tri Tip hidden in the mountains. I was confused and intrigued! Parked a little bit up the hill and hiked down to the Tavern. When you turn the corner there are dozens of people hanging outside, Sons of Anarchy, but much nicer! There was a shack that served as a bar where you order your meal ticket, and around the building was the grill. The holy grail. the tri tip sandwiches! 

It may be difficult to find seating, but we got incredibly lucky with some picnic benches in the back. Beer in hand, onion rings on deck, I was ready to dive in. They offer a few sauces: bbq, a horseradishy deli mustard, and an au jus. The bread was basic, but soft enough to soak with au jus. The tri tip was simply seasoned, and perfectly tender. The onion rings were great too! The onions bit off with every bite (no awkward just-batter moments). 

CST was everything you never knew you wanted. Rustic, ""hidden,"" simple. peaceful."

They've got great BBQ tri-tip sandwiches, live music, along with cold beer. The line can be long, but the music makes it worth the wait."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Love this place . Me and my boyfriend come out here on sundays and we get the tri tip sandwich. .. I don't really eat much BBQ but when I do I choose to come here .. it is to die for !!! I also love the atmosphere makes you feel like you are out camping

Will come back again."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Tourist trap alert (they caught us!). The best thing about cold springs tavern is the neat old buildings and authenticism oozing from this place. Stop and have a beer, take a look around, and then keep driving, because it's all down hill from there. 

We stopped in and decided to have lunch. Again, the old historical tavern is awesome and well worth the price of admission (a beer). The food and service was terrible. My wife and I had the buffalo burger and it was burnt to a crisp. I mean how do you f up a buffalo burger?! Thank God I had an Old Rasputin Stout beer (props for that), otherwise I would have sent the burger back.

The service was laughable. I'm pretty sure our waiter was drunk or high. We split the bill between our group and he came back at least 8-9 times with basic questions such as, ""who had the coke? Who had the beer? Have you ordered yet?"" (after we finished eating). I went out back to look at the old jail and all the cooks were texting on their phones instead of watching the bbq. No wonder our burgers were burnt.

It's a shame such a neat place is being milked by its owners. I would give it one star but the historical factor (+1 star) and Old Rasputin (+1 star) saved their burnt bacon."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Last weekend, John and the crew at Cold Spring Tavern organized and catered my daughter's wedding reception. The event was a success on all levels. From our first conversations in November, John was our guide to creating a memorable occasion for the bride and groom, as well as a unique experience for all attendees.

John arranged for the tables, linens, silverware, dishes, food and beverages. We had wines from Brander Winery, beers from Telegraph Brewery and Firestone, and Cold Spring's legendary tri-tip, as well as sea bass. Our guests ranged in age from my 91 year old father to 5 week old baby Claire. We also had a shuttle from Santa Barbara and Goleta locations, arranged through Santa Barbara Airbus which saved us the angst of having our guests drive down the hill after the party.


I want to thank Wayne for keeping the tavern as it has been since my first visit in the 1970s. I want to thank John for all his assistance and for planning skills.  The staff were gracious and smiled a lot. I recommend the tavern for your special event."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A great weekend spot for a lunch or beer in a truly rustic historical setting, fun people watching (popular with the motorcycle crowd). First visit was on a weekend, and there was a good bluegrass band playing. Choose their outdoor barbecue, or the woodsy rustic sit down restaurant inside.  Parking can be a tad challenging and not recommended for those who get car sick on windy roads! A bonus for bridge enthusiasts is the historic site span bridge 1/2 mile from the tavern. Went there twice within a few months and enjoyed both visits, and would go back, mostly for the atmosphere, as the food is good 'honest' American food, but not five star."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I've been here twice and was so impressed both times. Such a wonderful energy here with wonderful food! I'll definitely be back.

You can enjoy live country music plus  tasty wine and beer! 
We had a delicious dinner there. That was so delicious. Food and service were outstanding!
Will be back definitely!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Foodies take heart, this place has tri-tip at its best.  And the ribs, dang!  My gf and I were in paradise.  Everything was great.  The bread, the butter, I mean I was just amazed at the high quality throughout.  I have spent twice as much for lesser quality. The tri tip sandwich could easily fetch more money it was that good.  The portions were generous.


Fellas just go!  If you are traveling via Lake Cachuma 154 you have to stop here at least once.

Don't be there regularly as I want some chance to go there again real soon!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Hidden gem! Best tri-tip sandwich you will ever eat. I can't vouch for the restaurant, as we always just go have a drink from the bar and get a ticket for a sandwich. If you are willing to venture off the beaten path a bit, this place is totally worth a stop. Up in the mountains and back in time. They usually have a band playing on the weekend afternoons and an eclectic mix of people. Delicious tri-tip served on a huge toasted roll. Top with a barbeque sauce, horseradish based sauce, or a salsa style topping. . you just can't go wrong. Bring a jacket, can be cooler."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Every time we come to SB we have to come here! It's a beautiful drive up the mountain, parking can be a bit of a challenge. Saturday's, Get the tri tip sandwich and 24 oz beer on tap.  Enjoy the outdoors at a picnic table and listen to the live music! Music is usually folk but has some pop covers. Love the atmosphere here, it's always a good time and no cell phone service to distract from conversation with friends, but hopefully enough to Lyft back down!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Called 45 minutes in advance from the road to see if there was still room before they close at 3. They said yes sure as long as you get here before 3 we will seat you and then promptly hung up on us. We arrived at 2:45 and the extremely rude waiter told us 'there is absolutely no chance you're gona get a table, come back later.' They are open from 5-8. Came back at 7 and had the same thing happen. Rude wait staff, not worth the trip, find somewhere else to eat."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Yep, Five Stars -- for the venison sausage alone!

The three of us came here for dinner during our wine tasting trip to Santa Barbara/ Santa Ynez and we're glad we did.  The food was amazing!  If you watch the Food Network, you might get the wrong impression and think this more of a biker's BBQ place.  It is, and it's fun just for that, but you would be missing all the other wonderful food they prepare and serve!

If you have never been to Cold Spring Tavern, it is a group of some very old buildings.  The restaurant is somewhat hard to find.  Hopefully you're NAV system is up to date!  You might think you're lost when you make a sharp turn down a old country road dropping 100 feet or so before getting to the restaurant.  I would suggest getting there early since parking can be a problem.

As one other Yelpers noted, it was originally a stage coach stop that was built in 1886.   So, if you are looking for a fancy Three Star Michelin dinning experience, I would tell you to leave your preconceive notions at home.  The food is probably close to that Michelin rating, it's that good!  But, the restaurant is very rustic, and I mean that in the best possible way.


We started with the Venison sausage filled mushrooms for $9.50 and the Appetizers for two for $15.50.  As I noted above, it was delicious!

For dinner we ordered and shared the boneless Half Chicken for $21.50, charbroiled Pork Chop $24.00 and the NY Strip for $23.50.  WOW!  Some of the best food we ever had!

We finished what we could and asked for a dogie bag.  We skipped the dessert and opted instead for a night cap at the Hitching Post.  The tab came to $145 or so and we felt it was well worth it!

Great, great evening!

Enjoy!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is absolutely perfect. The tri-tip was spot on, everyone was friendly, the live music was amazing. There are a lot of nice bikers, they don't take away from it being a family friendly spot. Keep in mind it's off the beaten path, parking was easy enough for us (side of the road), with a short walk up. 
 Everyone we spoke to (working or visiting) had a huge smile on their face. 
We can't wait to visit again."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Good food decent service but awesome location. If ur on vacation check this place out well worth it. feels like ur back in the 1900s. Very cool stuff
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The look and feel of this one time stage coach stop in the middle of nowhere will travel you back in time 135 years to California's Old West even though you're  just a 13 mile/20 minute drive from downtown Santa Barbara.

First the food:
BarBQ Venison Sausage Burger available at lunch... outstanding.
Tri-Tip Sandwich... too much BBQ sauce, not enough ""char-b-q""  flavor in the beef itself for my tastes.
Onion Rings... fresh, crisp, flavorful... huge portion... the best I've had in a long time.
Sandwiches include fries, potato salad, soup, or green salad.

Next time I'd like to taste the Charbroiled Venison Steak sandwich or go for dinner for Sauteed Medallions of Rabbit, Grilled Venison Tenderloin, Stuffed Pheasant, Chabroiled Elk Steak or Wild Boar Tenderloin.

The tavern is located on the side of a twisting tree lined road.  The tavern itself was built in 1873 and looks it.  You step into the first small dining room, can make your way through it to the large main dining room or keep going to another small dining room in the back.
Tables are also available (without service) out front outside where you can go inside and order from the restaurant and bus your own food when its ready to your table under the trees.

On weekend afternoons there's live music.

It's a fun excursion from Santa Barbara... still serving great food after all these years."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We had heard about this place through various networks of friends, and finally, on the way to Solvang via the back route, we made a detour to give their breakfast a try. It was beyond amazing. We had the Wild Game Omelet, the Venison sausage patties, the biscuits and gravy, and the molasses bread. The Wild Game Omelet was a bit too much in terms of the ingredients, but it was fresh and homemade and didn't have any of that funky ""gamey""ness. The venison sausage was a bit dried out, but it was indeed flavorful. The whole wheat molasses bread was a bit unique, but it was thick and warm. The biscuits and gravy... probably the coup de grâce to this immense and rich meal... was by far the underdog highlight. Never have I had such a savory sausage gravy, it was even better than my dad used to make (sorry Pops), and the biscuits were light and flaky. We even stopped ourselves from over gorging, so that we could take the remaining biscuit and gravy with us. Reheating tip, don't use full power and the water/milk/fat ratios won't get that weird separation. We can't wait to go back again, and heck, it was so good, I would probably head out of town super early to drive the distance for breakfast alone."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a really cool place to stop, right outside if Santa Barbara as you cross the hills on 154 headed for the Santa Ynez winery region.  They were serving HUGE tri tip beef sandwiches.  The draft beers were awesome.  We especially enjoyed the Island Blonde, a Kolsch type beer.  On the weekends, they have live music.  The place was packed, with people of all types and ages."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Interesting Historical Place to Visit - Be Cautious of the Food!  It was worth the trip to visit these historical buildings; however, we were expecting great food based on their Web site.  The salad makings were not fresh - limp and they brag about their famous Cold Spring Chili Burger - this was nothing to write home about.  The friends with us had different dishes and they, too , were disappointed.  They had the fireplaces going and it was very smokey in there.  You have to go outside to use the restaurant which is located in another building and being the location is in the bottom of a canyon, it is not convenient.  They do have a bar which we didn't use due to being lunch; however, if you have a few drinks and then try to drive out of there on the rough 2-lane road, good luck."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I was very eager to check this place out, only to realize that the service there was really ""shitty!"" When i  first entered this establishment, i felt very unwelcomed. I stood there for around 15 minutes before one of the servers noticed me. I wasnt even offered a menu to see what was offered."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"So it seems most of the discrepancy here among reviews are between people going to the restaurant looking for a romantic time, and people who go for the Sunday Tri Tip Sandwiches.

Let me save you the time spent reading the other reviews and tell you just go on Sundays and you'll have a great time.  The only trick is to know what you're doing!  

I'll break it down for you:

- Go for lunch.  We got there around 3:30, but by the time we were leaving around 5, the bikers had all left and the only people remaining were the preppy Santa Barbara locals/college students and tourists.  Part of the fun is hanging with the bikers and the great music.  They absolutely make the atmosphere worth going for.  You want to fit in with the bikers, so don't go wearing your fancy sparkle sandals and big earrings.  It's super dusty, so just go casual and you won't worry once about what you're wearing.  

- Once you start seeing cars, park on the street.  Park where you're able and don't try to force your car into a spot, because you'll look silly when your tires start spinning because you parked your little city car over a ledge just because you wanted to park closer.

- Go to the bar, which is the building on the far left.  Do not go to any other building.  Stand in line and when it's your turn, order a Tri Tip Sandwich and your beer of choice.  Do it quickly and with a smile and they'll smile back.  Pay, get ticket for sandwich.

- Walk around to the center of the property and up towards a little hill to where you'll see a tent and a very large gentleman with a very large knife.  This man will not smile.  He may joke, but he won't smile.  I went up, unsure of what to say, and asked for one sandwich, please.  He said they were on break and since he wasn't smiling I assumed he was telling the truth and I cheerfully replied ""oh! okay!   When should I come back?""  He then started carving off some meat for my sandwich, so I quickly figured out that he was just kidding around.  I later saw a preppy frat boy trying to start some friendly conversation with the guy--the poor boy was so eager for recognition as a ""regular"", with a puppy dog smile, saying how much he loved the sandwiches and I'll see you next week.  The large meat cutter guy stared at him with a blank face, except for when he was looking down at the meat with a blank face.  Poor frat guy!

- Take your sandwich (there are no plates) to the sauce station a few feet back from the meat station.  If you have a friend with you, leave your beer with them on the sauce station so you can scurry back to the meat station to drizzle a little hot au jus on the bun (impossible to do while you're holding a beer).  Back to the sauce station.  I know a lot of people love putting the salsa on top, but I went for slathering on both the Apple Horseradish Sauce (not so horseradishy, but there was whole grain mustard in it, too) and BBQ Sauce.

- Find a place to sit with your beer and your sandwich and DIG IN.  You will be in meat & beer paradise.  The sun will be shining, the forest cool yet warm at the same time, the occasional roar of the motorcyclists, the band playing not too loudly, just enough for great atmosphere.  I don't remember seeing napkins anywhere, so we used a little spigot to rinse our fingers.  The best part of the sandwich, in my opinion, was the buttery toasty bun.  It was absolutely perfect for the sandwich.  I wish my meat was a bit warmer, but we got the tale end of the cut and, really, I can't complain.  If you're going specifically to try the sandwich, you're missing out and may even be disappointed--you really need to be coming here for the sandwich AND the atmosphere.

Overall, thanks, CST, for a great Sunday afternoon, even though it's a 2+ hour drive from Santa Monica!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What can be said about cold springs that hasn't already been said by the almost hundreds who have already reviewed it. 
The food is great, the ambiance is transcendent, the service is stellar. 
I can't say enough good things about the restaurant. 
If there were a down side to cold springs tavern, I would say that it is the super loud, live, cock rock 70's band... and having to wade through the mini sturgis like scene of bikers, just to get a bite to eat. 
But hey... to each his own, right?"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"CST is an absolute delight! It is nestled in the woods, away from all the hustle and bustle and offers an enchanting, serene and peaceful environment along with all it's charm and history.  We stopped by on a Sunday morning and enjoyed a wonderful breakfast. I enjoyed the whole wheat french toast with molasses bread and was pleasantly pleased.  I will return and make this a traditional stop whenever in the Santa Barbara area."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Excellent. Very romantic & cozy setting. If this place doesn't get you out of the dog house with the wife. Then you better get a good lawer. Wild game meals. Lamb and Venison from New Zealand. Just check it out!!!

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Really enjoyed our visit and lunch. Very interesting ""foodie-esque"" feel to a traditional menu, but not over the top. Was VERY happy with the beer selection! We timed our arrival perfectly; both parking lots full and cars parked along the road when we were leaving. Staff was friendly and helpful. World famous chili was EXACTLY how chili should taste...no fanciness, just really good! Will recommend and revisit."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Today my Husband and I wanted to try out a restaurant called Cold Spring Tavern in Santa Barbara. I gotta say that was the worst service ever!!! We sat down got our order taken and drinks. None of the servers bothered to ask if we wanted a refill! The server said they had computer issues after 30 minutes of waiting and said it would be right out another 30 minutes so in total took an hour . The only thing is everyone around us got their food and had already finished by the time we got ours. I liked the way the restaurant looked but will never waste my money at that place again. I suggest no one attend unless you want to wait an hour and have bad service. It seemed that since we weren't ""white"" we would get served las"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"9am I'm awoken by a knock on my front door.  I open it and standing there was a man with a camera and a women holding a giant oversized Wilco ticket and a life-size cardboard cut-out of some FYT (Fine Young Thang.) She began a tirade about it being my lucky day and congratulated me on my winning, my head was in a whirlwind so much of what she said made no sense but eventually I was able to ascertain the I had hit the Craigslist Personals jackpot and my prize was a day in Santa Barbara seeing Wilco accompanied by the FYT in the cut-out.  HOT DAMN!

1pm the following day my mystery date shows up parked outside.  I grab my bag run down to the vehicle and peer into the car window.  I swallowed my gum.  Sitting in the driver's seat was the kind of girl that when you leave her for just one moment to get up to go to the bathroom invariably some Romeo in black jeans tries to move in and it's no myth.  I would have to hold it in for the entire day.

Flash forward to windy road in Santa Barbara, interior car, 

Me: So ahhh... where we going.

Her: I know a little place

Me: Ummm all right.

We drive past a sign that indicates we are entering the Los Padres national forest, Land of Many Uses.  Hang a left before a bridge and decline down a road, past a couple dozen cars and choppers to a rustic looking outpost somewhere between a John Ford film and the Bear Country Jamboree at Disneyland.  Outside an amalgamation of Hard Drinking Local 151: bikers, old heads, yuppies and young bucks grooving to a bluesy folksy country quartet kicking out the jams.  One member is banging out percussion on a Charles Shaw box.  

Mystery dates been here before, she gives me the skinny, points me in the right direction, smacks me on the ass and sends me on my way.  Order of the day is a couple of BBQed Tri-tip sammies on toasted buns and some Miller Lite to wash it down.  The sammies are busting out at the seams with smokey beef, fixin's are a spicy BBQ sauce, a Horsy sauce with grainy mustard and pico de gallo.  You apply your own in the amount and proportions you see fit.  

Maybe it was the company, or the canyon air, or the guy playing the Charles Shaw box, maybe it was the hunger coupled with the Miller Lite, maybe it was just the meat but that was the best God damn tri-tip sammie I have ever had.  Oh boy, if the genders were reversed and I was the women and she the man, she'd so be getting laid at the end of this day, maybe even a BJ in the middle.  But gender politics as they stand a dude putting out on the first date is nothing nobody's hurting for nor going to brag about to their friends.    

And still there is the whole day ahead of me.  Ah yes, today will be a good day."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Came here for the first time last Wednesday.

The drive up there was really scary. Dark, canyon, mountainous drive. Parking is horrible. You park as close as you can to the edge of the mountain so you won't get hit by on coming traffic.

I was freezing in there. There was no heat in the place. I had a hard time eating it was so cold. Did not feel comfortable in the place.

Did not like the new york strip at all. I ordered it medium rare, and it was on the well done side, with just a hint of pink. It tasted burnt and no flavor what so ever The meat was not tender.

The service was slow.

The red clam chowder was horrible. It was really runny and didn't taste good. 

I would NEVER come back here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Totally Awesome!! We stayed at Bacara and drove up to the tavern for a late lunch on a Wednesday. Hardly anyone there. We had the dining room practically to ourselves. The food was excellent. We went with the microbrew and it was great. I had a salad as there was not much vegetarian choices but my companion had the French dip and said it was very good. It is unique, historic and a cool experience."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"On your way back to Santa Barbara from the Santa Ynez Valley after a day of  wine connoisseuring (or just drinkin')?

There is no more romantic destination than the old Cold Spring Tavern.  Up the San Marcos Pass, nestled in the hills, this folksy restaurant looks like a a good ol' Tennessee shed, but what you get is a beautifully rustic setting with a fireplace and antler-festooned walls and simple but good American fare, including seafood, but specializing in game (such as the Elk Tenderloin that we enjoyed when we were there).

The wine list has a good selection at reasonable prices and food prices should be in the mid to upper $20's for mains.  Expect to spend about $50pp w/tip.

At the end of the day, the food was fine, but it's all about the setting.  Fun for a small group and romantic for a couple...definitely worth a try!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Lunch on Saturday in restaurant was perfect! Awesome bar-b-que beef sandwich n fresh salad. Loved all the cool motorcycles, nice weather, n handmade jewelry shop! My history loving travelers can't wait to go back!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,They are super busy on the weekend but it is worth the wait. The food is excellent and the folks working had a great attitude. The structure is old so there's a lot of uneven floors and old furniture but the surrounding of the woods makes up for it. Lots of great food and rich in history.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Great tri tip sandwiches and onion rings plus great beer and wonderful people watching. Go on the weekend when the bikers are there!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I try to stop in at Cold Spring Tavern anytime I am in the area.  I recommend it to anyone who is driving through Santa Barbara.  The drive is pretty but the roads can be a bit windy. It's only about 20 minutes away from Santa Barbra.  There is so much history to this little old tavern.  It was established in 1865 as an old Stagecoach stop so it's very fun to visit and see how things were back then since it's been well preserved.  There is a tiny museum where you can purchase souvenirs, a bar and a small restaurant.  The food is very good.  I have had soup and wine at the bar while sitting at the fire when it was raining out and I have also been on a Sunday for the tri-tip sandwiches and beer. Sundays are so much fun because there is a very eclectic crowd sometimes lots of bikers and good people watching.  There is usually live music and a BBQ that serves tri-tip sandwiches for about $10.00 but it comes with fries.  People are friendly and everyone seems to always be having a good time.  I would say this is a must do on a Sunday for lunch."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"After reading reviews and seeing this place on the Food Network, I  really wanted to like this  place, but everything was lacking.  We went on a Monday for lunch and place was pretty empty only 2 other tables occupied. We moved tables twice, as there was a bad odor we tried to get away from.   Our server appeared bored and after taking our order only came by our table once to drop off our food.  We had to ask another server for drink refills and for our bill.  Had the  BBQ beef sandwich which was Only ok, nothing special.   My husband had the venison sausage burger which he said was ok, but nothing to brag about.  I  understand that the buildings are historic, and therefore rustic, but, that is no excuse for dirty tables and abundance of flies in the dining area. Will not be going again."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a cool little joint. After a day of sailing our buddy took us up here, as on Sunday they have live music and their infamous tri tip sandwich. 

It's a very windy journey into the SB mountains to find this, but worth the drive. Tons of local MC were there and people from all walks of life. It's a couple old buildings in the side of hill. The tunes were some good rock and rumour was the sandwich was delicious. 

Set up was a tad interesting. Huge line to get a drink/ticket for the sandwich, which didn't actually take that long. And it was good how he sandwiches we're served, you got a ticket, walked around the building and there was two gentlemen, one cooking the meet and one cutting and assembling the sandwiches. 

Lots of character, only downfall would be the side of the road that it's on. You get no afternoon sun."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Rustic, Historic, and hidden in the beautiful mountains of Santa Barbara away from absolutely everything! I've come at night and I wish I could come earlier so I could check out all the historic little buildings around it as well as the breath-taking scenery. 

Everyday there is a different special of the day and I've had the pleasure of trying their wild boar ribs which were so smokey with a touch of gamey taste and tender and rare where it needs to be. I'm very adventurous and the more uncommon the dish, the more likely I am to try it all! The venison is always good, the thing that will be blow your mind to smithereens is how juicy and tender it is! Yes, it is also a little gamey but the tenderness just melts in your mouth so much that you wish it could just stay there forever and ever. The rabbit medallions are sauteed in a mushroom and onion cream sauce and taste just like chicken, so it didn't wow me as much as the venison or boar did. The appetizer platter has a great mini variety of all their appetizers such as the creamy shrimp (HUGE PRAWNS), venison sausages, artichoke dip, and a few other things that I can't remember at the moment. The creamy shrimp can be ordered as a dinner sized dish which comes in pasta and cream sauce with ginormous succulent prawns. 

Each meal comes with a soup or salad, and I always opt for the soup since it changes up everytime. The tomato basil soup was unlike any other tomato basil soup I've ever had, it was so creamy and so flavorful with a hint of smokeyness to it as well! Another time I had the carrot ginger soup. But the salad is pretty good as well, try their homemade vinagrette, or their Hidden Valley Ranch!

Question: On the menu, it says that their own original Hidden Valley Ranch is served...so does that mean the area that the Hidden Valley Ranch actually comes from this hidden spot in the mountains?! Does anyone know?!?! 

If you are visiting Santa Barbara and want to see something that contains the true essence of what Santa Barbara is, this Stage Coach stop will give you some of its history, its flavor, and its beauty!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cat Cora wasn't kidding when she claimed that this was the best BBQ she ever ate. I was lucky enough to venture out to Cold Spring Tavern on the way back from Pismo Beach and boy was I glad that we decided to make a pitstop here. 

It's definitely off the beaten path and even though we were armed with google maps and nav, there were a few times where we questioned if we were heading in the right direction because it was so far off the normal road. But once the tavern came in sight, it looked like an oasis. The empty dirt road opened up to a energetic gathering of a hodge-podge of people hanging out in front of the tavern on picnic style benches listening to a live folk band right along side a creek. It was quite the sight especially seeing such a diverse gathering of people from bikers to families with kids, harley davidsons along with toyota priuses and mercedes benzes. It was a beautiful sight indeed and I had my own ""It's a Small World"" happy moment when I saw it for the first time. 

Now on to the reason we came in the first place. The BBQ Beef sandwich. It deserves a pause here in recognition of how marvelous this sandwich is. How great can a BBQ beef sandwich really be? That was my exact question as I anticipated my first bite. It blew away any hesitation and doubt that I had in mind as soon as I took my first bite. The beef was so tender and juicy. Perfectly accompanied by the most amazing apple horseradish sauce and BBQ sauce. It was the perfect amount of tangy and sweet once the horseradish and BBQ sauce blended together. The salsa was also a good addition for those wanting some heat and fresh tomatoes to their sandwich. It was a great salsa and I was actually quite surprised by how spicy it was (in a good way). Even though the salsa was great, the combination of just the horseradish and BBQ sauce with the meat was amazing on its own. I'd probably get the salsa on the side and just add it to the bite where I'm feeling like I need a little more heat. The bun also stayed perfectly intact as I devoured my sandwich and held up to all of the meat and sauce. The sandwich was absolute perfection. Thank you Cat Cora for sharing this most amazing establishment which I would never have found on my own."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Wow ... can there be six stars? Probably one of the best and coolest restaurants I've ever been to. Food is great atmosphere matches.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"OMG!!!! The food alone is SO WORTH IT!
Then there is the ambiance! I wish I could give it 10 out of 5 stars!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Had the tri-tip sandwich. Salsa was AMAZING!!! I've had better homemade barbecue sauce but it was still good. Love the toasted bread the sandwich comes on. Meat tasted great. Only advice is try to sit inside or order to go and don't sit outside because there are a lot of insects, mosquitoes and bugs everywhere. Inside is cozy and cute."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Our camping neighbor recommended this place when he saw our Harley in the toy hauler whilst staying at Emma Wood Campground. On a Sunday afternoon we headed up the 154 to Solvang and stopped in on  the way back! Wow! Coolest atmosphere ever. Tucked away in the woods, full of bikes and character for days. I was in heaven! Cold drinks, great music and the tri-tip sandwiches were to die for! Definetely a must see place!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A unique experience. The nice long drive up the windy mountain road, the parking lot of Harley's and the outdoor grills make this a fun outing. 

The tri-tip is okay, not super flavorful or moist on its own. That's where the amazing sauces come in. Scoop a bit of Au jus onto your sandwich by the grill and then load it up with horseradish sauce, BBQ sauce or salsa--or all three! 

The horseradish was my favorite. Tangy and sweet! I also really liked the green onions in the salsa. Very springy and fresh. 

The sauces and the setting make this meal."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Ok, so it's really 3.5 stars - the extra 1/2 star for its ambience.  Sure it's quaint and unique, but by no means stellar food.  First off, I used to live in Dallas for 4 years.

I got the ribs - tasty, but not scrumptious.  The BBQ beef sandwich was I admittedly juicy, but there's that complete integration of meat and sauce that wasn't there.  For me, it was more memorable b/c of the bread.  I had expected the plain 'old el cheapo bun, so kudos to the good bread selection.

Bottomline: worth a trip, but not a habit."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cozy, rustic, love the ambiance and history, and their various hearty meats, especially the venison sausage burgers.  Note - I am not a big meat eater, but this is an excellent exception."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Amazing place to visit all throughout the year. This place is a great getaway place to visit for a day. It's beautiful and their food...especially the tri-tip tortas. It's a great stress reliever I recommend to everyone. Take the family out or a group of friends. Highly recommended.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Oh OH OH!! this place was a great suggestion by a CS friend and my road trip partners and I don't regret the detour just to stop and have lunch here, while enjoying the music. 

If you are vegetarian...too bad! You'll miss the trip-tip sandwich!! Even the food network had to stop here!. And the place is just gorgeous! seems like you are in a paralell world. You'll have to struggle a little bit for a parking space, but other than that...it is worthy!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Waiter was rude.  He shrugged as he kicked us out saying we should have got there before 3pm to order food because the kitchen is closed.   It was 3:05pm!!!  Yep,  he just wanted to sell booze, do less work, and get more tips."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"In the mountains high above Santa Barbara, in what seems like the middle of nowhere, is a magical place that serves great food and drinks. An old stage coach stop from the late 1800's is the setting of this magical place. My friends and I were there on a Friday afternoon and there were people waiting outside for a table. Our reservations were for 1:30 pm and it was still croso if possible, I would recommend making reservations. The French dip, tri-tip sandwich, and ribs with onion rings on the side were what my friends ordered. The onion rings looked fabulous and my friends confirmed they were as were the sandwiches and ribs. I had the roasted vegetable salad and it was delicious. We had Cold Spring Tavern's bacon and asparagus quiche for breakfast that morning and it was the best quiche I had ever had. Our server that day was very personable and provided excellent service. My previous visit to the Cold Spring Tavern was about 23 years ago and the food was great then, so I am pretty confident the great quality is consistent."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a great little historic gem. Well worth the trip. They are a bit pricey ($25-50 a meal), but there isn't any other restaurants around. They are also pet friendly (but not on Sunday). 

I got the cold spring stuffed  chicken with salad. Very filling and pretty tasty. My sister got the buffalo burger and she enjoyed it as well. They also have a great wine selection, and some local beers. 

Inside is small and cozy. I sat outside with my dog on a picnic table. Next door to the restaurant is a bar area with live music/singing."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is nestled in the mountains lol 

I typically hate taking San Marcos Pass but the drive is SO WORTH IT when it comes to the destination :)


New York Steak once again for me and the MOST DELICIOUS GARLIC MASHED YOU WILL EVER HAVE. SWEAR BY IT!!!! 

Friendly staff

GREAT FOOD/ NICE PORTIONS

It's definitely a woodsy tavern atmosphere 

One of my Grandparent's clients, every year they have an annual party and I wish they would invite me so I could dine here for free LOL 


Definitely a dinner worth having outside of town! 

ENJOY"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Most favorite bar/restaurant ever. Super cool history, location, and vibe. Disappointed with this visit though. Dinners of pork chops, chicken, and steak were all very dry (over cooked or sat way to long under heat lamp). Service was terrible. One example was beer order when food was finally delivered, only to see it after I finished my meal. The experience was a real disappointment, but the place is a must visit--at least once."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Absolutely a must go to if you are in the Santa Barbara area. This establishment has been operating for over 122 years and you can feel the history here. 

One thing I like to mention as it is not mentioned in any of the reviews is the set up. 

This place can sometimes be a little overwhelming especially if you are here on a weekend. This advice really applies most to Saturday and Sunday (also they have live music starting around 1 pm on the weekends) 

Parking is along the road and there is no lot really. Once you start to see cars parked along Stagecoach Road you know you are approaching. 

There is parking along the road before and after you pass the establishment just look for the closest spot. If you are on a motorcycle they do have a small lot. 

When you walk up it can seem very busy. All the outside tables and seating by the road are on a first come basis. If you are eating outside you have to order in the bar, where they will give you a ticket to wait in another small line for Tri Tip Sanwiches and Onion Rings (which are both amazing!!). 

You can choose to go that route...

OR YOU CAN sit inside at the tavern which is the main building located at the center by the road. They have about 20 tables inside and that is on a seating basis with a full menu. 

For me that is the way to go. Of course Onion Rings are a must. I love the BBQ Ribs and you can also order the Tri Tip inside. I have not had the Chili yet but I hear it's a staple. They have a full bar and the prices for both food and drink are very fair. Food is great and the experience is even greater. I cannot recommend more!!

A++"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"While the atmosphere and setting are very nice, the lunch menu was only so-so. My tritip sandwich was alright, but my friends who ordered the chili and hamburger were not impressed. The drive up, the scenic location and building made it worth it for me though. There is also a nice hiking trail nearby."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I've been meaning to write my review since my wedding in October.

I absolutely love this place! My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner here and the staff was more than accommodating. When we went for a date night prior to booking, the event planner was so helpful and provided us with fantastic service! After the wedding,a group of us came by for the weekend BBQ and to celebrate with a few drinks!

Whether it's a romantic date night, a special event, or even a Saturday BBQ, this is the spot! Great food with an incredible atmosphere!

Don't pass this by and be sure to stop in when you're around! You won't regret it!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Loved the atmosphere. Parking can be a pain. The tri-tip sandwich was the reason we drove up from LA, and I don't regret it at all. Super meaty, salsa was super and a great spot for a nice summer afternoon."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Had a great dinner here on New Years Eve.  The place is an old rustic type building tucked away in the hills.  The setting is romantic with dim lights and a fireplace. 

We had the soup,  tri tip sandwich, and baby back ribs.  The food and service were great.  I highly recommend you check them out if you are in Santa Barbara or camping at Lake Cachuma."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a neat spot!  Too bad it is not a secret.  There were tons of people, cars and bikes were parked up and down the street pretty far.  The scenery was beautiful and the setting felt like a movie or something.  A band was playing and people were sitting in any available spot they could to enjoy the music and have a cold drink.  You can order tri tip sandwich fresh from the grill or order food inside the restaurant.  We got our beers and got a sandwich.  I am not usually a fan of tri tip but this one was actually wonderful, those guys know what they are doing.  I also ordered the chili sampler and all three chilies were awesome.  This whole place has such a great vibe and is a must stop if you are in the area."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Stopped off on the way to Solvang as I had previously researched this place and really wanted to fit it into our weekend getaway, despite not being hungry. Got there around 10:30 on a rainy Saturday. They were still serving breakfast till 11. I could see that they were setting up for their weekend BBQ, which you could smell from the road. My boyfriend and I decided to split something since we weren't hungry. We opted for two eggs with their homemade venison sausage. Venison sausage... OMG. So flavorful and delicious, not gamey at all. I definitely wanted more! I want to go back to try their venison burger and their famous tri tip sandwich. 

Decor is rustic. Walking in is like walking into the past, an old log tavern with a great big welcoming fireplace. There's all kind of pictures, animal heads and other appropriate decorations. Including the lamp on our table with some kind of animal skin as a lamp shade. Loved it! Very authentic. 

Warning. This is a five star place for me, but do not expect fine dining. This is authentic and rustic, it's about the atmosphere and the food. I will definitely be back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"First, we love the windy roads out and around Santa Barbara. 
Second when you pull down the grade of Stagecoach Rd, twisting to a shady spot off the road to park on the shoulder, your greeted by an awesome smell of smokey goodness.
The way the woodsmoke filters through the trees and hangs in the air invites any road traveler to one heck of a meal. The building, (yes there are buildings) offer a cozy bar, complete with motorcyclists/bikers and beer or wine. The next building is the restaurant  (though there is an outside service station with pits of fire cooking slabs of meat) 
The place its self is romantic and cozy. And its a landmark (read its history) which makes it cool and helps you appreciate what we take for granted everyday.
The food, yes now the food, is awesome. mouth watering and flavorful and yes we well be going back again! The menu, well everything on it looked good, surrounded by friends and a fire in the stone fireplace and cold beer, I could have stayed there all day. (Picture teh HBO series Deadwood, but much more friendlier) Everyone there was real friendly and enjoying themselves. They have live music almost every night 7 days a week, alittle bit country ole timey. Well worth the drive!!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"4 stars for the location and a pretty good tri-tip, thou i am not too big on tri. 
2 to 3 stars for service and UNfriendliness. Yes the people who work there do NOT act nice."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A favorite stop on our way to pick up our wines in Los Olivia and Santa Ynez. Great food, awesome atmosphere, great service, reasonable prices. You'll even enjoy the drive to get there."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This place has been a favorite because of the unique atmosphere, out-of-the-way location, and interesting menu.  Well, I'm afraid the owners (next generation, living in Ohio as I understand it) don't have their heart in it.  The place needs hands on management and fresh enthusiasm!!  Service was surprisingly poor--perhaps because our waiter had too many tables assigned to him.  The food was good, but not  as good as we remembered.

So, I guess we were disappointed..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is beautiful. For me, it hits all the right notes. Good food, well-priced, and wonderful ambiance.  The lunch prices were such a good deal. Averaged about ten bucks or less per person.

I had a cinnamon hot tea and Tri Tip sandwich. BBQ-y goodness. Crispy fries. SO good. All this right next to a lovely fireplace. And surrounded by more nature than I'm used to.

My boyfriend had a simple grilled chicken sandwich and fries. He thought it was' pretty standard' but the atmosphere made up for it. He probably would give this place a 4 as he is pickier than I am."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Excellent Tri-Tip Sandwich for $10.
It is the best.BBQ sandwich you will ever experience.
They serve Saturday and Sunday 11-3 pm, since it's dark now, they are doing it till 5pm.

Come enjoy the cook out and experience the a lot of the different tourist and locals come."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I like this place so much, my wife and I got married here!  Seriously.  There is absolutely no better place to spend a warm Sunday afternoon."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What fun this old stagecoach stop is that's over 100 years old. Rustic to the max with creaking floors and decor that could decorate the Silver Dollar Saloon in Tombstone, Arizona during Wyatt Earps reign, this restaurant is such a throw back to yester year it's almost like being at Frontierland at Disneyland. 

With a menu jam packed with game (literally) in which there is elk, venison, wild boar, buffalo, duck, pheasant, and so much more.
 I choose a buffalo cheeseburger and my wife had venison. Soup or salad and a potato come with your dinner.

Is the food here Le Bernardin (in New York) good, no. This place is not about that. It's about driving high into the Santa Barbara mountains where you actually see thousands of stars, park on a dirt road and the walk into a log cabin only to wish you were wearing jiggling spurs.  It's a welcomed mountain escape that lets your mind wander off into less serious matters taking place well below you at sea level."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"If you're making the trip from Santa Barbara to Solvang, you have to stop here!  It's nestled on the hillside about a mile off the highway.  They have good tri-tip sandwiches and a nice little bar.  There are picnic tables outside and some indoor seating as well.  This is an old Wells Fargo stagecoach stop and it looks the part.  It's very rustic.  An eclectic group of people were hanging out when we stopped by-bikers, tourists, and guys driving exotic cars.  It was a cool mix."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"worth coming here at least once for the beautiful historic setting but I would come for lunch and not dinner.  My wife liked her rabbit but afterward she was really thirsty and thought there must have been MSG in it. All the baked breads and rolls seemed to be baked there and fresh. Unfortunately what's in between is not as good as the bread.  my buffalo burger patty was way smaller than the bun and for $19 it should be the other way around (you do get a big salad or soup or chli too. Burger was way overcooked My kid's tri-tip was tough. service Service is cordial, polite but very slow"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This place is in an awesome location, sweet outdoor seating area live band on Sundays. I ogt the tri tip sandwich, meat was great but the bread. . . the bread was so dry and flakey part of the bread flaked off and hit me in the eye lol. The bread makes the sandwich in my opinion. This palce is worth the second chance but be leary the crusty bread peeps."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Definitely stop here and see for yourself. The ambience and property is amazing! 4 stars because my boyfriend's burger wasn't anything too crazy awesome. But! The venison stuffed mushrooms? Hearty and flavorful. The creamy Italian dressing on the salad? Light with a nice bright finish. The chili? Just ok in my opinion but addicting to where I just had to finish it. And the ribs? Some of the best I've ever had in my life. Meat was tight but tender, fell off the bone with a fork. The bbq sauce was spicy but sweet, the perfect combination of flavors. 

We will definitely be back :)"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,A nice tavern up the mountain area!  It's got that nostalgic tavern feel and a good spot for a romantic dinner I might add.  The food... excellent and has interesting items on the menu! I tried elk and that was a first for me!

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Tri-tip sandwiches to die for, great beer on tap and live music, all under the oak trees.. How could it get any better? It's a great place to grab a bite, close enough to Santa Barbara and dogs are allowed. Rustic, serene what a great spot to stop."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Loved it.

Staying in Santa Barbara for a few days, and I had been dying to try Cold Spring Tavern. My plan had been to go there for dinner on our arrival day (a Thursday), but we rolled into town later than expected, so I changed the plan to lunch the following day. Even though I had been looking forward to the dinner menu, I'm kind of glad it worked out that way, because the dark drive up into the mountains at night might have been a little unnerving. The property is just adorable. I would really love to return on a Sunday afternoon when they have their tri-tip cooking and live music. I'll bet that's just a blast. We had a short wait for our table (15 minutes or so), which was no problem because it gave us a chance to see all there was to see outside. It is very tiny inside, so I can see how reservations would be a good idea for dinner. Anyway, for lunch my group of three ladies decided to split an order of chili cheese fries as a starter. Yum. All good there. I ordered the famous tri-tip sandwich with a side salad (they claim to be where ranch dressing originated, so I had to do that, right?), and mom and aunt split a french dip (also made with tri-tip). We all agreed the meat was excellent. You know how sometimes with a tri-tip sandwich you take a bite and end up with an entire piece of meat dangling from your mouth? Not here. The meat was so tender it was like butter. Also, I'm not usually much of a horseradish person, but the apple horseradish they had was quite good. I cut it a bit with the provided BBQ sauce, and it was not too hot for my palate. (Though if you like hot horseradish, that could be disappointed.) Mom and aunt also approved of the potato salad. Service was good, atmosphere was rustic. And now that I've made the drive and know where I'm going, I think I would go for dinner. Heck, I'd go for breakfast. Hopefully I'll get back to Santa Barbara often enough to hit this spot several times."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Best TriTip sandwich I have ever had! Probably the best sandwich I have ever had! Moist and tender, fresh and hot! The only serve it on Saturday's and Sunday's until 5:30. Worth the drive!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is amazing.  There are few places I've been that are so literal in their time travel experience.  Somehow this place has managed to keep it's 1800's feel. We stopped with 2 young boys, and had the tri-tip sandwhich on a Sunday afternoon, it was a little out of our way from our trip, but well worth it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great food! Unique atmosphere! I love this place! It is not easy to find them, so make sure you google the directions in advance.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Enjoyed the windy road down here and the food did not disappoint! I had the tri tip and my husband had the rabbit. Sooo delicious! The ambiance was cool and you can tell where the original bar is. Great staff and overall experience!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Located 10 miles North of Santa Barbara off the San Marcos (154) pass, by far one of my favorite places. It's a drive straight up the mountain with a climb to 2,000 ft. The views of the Santa Ynez are breath taking! You need to pay close attention once you get to the top of the pass, you see a very small sign that reads, ""Cold Springs Tavern"". Then its a short distance to the left turn.

The Tavern is a old stage coach depot from the late 1800's, the stopping point for a fresh set of horses before descending to the Santa Barbara valley below. I believe everything inside is original floor, bar, jail cell, and no bathroom inside! Good news there is one outside!

The food served ranges from Santa Maria Oak grill steak, Venison, Salmon  all adding to a very unique dinning experience! Sunday's you will find one to two bands playing and parking is mostly limited to Harley's! To see 400 Hog's stretched along the roadside is very typical for Sunday afternoons."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Amazing location, great food, friendly service and friendly Patrons! What more could you ask for???"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great atmosphere!  I planned a birthday dinner for my boyfriend here and the food was OK, the staff lacked any sense of caring, but the indoor and outdoor decor was really neat.  Definitely worth checking out for the experience."

Our server recommended the chili sampler and that was to die for!  Even recommended a good imported light beer.  Came here a few months ago with some guy friends and they were so busy we could not even get a seat,  so we just sat at the bar and had some drinks by the fireplace. bartender was really cool.  This is a great place to take a date and score some points. This place is very romantic and I would definitely go out of my way to come here again. You guys are awesome!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Springs Tavern is indeed as good as it gets. Located in the heart of the Los Padres National Forrest, the wilderness surrounding provides the perfect backdrop, while the creek that runs alongside the tavern supplies the soothing soundtrack. 

We went there for an early lunch on a Sunday and it was already sprawling with an eclectic mix of people - from brawny biker-types with their leather clad companions to chill surfer-types looking for a post wave-trashing meal. We ordered the BBQ beef sandwich at the bar and received a frayed ticket, which we redeemed with the grill-master who's stationed between the bar and restaurant. All of our sandwich meat was prepared perfectly medium, and the grill-master made sure each sandwich got a healthy serving of his juicy masterpiece. The bread was perfectly toasted and the protein to carb ratio was just right. I proceeded to the sauce buckets where I was presented with a tough challenge: au jus, bbq sauce, apple horseradish sauce, or salsa... I decided the best thing to do was to load my sandwich up with all of the condiments since I wanted a taste of all the flavors. My only protection from the drippy sauces was the white butcher paper my sandwich was wrapped in. 

The majority of BBQ beef sandwiches I've had in my life have been tough and chewy so I'd be lying if I said I wasn't skeptical of all the rave reviews here on yelp. And then i took my first bite... which was absolute bliss. The meat was tender and juicy and the bread had nice body and texture, which stood up well with each successive bite. The condiments were bold and flavorful and the salsa added a little bit of heat to the sweet bbq sauce. As I licked my sauce drenched fingers and took a sip of my ""beer of the month,"" I realized that this might possibly be the best BBQ beef sandwich I've ever had in my life. 

The only thing missing from Cold Springs Tavern is a lodge. I'd love to stay there for days on end, take in the beautiful mountain scenery, and watch the diverse array of patrons enjoy their sandwiches just as much as I do."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I'd say the only downfall of this place is the inaccessability during heavy rains. 

The food...outstanding. The service...excellent. 

The prices are a tad high, but it's one of those few places that after spending 35-50 bucks per person, you don't feel terrible for being ripped off. 

I don't live in Santa Barbara anymore, but I plan to visit this place when I'm back in town. Save some buffalo for me!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Up the windy woodsy road, you find yourself off the beaten path and perhaps thinking you're lost. You eventually do come across a small cabin-like bar/restaurant that appeases your thirst for a cold beer. 
You kind of feel like you're in Frontierland at Disneyland with an old ranch/cowboy feel to it. It's really quite beautiful here. An abundance of trees to shade the outside, the stillness and quiet chirping of birds as you sip your beer. 
As you drive your way up to Santa Barbara/Solvang, remember to stop by here for a drink, to relax, and breathe in nature. I can't say anything about the food because all I wanted was a beer..haha...As usual."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,One of my favorite parts of living in Santa Barbara is going to Cold Spring Tavern. Being from the Hill Country of Texas it makes me feel like I'm at home. I wouldn't never know why it would receive less that 5 stars. The food and drinks are delicious and at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is even better!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great atmosphere and people.  Bring a jacket because it gets cold and windy in the mountains.  Windy roads and free dirt parking.  Come before 1 or it'll be tough to find a seat for the live band.

Came for the off the menu tri-tip sandwiches on Sunday.  Order at the bar, and bring your ticket around back.  Buttered hoagie piled with moist tri-tip carved in front of you.  Pass on the BBQ sauce and horseradish and go directly for the salsa.  Fried onion rings are well battered and fried to perfection."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cool place.  Lived in Santa Barbara for 4 years but never went until last year.....maybe because I was too busy studying???? NO!  I guess too focused on IV and Downtown.  Plus not really a college aged crowd.  30+ crowd....which I am now so I guess it is fitting that I never went before.  Food was good and it's a pretty cool area.  Downside, we went on what had to be the hottest day in Santa Barbara.....truely....in the 90's!  Sweating my ass off and in the restaurant it was damn HOT!!!!!  Shaded but no breeze at all and this place is forever old so of course no air.  Would love to go back when it isn't a million degrees out and really enjoy the atmosphere."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place is a really cool place to check out for a beer.  It's an old horse and carriage/wagon stop from the passed.  Definitely worth checking out if in the area.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I think I'm going to agree with Lucy Y. on the split personality of this place.  

I've been here a couple of times after it was introduced to me by an elderly family friend and while I've heard of the barbeque biker dude-esque atmosphere, I've never seen it.  Maybe I just never come at the right time.  

Anyhow, this place is tucked into the mountains and kind of hard to find if you don't have a GPS.  You turn onto this tiny road off of the highway and you keep driving down down down until you see this little old tavern on your left and then try to find parking near a lovely babbling creek.  I love the location.  :)

I've been here for breakfast and got the biscuits and gravy and some other small things that were okay, but not memorable.  

The second time we came around I got a seafood ravioli, which was absolutely phenomenal which is really what my 4 stars is based on.  Service is usually great and the food is typically fantastic, but I'm going to try to come again when I can find the tri-tip on the menu.  Maybe I'm blind."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"ok...once again being the food network groupie that i am, i came here on cat coras recommendation, ill keep it simple...she was right...SOOO GOOD...first time i did the restaurant and it was good, chili sampler was d'lish, went back on a sunday and did the whole sandwich thing...it really was as good as they all said, you gotta go ya'll youll love it..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,well what can i say the place speaks for it self great food excellent service
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"The food was ok, love me some tri-tip but I've had much better. Can't beat the location, feel and music so near to the city but so far away from it all"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place is legit! It's an old stagecoach stop from the early days. Everything on the menu is the real deal.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great location to get off the beaten path, enjoy a good BBQ, drink, & live music."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Love cold spring tavern. The history, the vibe, the location. Food is excellent, love the tri tip. Occasionally they have live music on the weekends which is super cool. Highly recommend this place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"One star is too much.  We had been going there for years with my father in law.  The food quality and the service had started to dwindle but we tried to ignore that.  On our visit this last time both were atrocious.  We ordered our food, got out salads and as soon as they were put down, the waitress came by with our entrees and stood there.  She was kindly instructed to take them away.  A few minutes later another waitress through them down on the table and said the kitchen was getting backed up as we were still eating our salads and appetizers.  The food was at least not cold.  My lamb was, for lack of a better word, gummy and bland as were my vegetables.  The ribs were tough and rubbery.  It was a miserable experience, definitely not cheap and one that we won't be repeating.  Cold Springs is WAY off the beaten path and hard to get to.  There are so many good restaurants in Santa Barbara.  Why waste your time at one where you have to go out of your way to get to it, the food tastes like it came from a hospital cafeteria, and the service is absolutely terrible."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"UPDATE:
I finally made it to the Tavern for the much sought-after tri-tip. It was really one incredible, delicious sandwich! However, I must note that it was really crazy/ridiculous what it took to get it. It was pretty busy in there, as it was a Saturday afternoon. After waiting like patrons do, a table apparently opened up, and the host was ready to seat us. OH! OOPS! Someone else decided to wander in and sit there. I envisioned figuring out which table it was and going over and flipping it over in a rage....but my better judgment won out, so as to not freak out a future in-law, and we politely waited for another table.

Once we were seated, I promptly ordered the tri-tip sandwich, and OOPS! again. The grill just outside the dining room is apparently, in some way, a separate thing, but we could keep our table only because the future in-law was ordering something from the regular menu. As it turns out, the process is that you purchase a ticket for the tri-tip sandwich and get it yourself from the grill master. That's fine and dandy, except that there is no sign anywhere saying how this all works, and that the freakin' sandwich tickets say ""Cold Spring Tavern"" on them. So, the grill right next to the building is a Cold Spring Tavern thing, but yet it's not. Apparently you can't sit inside if the only thing you eat is a tri-tip sandwich. The whole system just seemed a little wonky, but let me reiterate what is actually the most important thing here: the sandwich is incredible and delicious.


ORIGINAL POST:
This place has a great atmosphere and great BBQ, though we always miss the day(s) when they have the fresh-off-the-outdoor-grill tri tip sandwich... such a bummer in that regard, but we will be back!

Like reviewer Mark J., we also saw this place on Food Network, and it's a great place to stop and take a break on the drive north to wine country."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What is there to say, nice out of the way place with great history, great food (try the Chili Verde chili) had been 15 years since I was last there and still awesome. Just take a drive out there and ENJOY"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"You can't really beat this place for cozy atmosphere.  First time I came here was in 1980.  Came here again last weekend for breakfast and CST really hasn't changed too much since then.  Excellent food.  The best pork chop my wife has ever had.  Get here early for breakfast on Sat or Sun.  Three rooms, two fireplaces.  The smell of the air inside and out is woodsy, mountain air, wood smoky fresh!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"After driving through the dark hills and then arriving to live music and people outside, my girlfriend and I were excited to dine here for our date, but we were greeted with one of the rudest and indifferent waitresses I've ever had the displeasure of serving us. 

I wouldn't say this if I truly saw some merit in her service, being a former server myself, I think I am forgiving to the things servers have to put up with, but we hadn't even started and I felt like she just wanted to go home. 

She didn't welcome us at all and callously asked if we had reservation-- we said ""no,"" and even though only two tables were taken she hesitated. I was worried and I really wanted to eat here because of all I had heard and it was a special night for my girlfriend and me and I felt the waitress's reluctance very clearly. 

When we asked what was good on the menu, she rolled her eyes and sneered ""Everything"" as if we were offending her by even stepping into the restaurant and asking her for a recommendation. It was our first time.

To be fair, I appreciated the ambiance of interior and the history behind it, but I strongly feel that one of the most important aspects of the dining experience is service. As quoted from one of my favorite Japanese dramas, ""Bad service will make the greatest food taste horrible."" And that bad first taste lingered throughout our mediocre meal."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Go to this place for the amazing amazing decor and palatable history. Most people come for the tri-tip on the weekends - my husband and I came for dinner because this place has been officially named the most romantic dinner spot in Santa Barbara county. And it is. It's VERY low lit and the floor and walls and ceilings are ancient, which means it's dark. Everything's old. There are several rooms to pick from and if you happen to pick one of the smaller rooms it'll feel very homy and private but if there's anyone else in that room with you a private conversation will be impossible. 
I got the lamb shanks. They were good. My husband got the ribs. SO SO good!! Best ribs I've ever tried. Slightly crispy on outside and sooo so tender and soft inside. Make sure to get the garlic mash. I just assumed all mash was garlic and didn't order it specifically."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We had lunch here today. My husband loves tri tip and is a purist at heart. It has been two hours and he is still talking about the tri tip sandwiches we had. We bought two tickets inside from the very nice bartender and two sodas and proceeded to go ""out back"" to the BBQ grill where about ten or so perfect tri tips were waiting their turn in line to be grilled to perfection. Our grilled loaded up lightly buttered French rolls with so much meat that our mouths were watering right there. We greedily grabbed our plates from him. My husband added au jus but I went au natural. The first bite is the best and so was every bite after!  We are still smiling!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A hidden jam, love this place. It's a hell of a long ride for me but I do it. This is a truly magical place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,Well I made it there 8 a.m. on a Saturday just wanted coffee and biscuits and gravy they were great only extremely stingy on the gravy maybe it was too early for the good stuff but the taste was Heavenly and the biscuits were light as an Angels Halo
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,Great food and music but the bartender was evil... She clearly has some personality problems because she flipped out on me when I asked for a receipt :.. She is probably scamming the company... Stay away!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place has some real mystique.  A stop here is definitely an essential part of the old west tour of Santa Barbara county.  Definitely hit the old stagecoach museum in Santa Ynez first.  Once you can see how crazy unstable those old stagecoaches are + driving on that bumpy, curvy road to the tavern and you have a pretty good idea that this journey wasn't for the faint of heart or stomach. A little layover at the Cold Springs Tavern was a welcome relief from a rough ascent.

While I enjoyed my time here, it did not quite live up to the hype.  When you're a student at UCSB and don't really know where things are, it gets built up in your mind.  I remember the word expensive being attached.  Well, once there, it certainly seemed perfectly normal in the price range of a dinner.  Overall, it was OK.  I would return for another helping and to explore the rustic setting.  It's cool that this is still functioning after so many years.  I definitely want to go back and try a few different things.  The tri tip BBQ on Saturdays is reasonably priced for those on a budget."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is the best kept secret ever!!! I've been here on several occasions and every time I have an amazing meal! The first time I came here I had a full, sitdown meal inside, and it was lovely!!! I had rabbit. The second time, I came between lunch and dinner, so I had to get a roast beef sandwich from the grill and wow was that yummy. This place is really hard to get to but it is definitely a hidden treasurre!!!!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"These tri tip sandwiches during the summer are AMAZING! We definitely thought we were going the wrong way to find this place, but now I can't wait to come back! Not a hole in the wall, but a hole in the mountain! So quaint and rustic, it would be lovely for a romantic dinner too!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"MAJ Gonzalez told me she had one of the best tri-tip sandwiches she's ever had here. I was returning home from Ft. Hunter-Liggett so I decided to take the 101 back home and swing on by.

The tri-tip originally only got served on a Sunday which was the day I arrived but I saw a sign that said they were serving it both Sat and Sun now. I arrived at around 1300. The bar is where you order the sandwich, not the restaurant. Oh, it was also Easter weekend and raining a bit so the place was pretty empty. I was told there's normally a huge group of bikers and cars are lined down the road. 

I ordered a beer, the sandwich and the onion rings in beer batter. 

The sandwich is pretty spot on. I give a 3 1/2. Its bread was the weakest point. The cooks are a couple Mexican guys that grill this tri-tip outside and they seem pretty content. They also mix up the salsa and I think the other 2 sauces with the sandwich. These three things sit on a table next to the grill in huge jars. Next to the salsa, is the BBQ sauce and another white sauce with I'm guessing, horse radish. Honestly, none of it was that spicy to me at all. When I got my sandwich some other guys there asked the cooks which sauce they should use. I answered and said, ""Put all 3!"" and the cooks completely nodded their heads at this with approval. So use all 3 sauces! The meat is medium to medium-rare and it's good. Great seasoning on the meat and the meat's flavor really comes out. Oh and that's it. Meat, bread and your sauces. Nothing else is really needed. But again with the bread. Not sure if they make their own bread or not, I guessed not because this place is in the middle of no where so having bread delivered would be a pain. If they do make their own bread, it's just ok. If this sandwich was served with really great bread, it would completely rock. Maybe if the bread had been toasted just a bit on the grill it might have added to the taste. Actually this probably would have done it but I don't think you can ask for that. Maybe. Give it a try.

Wasn't too keen on the onion rings. I found the batter a little too thick though the onion rings themselves were pretty good. I think I'll give it a 2 1/2. 

So what wraps up the whole thing? In the bar they'll have a live band. Not sure if the same band plays every Sunday but the guys that were playing when I was there was only 3 guys. One on harmonica and vocals, another on guitar, and the third using brush drumsticks on a cardboard box! I've never seen the last and thought that was pretty cool. And they were pretty damn good. I overheard some guy in the bar say this band had playing here for 30 years or so. Yeah, so the atmosphere is very cool. I can definitely imagine the place really rocking when it's got 20-30 bikers in the joint."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is awesome! I like to make the drive from Summerland every now and then as it's a fun little getaway that feels like nothing in Santa Barbara. On the weekends, its got a huge biker gang and everyone sits outside eating. They have amazing tri-tip sandwiches and a good sit-down menu too. It's a beautiful drive and a fun thing to do!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Looking for a time warp back into the 1800's? This is your place.

DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED UPON ARRIVAL...I was the first time I pulled in. Off of some back road in the boonies you think ""Good Lord I'm not going to make it out alive"", but then you get inside and try some of the food and you are completely astounded! Their rabbit is to die for! They are a tad on the pricey side, but it is well worth the trek. If you can plan this around a trip into Solvang/Los Olivos, do it!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"If you're  traveling through the central coast and want to have a great time stop into Cold Spring Tavern on a late Sunday afternoon. You can hear the music a quarter of a mile away. As you walk up, its kind of a flashback of going to a raging party in college but in a really cool, historic place.

The bar room is not a place for kids, as they have security at the door. When you get in and hear the band, there are people dancing and rocking out. This place is lively. It's wall to wall people inside, which makes for a cool ambiance. I took my kids and wife for a few beers and they didn't want to leave because of the relaxed environment.

I highly recommend Cold Spring Tavern, they have cool bands on weekends and a great selection of beers. It's a semi old timer biker bar and has a restaurant for people of all ages."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Sunday only, I think during the summer they server Saturdays too but check the schedule.

Food: 
meal - Tri Tip sandwich ... oh so YUMMY 

The drive up was great and relaxing

Sides: only had condiments i.e. salsa (very spice kick, bbq sauce, apple horseradish)
or commercial brand chips

dessert: semi bar style enviroment, no desserts only selling candy bars


Service: great, simple 

Wait: Sunday, April 25th, 10 @ 12noon - hardly a wait but it was building up

price for all the above: under $10 bucks including tax 

**READY to go back again TODAY!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I rarely write reviews but the absolute absence of service has warranted a one-star review. Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night. Didn't make a reservation which was a mistake--waited for half an hour for a table of four and got a few nice bug bites in the process. That wasn't the Tavern's fault though--but waiting 50 minutes to get my food was. There was one waiter and one busgirl. It was difficult to get their attention when we needed the usual i.e. getting our orders, water, getting the check, etc. as they would be in the other side of the room at 10-15 minutes at a time. 

Food finally came out and it was good, but nothing special and certainly not worth $27 considering the simplicity of the meal--BBQ ribs, mashed potatoes, steamed veggies--shouldn't have taken 50 minutes to get the cooked either. After waiting 15 minutes for the starting course, and an additional 50 minutes for the main course, we got impatient and were ready to leave. We flagged down the waiter for the check with a bit of effort, put our cards down, and were ready to go immediately. The waiter then went outside to grab some stuff for 15 minutes as we sat waiting for him to ring us up. Frustrating. He knew he was making us wait too. Either that or he's totally oblivious. This was the worst service I've probably ever experienced and thus the tip wasn't generous. To put the icing on the cake, I just checked my bank statement and the waiter ended up giving himself a few extra dollars on the tip that I never wrote down nor authorized. Infuriating and unprofessional. 

Long story short, I will never eat dinner here again and I advise you don't either. I probably should have just stuck with the BBQ on the weekends since that's what most people are raving about and that doesn't require any incompetent and deceptive waiters. I'm not usually this scathing, but this experience definitely calls for it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A special place to get away. I love coming up here on a cold night and sitting by the fireplace. It feels like you are really away from everything. It has been awhile, but the live music on Sundays is great too. Hopefully I will make it up soon.  The food could be better, but is always tasty."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a GEM.. venture off the 101 for some music and drinks in a historical cabin nestled in the trees next to a flowing creek.

Sundays only:  smoked tri trip sandwiches $11

It gets chilly so bundle up and park along the road"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Been going to Solvang for years but never heard of this place until my friend that came with us asked us to stop. We drove up and were pleasantly surprised at the live bands, ice cold beers and the tri-tip barbeque. Very cool place to see on your way to and from Solvang!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Okay, so I am writing this review about 12 years after the girl I was dating (now my wife) and I stopped for a couple cold ones.  But I remember it being located off the beaten path deep in a canyon somewhere. Plus it was a blast to get to if you're in a sports car too. Just an all around cool place. I remember it was a hot day, we had the top down and were in the mood for a tall cold one.  My girlfriend at the time recommended that we pay this place a visit.  To this day, I remember it vividly.  Would definitely go back some day!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Super fun my son has mentioned this place a few times and I'm so glad we finally had the opportunity to go.  Nestled in the mountains is this adorable restaurant made up of historical buildings.  We went on a Sunday afternoon which consisted of tri tip sandwiches (super good) and live music.  The place was packed but everyone was super friendly and moved over so there was somewhere to sit for all of us.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Well worth the stop in for the BBQ Beef sandwich or their delicious grilled cheese. My boyfriend and I made a 2hr road trip just so I could show him this place.  Unique atmosphere with some history, friendly people, and awesome food. Service can be great or so-so, depending on who you get and how busy they are, but I've always walked away happy. If you're going up the 101, take the 20 minute side trip to try it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Amazing atmosphere! Hidden in the trees creating a picturesque environment. The tri tip is amazing and there is typically live bands when I've attended on the weekends.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"For breakfast, lunch or dinner, Cold Spring Tavern is a stop on the stagecoach you'll want to make time and time again.

Just off highway 154 and down a windy road you'll first notice (if on a weekend lunch) the rows or cars a motorcycles lining the 2 lane road well before you get there. Nestled in the trees, on a creek and in the shade,  Cold Spring Tavern is refreshingly cool and even something down right cold. Dress accordingly as it's always cooler than you would expect. In the winters, large fireplaces in each room of the old buildings help keep things toasty. There many reasons why to come but I'll start with the first meal of the day.

Breakfast I observed as the quietest time to visit. Although it may get busy, it's not noticeable. The tavern next door to the dining room is not open and that helps keep the crowds down. The menu is standard fare with the country fried steak and huevos rancheros worth mentioning. 

While there are good lunch items on the menu including the buffalo burger and a myriad of home made chili, the real draw is Sundays outside and tri-tip sandwiches on a hoagie. The line is long and forms at the bar for the best meat around. While you're enjoying lunch, live music is playing and people watching is at a high. This is the best meal of the day.

Dinner 'aint cheep but it's well worth it. Meat is on the menu and with wild game a plenty, vegetarians may become ravenous and devour the rabbit, venison or duck. It's a simple menu offering good, solid food. Nothing fancy here folks.

Having lived in the area for over 3 years now, I've made many trips to Cold Springs Tavern and it's always a stock for our friends who come into town. This place is not like anything else around and that's what makes it special. Now I'm hungry. 

See you there!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"love this place. scenic, rustic real food. great place to start day of wine tasting on way over from santa barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Man not an easy place to find but we did and what a great place of history and a awsome bike ride well worth seeing and taking the 154 freeway cutoff is the easiest way in
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"One of the best places, right around the corner from wine country (Los Olivos) to grab a tasty tri trip sandwich on Sunday afternoon 3-6 pm.   There's always music, dancing and a great biker crowd in this woodsy mountain landscape. This is one of my favorite places in SB."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The 5 stars is for the food. The service was a 2.5. Yes, the food was so good I am overlooking the service.

First off, we stood at the counter for at least 5 minutes without even being acknowledged. Then a man came out and asked if he could get us anything. Maybe he was a bartender. Maybe he was a manager? At any rate he made it VERY clear that he would not be going out of his way to seat us, because when we asked for a table for 2 he told us he was sure we could have one, but somebody else would be seating us. It reminded me of my own bratty waitress days, when instead of just getting a table (that wasn't in my section) more waters myself, I'd say ""sure just let me get you your server!"" with a painstakingly choreographed smile to let them know they were beasts for interrupting me and asking me for favors. Or like when you ask a grammar snob ""Can I have bla bla bla?"" and they say ""Well, I don't know; CAN you?"". 

This man effortlessly combined both of those sentiments. Then we were told periodically for another few minutes that it'd just be a few minutes. Gah, I know this isn't really their fault because they WERE really busy (Saturday night), and they were completely setting up our table with water and bread etc (which you might usually already be seated before receiving), but it felt rude. They could have said ""It will be about 5-10 minutes to set up your table and seat you, probably less. Would you like a drink? Would you like to wait outside and we can let you know when we're ready?"" There's no 'waiting area', so we were just standing in the dining room, feet away from other diners, feeling like we were the rude awkward ones. Maybe they're too OG and rustic for uppity things like 'wait times' or 'waiting areas', but for their prices they should really get with the times?

Anyway, we were finally seated and digging into their AMAZING warm wheat bread.  I could eat buckets of that stuff, oh my god. The prices seem a bit steep, but they include the marvelous bread and a starter of soup or salad AND the entree portions are more than ample. ALSO I loved them for their weird dichotomies:
-They served a lot of wild game, chili and ranch but did not seem trashy or redneck-y.
-The menu had a lot of french sauces and preparations but did not seem douchebag-y.
-The menu was very unique but still had something for everybody.

The wait between ordering and courses was excruciatingly awkwardly long, too .AND we asked for a box and still had to wait a long time after to receive the check. Why not bring the check with the box?

I love you Cold Spring. I'll be back anyway!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,The history of this true stage coach stop is so interesting. The atmosphere is true to the western age. Fireplace burning in the different dining areas and original decor sets the mood. We love to go there and take our visitors there. Whether  it's Saturday breakfast or Sunday tri tip sandwiches you will not be disappointed.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"WOW. It takes a trek to get there. This is not a place one would stumble upon. We planned to go, finding a card nestled in my late father's favorite restaurant card pile. Still wondering, how did he find it!
It is an old Stagecoach stop. It is old, dark, romantic and I would not be surprised if the owners had simply found a fountain and youth and wanted to keep this place like the good old days. 
We had the beer battered onion rings....OMG...perfect. Onions not too done, crispy, not greasy at all. You cut them and hear the crunch.
Chili was ok...should have had the wild game black bean.
The Tri Tip sandwich was awesome. Perfectly done, flavored simply with 3 side dips...salsa, BBQ sauce and a horseradish mustard that was amazing.
Dessert...we did it. Had the granny smith cobbler crumble. YES YES YES."

We had to drive for 30 mintes, but the drive itself was worth the trip. The road goes through the mountains with spectacular views. 

Close to the restaurant, we saw some wild animals, which was also fun. 

Looking at the menu, I felt it was too bad I had too choose: I wanted to taste all of it! 

I would definitely come back to this place if I ever visit that area again."

This is a great spot for motorcyclists. the roads are fun and beautiful.
The ambiance is really cool, theres a large fireplace and it feels very homey.  The place comes with a ton of great history and winding roads that lead to it.

Parking is easy. The place does get really crowded and nice days on the weekends so you might need to come with a bit of patience.

Chili is great for a cold day and any of the burgers or sandwiches are great."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Heard about this place from a local in Santa Barbara. Definitely wouldn't have known it existed if not for her so I'm glad she told us! Really cool history and environment and the staff was great. My husband and I both got the tri-tip sandwich and it was excellent. Neither one of us could eat it all so we took home the leftovers! I got the soup which that day was a butternut squash with coconut milk and it was delicious. My husband chose the salad with lingonberry vinaigrette and he enjoyed it as well. Overall excellent stop while staying in Solvang.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"SERVICE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Our server was either the manager or owner, I have no idea to be honest, but she obviously did NOT care about us at all. It was on a Sunday night and they were not busy. We felt very unwelcome with her first glance over at us when we entered. We drove out of our way to end our Solvang trip with a dinner here and what an unfortunate decision it was.

As for the food, I ordered rabbit and boyf got venison. This was my first time trying the rabbit and both were DROWNED in heavy, heavy sauce. Both plates were so heavy-- seriously there's no better word to describe them. Also our ""fresh vegetables"" was just some asparagus stalks thrown on there. The food is definitely UN-exceptional. I guess this is one of the cases where I shouldn't have believed the hype from the Yelp reviews. :(

The bathrooms are located in a different cabin and there's no heating in there. The whole feeling of the Cold Spring Tavern is dark, dreary and drafty. It is not romantic at all. I mean, look at the photo of the weird table setting we had that I uploaded... Don't get me wrong, I love rustic restaurants, but when you're eating deer meat and there's like 3 deer heads just staring in your direction while it's pitch dark, it's just an odd feeling. And I grew up in the South.. believe me, I know ""rustic."" 

My boyf and I were celebrating our anniversary and out of all the restaurants we've been to over the past few years, I think this has to be one of the most inconsiderate and rudest experience we've had.  As Charles H. said, she acted like she was doing us a favor. It seemed like she was having a bad day, but that is NO EXCUSE to be rude. Especially since it was our first (and now, last) time."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Dinner on 01/02/2011. Stopped for dinner on the way back from wine tasting in Santa Ynez. I would agree with many of the reviewers that the  unique building and atmosphere makes the Cold Spring Tavern worth a visit. However, I found the food to be mediocre and open to improvement - it didn't meet my expectations.  Foodies, be warned that eating in this establishment hardly qualifies as a fine dinning experience. I had the peppered steak, which was so so, others in our party had the duck and ribs, and the feeling on the food was universal. The service was mixed, we were seated promptly, orders were taken in good good time and we didn't have to wait long for our food to be served. The major downer was the failure of the staff to control a particularly obnoxious group of diners and their noisy kids. The kids were running around out of control and the adults were conversing very loudly which was disrupting others. In the end a nasty confrontation ensued between two tables that could have been avoided had the staff taken control of the situation earlier. It occurs to me that environment, menu and crowd maybe more suitable for a casual afternoon lunch."

It really doesn't get any better than Cold Spring Tavern. You have a beautiful scenic drive that leads up to the place, and it feels like you've just came across a hidden little gem of a woodsy, comforting restaurant in the forest. Which, by the way, you have. The service is great, and the waitresses are extremely friendly and helpful. I love the warm ambiance, which is often in stark contrast to the foggy, often cold surroundings. It's a wonderful place to go with friends, feel warm, and enjoy amazing chili or burgers with wild game. 

I highly recommend the venison burger or the chili sampler. Great place to take a date if you're looking to impress in Santa Barbara!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Charming, cozy, & a romantic place to dine. I have been a customer of Cold Springs Tavern since the early 80's.
Lunch & Dinner on weekends are busy & a little under staffed. Lunch & Dinner served on weekdays can be busy, but the staff is up to speed with handling the amount of diners that visit. 
Two rooms have fireplace's that are usually fired up with wood during the cooler season month's & evening's. Lights are dim in the the three small indoor dining rooms ... very romantic!   
Food is a little unique with a variety of healthy vegetable, poultry, meat (wild game included), & fish plates. A variety of nice wine options & a few beer options are available. 
My last visit was last night for a early dinner. My husband & I were picking up a few cases of wine in Los Olivos (tasting some too!) & celebrating our First Date Anniversary. 
We dined on Wild Boar Chops & Trout Dinners. The meal came with a wonderful Field Green Salad, Big Baked Potato, & Fabulous Green Beans The food was excellent. Portions were large & a lot more than I could possibly eat.
Our server was very sweet & made a few of her own personal suggestions. We sat in a private little corner with the fireplace behind us. The ambiance & evening was very enjoyable. Another memorable visit for my husband & I.  
Cold Springs Tavern is approx. 1 1/2 hours away from my home. I plan to continue turning on people to this little historical gem & visit as often as I can."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I'm going to round up 3.5 stars to 4 stars.

On our way back from San Luis Obispo, we decided to take a detour and have lunch here. I saw this place on Food Network's Best Things I've Ever Eaten and also my co-worker suggested it. It is literally in the middle of nowhere off the 154 Highway. You have to drive on a winding one-land road for a while and once you start seeing cars along the side of the road, you know you've reached your destination.

Now here's the thing. We came here on a Sunday, when they have Tri-tip sandwiches. I should've read the Yelp reviews in depth because I DID NOT KNOW that it was served outside the restaurant. There was no line at the time so we absolutely overlooked the stand!!! (Smacking my forehead, kicking myself in the bum...).

So....we went inside the restaurant. Immediately, I love it. Homey, comforting, and warm. Loved the decor and the whole ambiance. We sat in one of the back rooms with a fireplace. What a lovely touch!! And it was cold so I appreciated the warmth.

Our waiter should've told us about the Tri tip sandwich ordeal. When our waiter came to take our order, we both said we wanted the tri tip sandwich. I guess the menu has a BBQ tri tip sandwich, which again I overlooked. It would've been nice to get a heads up from our waiter like ""do you mean the weekend special"" or something like that. 

Anyway, we got mushroom bisque and a bowl of chili with our sandwiches. The mushroom bisque was really good. Super creamy and warm, very mushroomy tasting. The Chili however, supposedly their signature recipe was very ordinary. It kind of tasted like Stagg chili. Chunky pieces of beans and meat, with raw onions and cheese topped on it. It was delicious but nothing mind blowing.

And here's where the 3.5 stars come in. The BBQ beef tri tip sandwich was.....in one word, disappointing. The BBQ sauce was overpowering the whole sandwich. And I don't like vinegary BBQ sauce. Not sweet, just way too strong and tangy. They lathered the whole sandwich in this sauce, it was way too much. Second, the tri tip cut was super thick. I don't like it chunky and it's actually hard to eat. The bun was fluffy and soft, the inside contents were sadly not up to par for me. 

Next time we're in the area, I will make sure to open my freakin' eyes and check out the stand outside (they had all sorts of condiments that looked delicious) and also try their pistachio corn chowder (which they were out)."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Me and my girlfriend came in  sunday and this place is really cool. The building was built way back in the 1800s as a stage coach stop on the San Marco pass. The place feels like your on a movie set or something. The tritip was excellent. Nice tender meat. I thought the salsa was great to. Draft beer was kinda warm so maybe stick to bottled.  This place has a great atmosphere good food and the crowd there was friendly. Excellent over all experience I will definitely be back.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The tri-tip sandwiches were excellent.  The two Hispanic cooks preparing the tri-tips where friendly and chatty. I saw a lot of people enjoying the band, dancing around. I like silence, walked to the back benches and ate in a more secluded seating area. 
   The old western feel and look of the old buildings and historic  jail gives this place a not so common atmosphere.  Next time I'll spend some time inside the restaurant."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The journey alone was worth the 5 stars! The place was absolutely perfect! It didn't take too long to get a table for two on a Saturday afternoon, which was pleasantly surprising. The food was ok. I ordered the grilled cheese and the bread was so thick that I had to remove the top piece and attempt to eat it open faced. The bottom piece was so thick that even that presented a challenge. Everyone was friendly. $10 minimum to use your card at the bar. I just have a couple of pairs but people returning for seconds and thirds on bloody Mary's so they must be pretty tasty. The bartender makes her own bloody Mary mix. I have recommended this place to people and I will definitely go back."

The old stagecoach stuff is kind of cute...? The ambiance inside the restaurant is of the historical tavern-kitschy variety. The famous tri-tip sandwiches are good... but not life changing as many describe. 

Our wait on a Saturday morning was under 20 minutes. Service & waitstaff were great. The outdoor, public bathrooms were borderline gross."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The tri-tip sandwiches are worth the wait and the price. Beer was good too. Honestly just a great environment to be surrounded in with all these people laughing, dancing, listening to good music, and having a good time.

Upon arrival, their young male worker gave me this cold look. If you are not in charge as host you don't  have to give us this angry look.

Our waitress is friendly and attentive. 

There are flies everywhere and they kept hitting on the windows. 

--- Tri tip that everybody is rave about it came out dry, salty and over cooked. Bread is flat and soggy. 

-++ Beef soup is flavorful, but a bit salty. They are pretty generous with the beef stew. 

---Chili fries is covered in one big thick piece of melting cheese, there weren't much minced meat inside. Fries is burning hot, but not crispy.

I brought some friends here after a hike - one guy threw down two sandwiches and was able to put a third down if he didn't think his wife would frown upon that. The restaurant has many other options if you miss out on the tri tip or if you come any day other than Sunday. 

Anytime I'm in SB or Santa Ynez, I make it mandatory to stop in, grab a beer, a sandwich, and listen to the band. Tons of bikers too - so check out the bikes while you're there, if you're into that. 

BTW, Cat Cora said it was the best sandwich she ever ate...with that - what are you wating for?"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Casual Dining  3/11/2008

I have to agree with Joan S.' review.  Despite the unique ambience and the beautiful surroundings, Cold Spring Tavern, in terms of food, is overrated.  

As for the restaurant itself, it's located off of the 154 freeway in one of the most least expected areas.  Surrounded by plenty of trees and a spring, the tavern is definitely worth visiting just for the scenery.  There are several rooms to sit in and we decided to occupy the room with the fireplace.  Unfortunately, they had just put out the fire and the room was filled with the smell of smoke.  In one corner of the room was a scythe that felt out of place and beside the table that we sat in was the fur of a bobcat hanging on the wall, with the head still in tact.

While waiting for our food, I had somewhat high expectations for my Bar-B-Q Venison Sausage Burger ($10.00) with a potato salad on the side.  The sausage patty, made from deer, was overcooked but the red onions were perfectly tender.  The overall experience wasn't satisfying, and the barbecue sauce did not work well with the sausage patty either.  In addition, the potato salad tasted too 'rich,' the yolk from the egg and the onions as well, were overwhelming.  

The next order was a bit more conservative, the Cold Spring Chili Burger ($9.25), and it didn't fair any better on the grill.  The meat was dry, and the chili was too beany; it felt more like a bean burger.  The bread from the burger bun was grilled appropriately however, and I couldn't find any complaints.  It was crispy where I wanted it to be and paired better with the chili.  As to what everyone else suggested, maybe next time I should go with the tri-tip sandwich.

Having heard so many good responses to this place, we decided on a dessert and it may have been the best part of the meal, Granny Smith Apple Cobbler ($5.95), not the one you'd find from the frozen food section, mind you.  Served hot, it didn't look anything like a pie at all, almost reminiscent of bread pudding.  It was littered with pecans, 3 small scoops of whip cream, and puff pastry. There was also a hint of lemon, as a surprise.

Final Verdict: 9/20  If you're a big fan of Chumash Casino, head down the 154 and don't be afraid to take a peek.  Then pick up some fudge at Solvang, if you have room left in your stomach.  But be prepared to find out that just because a place is authentic, doesn't necessarily mean the food comes out better."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Unique destination with a menu to match! Sort of a ""must do once"" bucket list kinda place. Great drive if you need a place to go with your sports car or motorcycle. We were forced to eat inside in the somewhat cold and near-dark conditions. I recommend saving this for the summer or early fall so you can sit outside and enjoy the natural sound and beauty of the namesake spring.

Decent beer selection. I had the venison sausage burger. The burger was quite large and good quality. The bun had a home made or bakery quality to it. Prices were a little on the high side. Onion rings, two sandwiches and 2-3 beers for $50+ with tip seemed a bit high for lunch. Same meal at dinner would seem like a better value. 

Service was surprisingly cold and indifferent but efficient, as if he was doing us a favor?"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold spring tavern began as a  stagecoach stop in 1886. It's current owners has done a remarkable job in preserving the historic charm of the place, yet offers some of the best foods you can find in the modern time. The place is situated in a beautiful spot nestled on the historic stagecoach road. While the location is a little far from the city, but it's well worth the drive. Once you get there, you'll feel truly relaxed and hopefully taken by the rustic charm of the place.

The staff is always nice and helpful, the food is very fresh and tasty. Lunch menu is casual. The BBQ tri tip sandwich is very good, and the charbroiled chicken sandwich is also very nice. The grilled pork chops was delicious. The price for lunch is very reasonable. They do the BBQ outside next to the Tavern, the smell makes your month water instantly.

The price of dinner is higher, but I think it's justifiable. They offer venison and rabbits. I've had the salmon daily special before and it's cooked very well and tasted great. I've yet to try the venison or rabbit, but judging from  my past experience they should taste great as well.

My husband and I have been to this place many times over the years, it's always been great. In the summer weekends they have live music outside. In the winter, there is snow sometimes and the place turns into a winter wonderland. It's cold and air is crisp. You can smell the pine trees in the air. You can almost feel that a stage coach may pull up any minutes.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"There is a windy road leading to the restaurant, we went right after a rain storm and there were a lot of rocks on the road from the earth shifting.  If you go there in the rain watch out for falling rocks.  The restaurant is so cool and if it isn't over 100 years old they did a good job making it look like it was.  There isn't a lot of dedicated parking so you are parking along the street around the building.  The food was excellent and the furniture were all older pieces and a mish mosh of different old wooden chairs so not the most comfortable to sit on but I liked it.  Made you feel like you were taking visiting a time capsule.  I had an omelet with the biscuit on the side.  The biscuits are HUGE and you get gravy with them so I would say it's a no brainer to order that."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"On Sundays, next to the Tavern, a big Samoan dude grills the best Tri-Tip sandwiches.  The reason why they're so good is the horseradish sauce; I have yet to find any anywhere near as good.  The water they serve is directly from the cold spring and you can taste the goodness (Avian ain't got nothing on it).

The patrons are either bikers (the Harley variety, not like a bicycle), yuppies or college kids.  There's no in between.  Also, they have a folk band playing.

One piece of advice, if you're going North on 154, turn right on Paradise Road (just after the bridge) and then right again on Stagecoach and follow it up and around.  If you're going South, don't try and cross traffic and turn left; a few meters down the road will be your very own chance to turn right Stagecoach Road (the road loops around like that)."

Located off Highway 154, CST is nestled in a thickly forested valley. Talk about your rustic charm; this place is the epitome thereof. 

Being weary travelers, we each had something venison (venison sausage burger and venison sandwich), and we decided to split the chili trio to fuel us through the duration of our journey. All the food was tasty. The chilis were all really good; I think the Cold Spring Chili was our favorite! Plus they have a surprising selection of beers. 

And hey, if they happen to be closed when you stop, just go next door and grab a beer from the other tavern and a tri-tip sandwich from the BBQ guys outside! 

This used to be a rest stop for covered wagons coming west to look for gold; it will now be a rest stop for me looking for a nice break in my drive!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is well worth stopping by, and I only regret not doing so sooner! We were headed back to LA from Santa Ynez and I'd heard about the brisket sandwich here and determined that THIS time we'd go check out Cold Spring Tavern.

You guys, the drive over there alone is pretty awesome: you go under the bridge that everyone drives over, and it is just plain stunning to look up at that. We could tell when we were getting close to Cold Spring Tavern because the road was suddenly lined with parked cars. They have a lot of space there, so it didn't seem overcrowded or crazy busy, but you can tell it's popular. 

We learned at the bar that we could order a beer there plus a ticket for the brisket sandwich, then grabbed a seat at a picnic table outside, got our sandwiches (plus extra bbq sauce on the side) and had one of the best Sunday lunches I can remember: cold beer, delicious sandwich, amazing setting (you're in a forest on the side of the mountain). I highly recommend a stop here: I know I'll be back next time we make that drive!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Where to start...

...oh yeah, they make the best sandwiches I ever had! Yummy yummy yummy.

This place is perfect if you want to immerse in the American culture: tavern hidden in the woods  (only known by locals), long line to get your sandwich ticket (that means this place is good), country music bands, Harley-Davidson bikers gathering (and show-off), barbecue smell, beers, leather used biker coats and boots, cowboy hats, thousands pounds of meat, best homemade sauces ever, sunburns, meet-up, hangout, families, happiness... SO CHILL!

I love this place, I've been there twice and I'll go there again.

I was about to forget the tip: this only happens on Sundays so don't go there on Saturdays."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Absolutely love this place! The ambiance throws you back into the old stagecoach times.  The food will make you drool with delight.  My girlfriend got the crab omelette and I got the breakfast burrito.  She said it was the best omelette she has ever had, and my burrito was pretty darn good too.  I make this a stop on every wine trip to Santa Inez, and I suggest it to every friend who goes there as well.  It is a must stop kinda place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great food. Great music on Sundays!
A more delightfully eclectic crowd you never find."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Beautiful. Deep in the woods on a little road off 154 between Santa Barbara and the Santa Ynez Valley. 

The setting alone--that stone cabin underneath all those trees--well, you see the picture. That's my idea of heaven...a little nook nestled in the mountains under a canopy of trees. 

I suppose I should review the food, but I arrived between their lunch and dinner, so alas...didn't eat, as I had to continue to Santa Barbara to catch a flight. It sort of didn't matter though. I spent some time there and it was just beautiful. Had I stayed for dinner, they could have served me boxed mac'n'cheese and I would have gladly paid for it...just to be in that setting. 

I look forward to returning up that windy road for a cold beer after a long drive. So gorgeous!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Before I write the review, I took a look at the rating details.  It seems that the curve fluctuate between 3.5 to 5 star.  Then, I read some of the reviews.  Some disappointing and some encouraging.  Here is the deal ...

This is a hang out place for bikers and people who like bikers.  They have live music, and great food.  If you need 5 star resort service, do not come to this place.  This is pretty down to earth place.  But if you are real, and you enjoy a great tri tip sandwich and cold beer and good live music, then give it a try.  I stopped by over the weekend for the first time, and I will be there again.  I will ride my bike there despite the fact that I may get stuck in the heavy traffic from LA to Santa Barbara and back.  Worth every minute of the traffic and money you spend.  this is a 5 star place in my book.  

Hey, a quick tip, have them cut the sandwich in half, so you can handle it!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I'm continuously in press with this spot. Has beautiful Scenic Vistas, wonderful shade trees and ample outdoor seating areas. You want to visit car bicycle or motorcycle everyone is welcome here. My last visit I was pleasantly surprised that they were aware of gluten sensitivities and even offered me meet that had not been soaked in beer. I highly suggest this to anyone who wants to experience tri-tip at its finest. In a sandwich form or just the meat if you have any gluten sensitivities. It's a great place to come out with friends and family to kick back and have some cocktails and some great food."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I have been making the trek to this hidden gem since 1983. Enjoy the eclectic mix of patrons on Sunday afternoons for Tri-tip and live entertainment. This place will not disappoint and is worth the drive up from SB!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Stopped on our way to Paso. I had made reservations for breakfast, there was 8 of us. The coffee, food and service was great.  Everyone should visit the tavern at least once. It is a very unique restaurant and the location is secluded. Will definitely be back to try dinner."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern is such a cool spot. We stopped here for dinner after a Valentine's Day trip to Solvang. The tavern is located in the middle of the woods, along a winding road, all by itself. Such an awesome location! As you are parking your car you can immediately smell the bbq scent in the air. Yum! We couldn't wait to try their famous tri tip sandwich. Holy cow it was good! You first pay for the tri tip at the bar, you receive a ticket, and then head outside to the bbq area and get your sandwich fresh off the smoker. It was probably the best tri tip I have ever had. There is also a full bar, live music, and a great outside area for hanging/eating/drinking. What a fun place!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern is an awesome, cozy place to go for lunch or dinner. It used to be a rest stop for stagecoach travelers. Located in the mountains, I felt like I was camping again. FYI, the parking lot is pretty small. My friends and I came here for dinner on President's Day and made reservations for 6:30pm. When we got there, we were greeted by a friendly staff which told us to wait since our table wasn't ready yet. However, we waited for quite a while and the staff didn't check up on us or say anything while we were waiting. There were lots of open tables around and I wasn't sure what was taking so long. There was like no point in making a reservation since we still had to wait for a while. It wasn't even that busy! Anyways, we were finally seated and it was time to eat!

We ordered the Venison Sausage Stuffed Mushrooms ($11), the Cold Spring Chicken ($24) and the Tri Tip Sandwich (($19.50). The chicken and the sandwich came with two sides each. We had their mash potato, clam chowder, jasmine rice and beef chili. Everything was soooo delicious! I liked all the side dishes and my favorite main dish was the stuffed mushrooms and the sandwich. We heard their Tri Tip Sandwich was a must-get dish and it was so yummyy. The Cold Spring Chicken was baked with almond raisin stuffing smothered in sberry, sour cream and and mushroom sauce. It was really interesting since it was sweet and savory. The stuffed mushroom was baked in garlic butter with fresh parmesan cheese. Soooooo goooodd! 

Although the service was kind of bad in the beginning, it got better later. Our server was great and recommended lots of dishes for us. I love the environment and the history behind the restaurant and no doubt was the food on point. FYI, restrooms are located outside of the restroom, right next to it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This is a funky, out of the way spot that makes a good getaway about 20 minutes from Santa Barbara.  It gets very crowded on weekends, with lots of motorcyclists and others passing through.  It is beautifully situated among the oak trees and beside a creek in a canyon about a mile off of Hwy 154.  Great place to have a couple of cold beers and listen to some live music (though we left before the band fired up), and the food was okay.  The three chili sampler was fine, the quiche okay, and others said the tri-tip sandwiches were good.  The waitress was pretty clueless when asked basic questions about the menu, but the owner came by and introduced himself and thanked us for being there.  The building is an authentic and historic old cabin that is permeated with the smell of smoke; not overpowering, but close to it.

I was glad to have visited, but not sure if I would go out of my way to go back.  I would recommend trying it for the atmosphere and setting, if nothing else."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Good food good location. I had the Half Pound Charbroiled Buffalo Burger very good. The location unchanged since the days of the stagecoach run, is rich in California history. You will love it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This is such a magical little spot. I love coming here for lunch or just for a beer. I highly recommend coming here weekend nights for the live band! However the times we've eaten inside the restaurant the waitress hasn't been very friendly. We've felt like we were a burden to her even tho we didn't ask for anything special at all any of the times. For such an awesome spot they should have little friendlier service (talking only about inside the restaurant because the lady in the bar building is super sweet!)
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place was a wonderful treat! great food no waiting and very interesting!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Tri tip sandwiches on a Sunday is a wonderful way to kick back on a lazy afternoon.  Have a drink, grab your sandwich when you are ready and visit with your neighbors at the communal tables.  

A couple of tips:
1.  Go early if you can, parking is limited on this narrow road.
2.  Ask them to cut your sandwich in half....even if you intend to eat the whole thing.  Just easier to manage.
3.  Don't miss the au jus at the sandwich counter - you need to dish it out yourself.
4.  ALL of the condiments they offer at the self serve stand are good.  Grab a couple extra of the au jus containers and pour them on your sandwich as you eat.  The bun doesn't disintegrate and you get to mix and match toppings as you eat. 
5.  If you have a motorcycle now is the time to break it out.  You will be in good company.

Great mix of people, good food and beautiful views make for a memorable afternoon!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place is a must. Beautiful historical spot. Great food and well priced. Had a great time here. The place is so charming and cute.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"THE hangout for the biker communities that live in these hills, this is their bar on the weekends. Be grateful they haven't lost their patience with all the tourists and DINKs poking their noses in and getting their little cars stuck in the mud. I'm not a biker, but I'd be ready to beat up Rachael Ray if she showed up screeching, ""Tri-tip sammies, Yum-O!""
But that's part of the beauty of the bar at Cold Spring Tavern, it's the crossroads to a diverse range of customers. You will see bikers, you will see yuppies, you will see the woodland locals, you will see surly students in hoodies, and it's all par for the course and everyone amazingly gets along.
Anyway, I want to point out that there is a distinction between the  restaurant area and the bar area.
The restaurant is where they serve the game food and other exotics. It's dark and cozy, rustic-romantic, with good quality food.  Dropping $40-60 per person on a dinner there would not be unusual. Reservations recommended.
The bar is on the other side of the Tavern property, a completely separate building and it is as different as night and day to the restaurant. This is where the bikers, bands and delicious tri-tip sandwiches are. It's a lot more casual, it can be noisy and really fun. You come and go as you please. This is the area that's closer to $10/person. A glass of beer is a little on the skimpy side, but do you really come here just for the beer? Hells angels no."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Outstanding!  Get the chili made with rabbit, venison and bison.  Sit in front of the fireplace. Enjoy!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is an experience that everyone should have. A unique historical Tavern from 1865 and we are all blessed to be able to enjoy a wonderful barbecue here inside this magical location. 
We seat inside and ordered the famous tri tip Sandwich. Because I don't eat much we shared. 
Yes it is crowded but is worth the drive. Also we were seated after only 15 minutes.
Than we walked around and saw all interesting buildings and joy."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Place is adorable! Food was delish, portions were large; however, service once we received our food was poor. I had to stand up to get the attention of any waiter I could find.  One waiter came and assisted the table next to us 3 times and never asked if we needed to be topped off, a box, or the check as we sat there will empty cups, plates set aside, and hands on our laps. Other than the poor service, the place was great."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Their BBQ is goood!!! I love their tri tip sandwich and BBQ ribs. A very cozy, romantic restaurant up in the mountain. I went to santa barbara wine tasting with a group of close friends and we stopped by this tavern because of the yelp ratings and without a doubt. The ratings definitely confirm the delicious BBQ sandwich, even the bread holding the tri tip sandwich is crispy and soft at the same time."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We LOVED Cold Springs Tavern! The tri tip was out of this world. We also got the chili sampler which was amazing. The house chili was my favorite. It's a small place so if you're going with more than two people, it's a good idea to get a reservation. Even if you're going at lunch."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What an awesome place to stop for the afternoon. I got the tri-tip and a bowl of chili. Both were excellent. 

The setting is rustic, rough hewn cabins on a narrow winding road. Smoke was wafting through the air from the grills. The place was packed. 

Stop in, have a beer and get some lunch. I want to go back here on a motorcycle ride. 

Parking is an issue. You'll likely find a space in the side of the road."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place was very packed when I came with my brother & bf. It was very cold also. I'd recommend wearing warm clothing since it is located in the mountains. Wish there were more places to sit inside all around the area then having to be outside. The food is great also they have some very interesting items to chose from & different locations to eat. They serve beer & alcoholic beverages. Some bands of some sort play here. Don't know much about the area since I've only been here one time. Would consider coming again. Most of the people here seem older. I'm in my 20's. But the people all seemed very nice & comfortable here. Tri tip sandwiches were very delicious.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I discovered Cold Springs Tavern about 8 years ago while driving through the San Marco Pass on my way home from Big Sur.  I thought I'd beat traffic on the 101 FWY by taking a ""short cut"" on the 154.  Little did I know that this short cut would add five hours to my drive home--but the best, most fun five hours ever!

The Tavern is a gem tucked into a mountain-side.  There's no advertising for it on the 154.  If you know about it, great!  If you don't, your tragedy is that you'll drive right past it and never get to experience its energy.  

All the other reviewers do a great job at describing the place.  It is a little bi-polar with the restaurant and the bar, but I'd never even considered that until I read the reviews. Truth be told, I've only ever visited the resturant once--a few years ago for lunch.  The bar itself, the music, the patons, the Tri-Tip sandwiches are what keep me coming back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"OMG great place to go back in time and have great food. It was worth the drive up the mountain, even with the fog, and my folks who are picky loved the tri tip sandwich, the onion rings are fantastic, the buffalo burger was delish, and the place, although small, was so charming. Go back in time and come here. there isnt alot of parking and hard for disabled persons, but my Dad who walks with a cane still said it was worth it. A great spring flowing and huge oak trees and you can smell the cooking as soon as you park.  Great servers as well considering how crowded it was on a Saturday."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I could die a happy death here. I have been coming here for 5+ years when I discovered the place at UCSB. I've dined in, had the tri tip and hosted an event so let me break it down.

Dine in: the food here is superb. I remember the wild boar dish sticking out to me along with the artichoke dish. The ambience transporta you back to the 1850's during gold mining days. AWESOME.

Tri tip sundays: PRO TIP: Make it up to cold springs by at least 3 pm to make sure you get a sandwich. They do sell out! THIS IS THE GREATEST SANDWICH IN CALIFORNIA. Use all of the sauces they provide - they hot mustard is the best. The live music is always great and while the beer selection is minimal it is always tasty.

Events: I hosted a graduation party for about 80 people in the back patio space on a sunday afternoon. We were able to order tri tip sandwiches and listen to music while having our own music in the back. We had kegs and snacks provided by cold springs along with a few bottles of wine. The event went perfectly and everyone had a legendary time. GREAT place for a party !"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Your food always tastes better miles from home on the side of a mountain in a natural setting surrounded by oak trees and next to a babbling brook. It's just some sort of unwritten law.

Stve W. (see photo) and I ate breakfast here on the way to Solvang one weekend and dare I say it was just about the best part of the trip."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold springs is well worth the short drive from Santa Barbara. It is a very popular lunch spot on the weekends, so best to get there early. They start serving lunch at 11:00. The tri tip sandwich is easily their most popular lunch item, and for good reason. They are very generous with the meat, which is extremely tender, and they have some great toppings: bbq sauce, horseradish mustard, fresh salsa. It beat all of my expectations."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Serendipity!  My hubby and I were exploring new places in and around the foothills and stumbled across this place quite by accident. A cool oasis in the middle of a hot, dusty drive.  They've kept the rustic feel of the waystation and turned it into a darn good chowhouse.  I heartily recommend the tri-tip sandwich.  Hub and I had already eaten a picnic lunch, so we split it and a bowl of chili verde for ""second lunch.""  Staff is very friendly and service is quick.  We found this mid-afternoon, mid-week so the place was not overly crowded.  
My mother knew about this place for years as Mattie's Tavern, apparently, but she never saw fit to share the knowledge with me until we came back to her Santa Maria home raving enthusiastically about our fortunate lunch find. (""Oh yeah!  Great little spot!""  Thanks for the tip, Mom~!)
I won't make that mistake- will definitely tell others about this great little place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This spot was definitely one of the most unique restaurants we've been to. It was in the middle of the forest and had a beautiful interior and rustic exterior . The service was fantastic and so was the food. We will definitely return!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Just had an awesome meal at Cold Spring Tavern at the end of a fun weekend in SB wine country. What a cool and unique spot way out in the woods! A former stagecoach stop turned restaurant and bar, the place smells and feels like history. 

The food is terrific... I had the pepper steak, served with choice of potato and starter. I went with the famous homemade beef chili, which was great. My girlfriend and I so split the appetizer platter, featuring stuffed mushrooms, stuffed artichoke, and tiger shrimp, all covered in cheesy buttery cream sauce.

The drink selection is great too... tons of local beers and wines available from the bar.

The restaurant is located next to a great rustic bar. This lave is totally worth the journey up the windy mountain, and it's only 15 minutes away from Santa Barbara."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"First you take the PCH, then you take a right turn into the Los Padres National Forest on a small, windy 154 road, only to find yourself on an even windier, narrow road surrounded by scenic views and cliffs and then, out of nowhere, you'll find Cold Spring Tavern.

I had first heard of the place while watching a TV show on the Food Network well over a decade ago, and remember chef Cat Cora mentioning that it was one of her favorite places ever. The show, Best Thing I Ever Ate put some spotlight on their tri-tip sandwich, which the chef raved about. I knew that if in the area, I'd have to go check it out, and eventually did.

Cold Spring Tavern was established in 1886, as a stagecoach stop. They serve local fare, icy cold beers, and even some wild game. If you plan well or happen to hit this place on the weekend though, this is when they serve their popular tri-tip sandwiches ($10) which are cooked outside. The smell is quite possibly the best smell in the world and the sandwich is absolutely divine.

We hung out for a bit. We ate our food inside before hanging out outside for a bit, by moving to a different area which has a bar. It's scenic, it's quiet and frankly one of the best indoor/outdoor experiences I've ever had. I can't recommend this place enough."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"My friend Kevin and his friend Carol had a gig up there, (he's a singer/songwriter, she a singer), and asked me to play piano on one of the songs (""Silver Spring"" by Fleetwood Mac). It's a nice trip up there, beautiful location..............but..............THE PLACE IS INFESTED BY FLIES!! From the moment we set up to the moment we drove home, the flies swarmed around us in big black hordes, it was like being in a horror movie. They flew into my eyes,, into the mouths of Kevin and Carol, everywhere. It was too hot, so even when we went inside to get a drink, the flies were there too, like an evil detective. It was a fucking nightmare. I couldn't enjoy one moment of being in this historic location because of the flies. If the Devil himself, the Lord of the Flies, had come onto the property I would have pledged my allegiance to him as long as he, as Lord of the Flies, told the fucking flies to fly the fuck away!!

Horrible horrible experience. I'm sure the food was good but no way would I eat ANYTHING in that hot, fly-infested purgatory."

Well of the beaten path and a biker heaven. They have a big bbq that serves tri-tip sandwhiches in the summer and OMFG !! None better and also they gave sauces you can put on, my favorite is the very spicy pico type sauce. My god.. I ate 2 of them.. what a pig !!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I am admiringly a fan. 
I first drove up to this place on a rainy day. The bar was empty, the fire was lit and the coffee was hot.
We ate the tri-tip sandwich (which runs from super tender to a little tough at times)  but it don't matter. Stopping there is a trip back in time. And a peaceful spot. 
But be warned:  I have only gone during the week days and I understand that come the weekend, the place is over run by ""weekend warriors"" on their Harleys... I recently was witness to this on a Friday afternoon... overheard the conversation as they parked their bikes... ""we're heading up to the SPA for the weekend..."" Yeah... those ""weekend warriors"".
but go for dinner: go during the week. its a beautiful simple good place to eat and breathe"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"It is with deep regret I write this review. There is a recent menu change where the menu has been reprinted. Certain things have been left out. A special we ordered, bison osso bucco was most definitely a shank not the cut of meat typically served in osso bucco and undercooked (tough), the duck with shallot demi glacé had an orange sauce that could not be ignored and was not mentioned on the menu, and the rabbit medallion was change to rabbit loin but it's still a rabbit roulade or it mostly taste like filler and not rabbit. It's a shame because lunch here is amazing, service is great, atmosphere is perfect, but the dinner menu is unclear and needs work on some of the dishes. We have been customers for 15 years, we will keep going back but hope to see Change so it's not just weekend lunch we go for. The dinner apps are amazing, venison mushrooms for sure."

Came to this restaurant in celebration of the holidays. The service was very good and our waiter was a humorous one. The man made a variety of jokes and provided some entertainment for the evening. 

The decor was like any cabin: complete with formerly live animals nailed to the wall staring right back at ya! 

Our group shared an appetizer platter, which had Stuffed Mushrooms and Pasta Marinara. Yummy! For my entree, I had the Stuffed Chicken with Vegetables and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Wasn't bad, but hearty and tasty. I was able to save almost half a plate as leftovers. I also got to try a few bites of the Crab Ravioli, which was rich, creamy and flavorful. 

Bonus: the bread given at the beginning of your meal is just delicious! Soft and bites full of yumminess."

Sandwich sales occur on the weekend and I believe they stop selling at 5pm. Very rustic and relaxing atmosphere."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Somewhere near that giant green bridge on the 154 highway is where Cold Spring Tavern is hidden. When I got here my first impression was this places looks like something out of the Universal Studios tour, once I got inside I realized this place has actually been around since the late 1800s. I came here with some friends to try their tri tip sandwiches. What I got was a little underwhelming, for $10 they got kind of cheap on the amount of steak I got on my sandwich, and the meat wasn't that tender,  but they again it was a cold/gloomy day outside & from what my friend told me it's usually really busy here so I'm guessing the food may have been sitting in the heat pans longer than they expected.

Because of the location & how cool this place is I'd be willing to give it another chance next time I visit Santa Barbara in hopes that my first meal was just an off day."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"If you are hungry and have an interest in early California then you should visit Cold Spring Tavern.  Over one-hundred years ago, this was an actual stagecoach rest stop.  It sits in a tree-covered ravine on Stagecoach Road, just off H154 near San Marcos Pass in the Santa Ynez Mountains.  It's a 15-minute picturesque drive up from the intersection of H154 and H101 and it's a 20-minute drive if you're coming from Santa Ynez.  The original building still stands and serves as the Tavern's dining room.  It is a simple rustic wood-frame structure with a potbelly stove and a stone fireplace nestled in its dining areas to keep visitors warm on cold days and evenings.  With lots of atmosphere and a very good menu, it warrants a visit anytime you are passing through or wine tasting in nearby Santa Ynez Valley.  Lunch and dinner is served every day and on weekends a hardy breakfast is also featured - visit their website for complete menus. Recommended."

I'll be in a car next weekend, and I will be back. Any time I am in the area from now on - I am getting that amazing BBQ sandwhich, some beer, and some great people watching. Maybe a dance or two.

It gets no more simple than this - and no better."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Tri tip was quite dank, and the beer was a decent price for being way out in the cuts. Crowd was interesting, wished the tri tip was a bit more juicy on the medium rare side but ours was slightly over cooked. Overall- giving it the 4 star since the decor was dope and it felt like we were out in the wilderness but not really and the drive was fun if you got a fast whip."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We went there on a summer sunday afternoon for sandwiches and beer. Be prepared with cash! Sandwiches are around $10, beers about $4, and onion rings are $8 (they are damn good though). There are enough places to sit and enjoy the live band and do some serious people watching. Definitely will be coming back to do this again soon!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This is a beautiful spot and an equally beautiful drive. Our food was fantastic as was the service. Roaming the grounds was a treat. I look forward to returning in the summer to enjoy their live music.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great atmosphere, awesome food
Tri-Tip delish
Great place for weddings, events
Bring a sweater, it sometimes gets a little chilly at night"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Best BBQ Steak Sandwich. Worth a 2 hrs drive.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,The strangest steakhouse i've ever been to but I love it! The food is great and the location is amazing plus its rich in history. Check it out.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Loved this place and the drive to find it! Really wasn't expecting any vegan options but they have a great veggie patty burger! Of course for the non vegans the tri tip bbq-ing outside looked really good. Very easy to get a table inside and we got to hang out outside and explore the little back patio with good people and some good music! Really recommend making a pit stop here!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Been going here for years.Personality and good food.Well worth the drive up from Santa Barbara .You mostly have to worry about to much good food and drink...
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Great place for grub and beers. It's has plenty of history to it and well worth the drive. BBQ on the weekends and the tri tip is delicious with an ice cold beer. Great place to head to if you are up for an adventure. The restrooms need a little work but will do in a pinch.. Best little hide away
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"this place is like a fairy tale. with really good food. is it too much to ask for a place like this to exist closer to home?  the answer is yes.  

so if you're passing through, be sure to take the short detour to stop in here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I love this place! It feels like your own little hideaway in the woods; that also happens to serve great food and drinks. Always a must stop for us when in SB.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Best Secret in Santa Barbara!!!  You feel like you left the modern world and stepped back in time to a simpler more peaceful world.  I love the rustic feel this place has and was blown away at how great the food is I honestly was not expecting it but boy was I wrong.   You honestly can't go wrong with anything you order.   If you are in Santa Barbara and just want to check out for a bit alone or with friends and escape this is the place...
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,The MOST UNIQUE restaurant I've ever been to. It really takes you back in time. Great food and great atmosphere :)
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I went for lunch, at 2 pm on a Friday. First, let me say that the location is AWESOME, and the buildings are so cool--well-preserved and well-decorated.

However, my dining experience was seriously lacking. The lunch menu is tiny, though reasonably priced, so if you're looking for anything other than a burger, don't come here for lunch. The dining areas are very, very dark, so also don't expect to enjoy a beautiful Santa Barbara day or be able to read the menu without help of your flashlight iPhone app. The hostess and waiter were both completely personality-less and inattentive. I don't want someone hovering over my shoulder the whole meal, but a smile and a ""How you guys doing today? Have you been here before?"" goes a long way with me, and I did not receive that kind of simple decency. 

I'd still say this place is worth experiencing, though don't go for lunch!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is an iconic historic quality eatery and tavern.  The food we got looked like it was out of sunset magazine. Tritip piled high and done just right, cobb salad w big chunks of ham and lots of bacon, cold beer and ice tea, perfect. The place is quaint, clean and well run. I've lived in Ventura for 20 years and can't believe i waited this long to finally make it here. I'm so happy. What a find."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"PERFECTION! I see now why this place has so many stars, great reviews, and beautiful photos! We had the most delicious post-camping breakfast here, and everyone LOVED their food. Our waiter was quick, and helpful; especially when my nephew accidentally at a jalapeño seed and started crying! His care and concern was definitely appreciated  The decor is just tragically charming, and I'm ready to sell my home and move right in! If this place were closer to home, I could see spending every weekend here! Edited to add: Get there early, like 10am, because the crowds start living up thereafter."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Such a fun place to visit! After living in the area, finally made a trip out there. Driving wise pretty easy to find. As soon as you get close you'll start to see cars parked alongside the road. Even though I was there on a weekend during 'lunch time' I didnt have to park very far away. Only waited about 15 mins to be seated inside. While you wait theres a little craft store off to the side with really cute handmade wares! My mom and I each bought a ring from Violet who actually custom sized the rings we liked while we waited! If you want to eat outside, you can order to go from the kitchen and take your chances finding a table. This would be nice during the times when there is live music playing! 
The food was great. Hamburgers are hefty so sharing is def a good idea if you feel you may not be able to eat the entire thing.
Overall really enjoyed my time here and hopefully will be back soon!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This was my first time there and I will definitely go back next time I'm in Santa Barbara.  The drive is nice and the location is really cool. Nice people and great food. The garlic mashed potatoes were the best that I've ever had!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is beautiful. For me, it hits all the right notes. Good food, well-priced, and wonderful ambiance.  The lunch prices were such a good deal. Averaged about ten bucks or less per person.

 I had a cinnamon hot tea and Tri Tip sandwich. BBQ-y goodness. Crispy fries. SO good. All this right next to a lovely fireplace. And surrounded by more nature than I'm used to.

 My boyfriend had a simple grilled chicken sandwich and fries. He thought it was' pretty standard' but the atmosphere made up for it. He probably would give this place a 4 as he is pickier than I am.

There was also a cobb salad and a chili lunch at the table which were described as spectacular. 

Our waitress was lovely too. Her boss was being kind of a jerk to her and she took it in stride. That was the only downside to our trip here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"AWESOME place.  Spent a Saturday afternoon listening to live music outside with beautiful weather, cold beer, and great tri-tip sandwich."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Awesome historic place to stop and eat between Santa Barbara & the Santa Ynez Valley.  Really good tri-tip sandwich & chili verde.  We got there before the lunch rush and had no wait.  Good service also.  Really unique experience!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Surprisingly, Cold Spring Tavern has one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. It tastes and looks like they make the veggie pattie in-house, which is a plus. I can't for sure say what's in it but it seems to have a black or white bean base as opposed to an alternative-meat product. The burger is huge, very filling, and delicious. You won't be fooled into thinking it's a meat burger, but that's just fine because it wholly stands on its own in ticking off all the boxes of taste-bud excellence. You have to order it from inside, but otherwise it's a great option for vegetarians who still want to enjoy this idyllic little restaurant up in the mountains, especially if coming with friends to enjoy the tri-tip cookout and music on weekends. This place has an eccentric, eclectic mix of patrons which makes visits a blast. You'll see everyone from bikers to SB townies to cruise ship tourists. Everyone is always friendly, despite parking being a bit tough to nab. If you're going on the weekend, I advise arriving early to grab a good parking spot and picnic table to enjoy the music, drinks, and food. While this place is known for their meat cookouts, the veggie burger is well worth a try!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Quaint old building, unfortunately had to use flashlight on my phone to see menu.
Service was fine. My sisters prime rib was quite good. The baby back ribs were way over cooked- very dry and almost burnt.
String beans tough. Glad we tried it but would not return."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great place to see, busy but friendly and professional. It's old stagecoach stop above Santa Barbara, good food no inexpensive.  Good choices of beer and wine and of course food. Parking can be an issue but you just park along road get a reservation"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Hidden gem! My new must stop place when going up north to Santa Barbara.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Went here for the first time based on reviews here and food tv seeing this place.  We were coming back from a wine tasting trip and decided to hit this place after a nice drive down 154.  OMG, I forgot there was still some beautiful scenery left in California (la boy...).

After winding down this very narrow and curvy tiny 2 lane road - BAM - out pops this little group of shacks.... looks incredible and I'm getting excited already.  We walk into the first one, its' the bar, very cool looking place, but we head down the path to the right a little to the restaurant.  You walk in the front and get nervous as its' soooo tiny, but then you wind around and see additional little rooms.  VERY COOL.  Great fun atmoshere being an old stagecoach stop.

We were having a late lunch, so we start with a bowl of their chili.  Very very good and tasty.  I had the Tavern Burger and my gf had the Tri Tip sandwich.  Both of these were fantastic and very flavorful.  I ""hear"" on Sunday's they have a local guy come in and he is BBQ'ing Tri Tip right on the grill outside and the place is jumping with people out for a Sunday cruise.  But today on Sat was no dissapointment.

Overall a must stop , I'm glad we traveled the back road home from the wine country of santa ynes and I will definitely go back.  NOTE - it really is only about 15-20 mins back off the 101 so definitely worth the little detour.  Also, if during the day, after lunch head down the street a little bit and take a look at the bridge, way cool.  You do not get the same perspective while you are driving over it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Pretty drive up into the mountains of SB. I found this place from a ""brunch in Santa Barbara"" search on Google. My husband and I drove up to check it out. The night before it poured.... So if that happens be careful once you get on to the little road taking you to the Tavern. Rocks lay all over from the storms. 

I got the side of biscuits and gravy. It was filling and good. My husband got sausage, eggs and potatoes. Big servings- we couldn't finish it. 

Upon our arrival (Sunday morning @ 10am) there was not many people in. Once we were paying the whole place was filled. It's rustic, western and different from the ""norm"". Check it out."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"On our last day in Santa Barbara my husband did a search on Google for  interesting  place to visit, he randomly picked this place for a brunch, we took our four kids with us not knowing what to expect. I loved the place, its so cute away from the big building and busy streets, its cold down here in winter so make sure you have something warm.
We were seated by the fire so that was great, the place is simple and rustic but that what its suppose to be and I loved that about this place, you are surrounded by the forest tucked inside the little house. 
The food: is huge if you don't have much appetite make sure you share your meal with someone or have a box to go, I think the price is great here even my 14 years old daughter pointed that out.
I have their BBQ pork rib, wow that was one of the best I have had, fell off the bones and very moist, the salad that come with the dishes were great  we had the lingonberry  vinaigrette with it and that was great choice the potatoes salad is well prepared, also the french fires are very fresh, my  husband and the 3 kids all had the burgers there was nothing left on any of the plate even though I had to cut that burger in half for my daughter for her  to be able to eat it because it is so huge.
I will come back again if I ever visit  the area again next time."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I enjoy going to new places and feel welcome... Hidden in the woods you will find a yummy bar, music and a very yummy tri-tip sandwich... 
Girls trip last stop ....After our last stop the only place i wanted to be was home, one of the girls read that this place had a good trip tip sandwich so since it was on the way back home we decided to take a left to find this place everyone was raving about.
the chill of the mountain the live band playing  birds chirping and the people so friendly was by far the best.
Had a cocktail at the cute bar with a trip tip sandwich. just wish we had more time here. Will be back with my family for sure.here are a few pictures.."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Looks like it was made by Universal Studios. At night you can hear the frogs and crickets chirping. On the weekends they play live music. It is both a bar and a restaurant but they are in 2 different buildings adjacent to each other. 

It's worth stopping by if you are in the area but don't go out of your way for it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We have had so much fun visiting Santa Barbara, but our highlight was visiting the Cold Spring Tavern. We decided to go up for a late dinner, and will never regret our decision. Everything, from the delicious homemade bread and butter, appetizer platter, to the desserts were sooooo delicious!! We ordered the surf and turf, tri-tip sandwich and pork chop. The meals included the bread, large salads or soup or their yummy homemade chili, and starch. My family are big eaters and were so hungry, but we could not finish, and ended up with two containers of leftovers! But I'd like to save the highlight for last, the ambience, and Marcos, our waiter. He was so personable, knowledgeable and fun!  If you ever go there, tell him the Hawaiians sent you from Yelp, and give him our fond aloha."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Bikers, hipsters, and travelers, rejoice - this little restaurant in the middle of nowheresville will provide you with the sustenance you need to ride on!

This review is only for the outdoor bbq they have ONLY on weekends; can't review the actual restaurant since we didn't eat inside.  After a series of windy roads, we were lucky to score a parking spot right in front of the restaurant.  But note that parking is scarce and several people had to park along the sides of the road leading to the restaurant (similar to how they do for popular hikes).  After arriving, you already sense the cool atmosphere and diversity of people making the pitstop here.

To start, you just go up to the front table, pay for a ticket/voucher and proceed to the giant bearded man cutting tri tip (adds a certain level of authenticity, no?).  He takes your ticket and slaps some juicy tri tip on some toasted sandwich buns and hands it to you.  You slather some au jus, horseradish mustard (?), bbq sauce, and/or some pico de gallo on your sandwich and have yourself a taste of heaven itself.  One of the best tri tip sandwiches I've ever had - juicy, tender, and cooked just right.  And then...I had some of my friends' onion rings.  Not just one of the best...but actually THE best onion rings I've ever had.  The batter they used seemed different from the ones you typically eat out at other places and adds a unique texture and taste to them.  And the portion was giant.   

The tri tip sandwich was $10 and the onion rings were $9; recommend getting both when you visit this ""hidden"" gem."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great place. The location is hard to beat, in the hills, lots of greenery, a truly unique spot and great for photos, drinks, a bite to eat, and live music. Lots of motorcycles, too. Try tip sandwiches are pretty good as well!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I was very very excited to try this place. 
After all the hype, and my boyfriend had been working in the area and said it looked really cool I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew it got VERY busy there. 

He wasn't wrong. This place gets 5 stars for atmosphere and decor. Lots of cool things visually and it's very cozy but doesn't feel claustrophobic. 

It was EXTREMELY busy the weekend we chose to stop. We had tried stopping by the previous evening but the line of cars stretched a literal mile. 
 We decided to just see what we could get and wait for a bit. 
The line was very long going in the door so I didn't think we would get a table at all but I found that the line went quick because most people were getting onion rings (the line raved about them) 
  We asked for a table for two and we were sat at a cute little half table by the window. 
Unfortunately it took a long time to be served our food, we did have drinks though, it was approx. an hour- but our waiter was very kind and did his very best. Everyone was clearing running around and no one was slacking. 
The coffee was good and I found the time passed pleasantly because we had a lot to look at and read about the history of the area. 
When we received our food it was all very good, nothing that I can quite rave about but I'll definitely have to try some of their other things. 
 Oh! and the onion rings WERE very good. Especially with the hidden valley ranch. 
Paxton (our server) made our dinner very pleasant and acknowledged that our wait time was too long and he took care of it all. 
Because of him, we will definitely be back again."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I live in Wyoming, but I'm dying to go there someday.
I went to UCSB back in 1965, but haven't been back in years.
Maybe next year, if I'm lucky."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,No frills but delicious steaks and ribs it's a must stop if you're up for a drive through the mountains.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Cool and rustic joint that's really more for the experience than anything else. It's way up in the mountain and has a very cool vibe. We went for the tri tip and while it's pretty good it's not mind blowing bbq. On a sunny day though it's super nice to get a beer outside and enjoy the music.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The food was so delicious. We had the tri tip sandwich pull pork sandwich and chili fries.  
 The chili fries were perfect because the fries were crispy and did not get soggy while swimming in the all that chili and cheese. The chili was fresh and so flavorful and I might have to admit I have not had better. As a virgin would say losing her virginity lol jk
The atmosphere was not only beautiful but so claming. The Brambles were playing...I have to say the live entertainment was unique and not replicable. The prices were super decent. 4.50 for a beer and around 8.50 for mixed drink. Beautiful views that is for sure and the people were super friendly."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We had a lovely after-graduation lunch here in June. Good and interesting food, friendly service, what a great location!  

Its nice to go to a place with a little history to it, and floors that aren't even."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Food and experience are awesome.

Get the chili... you won't be disappointed. 

Only drawback is that you might have to wait (for what seems like an eternity) for a table. BUT the good thing is that there is a bar, and depending on the time of day, you can eat a sandwich made fresh out back while you wait!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is such a gem! The atmosphere, the scenery surrounding the place, and my God, THE FOOD! Worth the drive, wherever you are driving from."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Incredibile place! Authentic old restaurant have more than 200 years! Very good and for drink every is local! I love this place, every time when I come in Santa Barbara for sure is my lunch place!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"When tourist buses full of senior citizens roll through, its hard to feel like you've just found something special..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The best thing about this place is the rickety building and cold beer. We go here each time we go to Santa Barbara. It's nice being on the old stagecoach road.
The food though is ok. The tri tip sandwich and onion rings were good. But the country fried steak was just ok. We missed the music because we were just passing through. Service was ok but it was awfully hard to get the bill.
If you get a chance stop by there if for no other reason than the history of the place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We stopped here during a getaway in Santa Barbara.  What a find!  As someone who used to work in the service trade I was highly impressed with the service, food, low wait time and their ability to keep everything moving.  

If I'm in the area again and have time for a leisurely lunch I will be back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Such a hidden gem.  One of my friends who lives in the area took me there years ago.  Then I forgot about it till I saw a pic of the place again on IG.  It's become one of my favorites in the area.  

The tri-tip they cook out in the open is amazing.  Wash is down with some beers and you're golden.  They also have bands that play outside.   Not sure of the schedule.  Overall very nice vibes.  

Enjoy!!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,What a cool hidden treasure of the 154. If your into California history and good food this is your place. Save room for dessert.. the pecan pie is off the charts!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great meal, great road. We had dinner for 7, and each of us had something great; there were even vegetarian options for those of us who didn't eat meat. But for those of us that DID...what a treat. Apparently they sometimes serve bear, but all we had was bison, rabbit, wild boar, wild game chili and venison sausage. All served along the original pass route, next to a great open air bar, that didn't exactly stay open late, but did have a great atmosphere."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A Rustic Mountian surprise, down in the Valley. What a cool place. If you are a first timer, you might be a bit thrown off, but trust me, it will grow on you. A great Sunday afternoon Bar haunt, for what I think are some of the BEST Bloody Marys, and ""OMG"" OVER the top, Tri-Tip sandwich. Topped with that dang secret BBQ sauce. I dream of that sandwich often, Fun, off the beaten friendly place, with live band inside, I don't think you could go wrong."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My husband took me for my birthday lunch on a VERY rainy day. It was SO cozy inside, with a fire going in the fireplace...I really felt like we had just stepped back into 'Gunsmoke' times.
It was a PERFECT day for chili, so we started with that, then onto BBQ beef sandwich for me, and their famous tri-tip for my husband. I was presented with a piece of lemon cheesecake (with a candle on it ! ) for dessert...it was PERFECT !! Everything was delicious !!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,It is indeed very American. The sandwich smells better than eating it. It is a big treat for yourself if you want meat.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Historical and fun. Great ribs and tri-tip!! Live music on the weekends. I love the ambiance here. 
Was able to have an 18 person company lunch here no problem. 

A must see for locals and travelers."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Quirky fact: This was recommended by Iron Chef Cat Cora on ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate.""

Pros: Dog-friendly except on Sundays when it's extremely busy and they don't want the dogs fighting over any accidentally dropped food. Outdoor smoked tri-tip sandwich. Gamey meats in the restaurant. Plenty of seating area. Live music. Actual tavern that stagecoaches used to stop at to refuel themselves at. Very eclectic clientele. You know it's a really great place if locals bring generations back.

Cons: Up in the mountains and hard to find if you don't know where you're going. Definitely directions needed.

Tip: Go during lunch when they do their outdoor smoking."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The location and ambiance alone are amazing and definitely worth the 25 minute drive or so from Santa Barbara! The excellent food, live music, and drinks just make it even better!! Visiting Cold Spring Tavern is like stepping back in time and some of the menu offerings are as unique as the decor. They serve Rabbit loin for goodness sakes! Not that I had that of course, but it was interesting nonetheless.
The complimentary warm, fresh whole wheat and molasses bread was to die for! 

If you're looking for an unusual and magical place to spend an evening, have a meal, or some drinks and a dance, and you don't mind venturing a little off the beaten path, you've gotta check out Cold Spring Tavern in the Santa Yñez mountains above Santa Barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This isn't just a good meal, it's a great experience. The staff is welcoming and helpful, and the food is some of the best we've had in Southern California. It's a really unique place to visit, too! 

We definitely plan to return for special occasions like Valentine's Day or Thanksgiving. The prices are beyond reasonable for a nice meal in California, and the restaurant's history as an old stagecoach stop dates back over 100 years."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Hidden surprise indeed.  We went here originally for the bbq sandwiches, but couldn't make it with our schedule for the day, so instead we went for their brunch.  The country fried steak and eggs was REALLY delicious.  I'm talking the first bite made me wonder if my taste buds really just tasted something so good.  My friend is a food critic by nature and seeing his face light up when he took a bite out of it affirmed me that I wasn't crazy.  He said ""wow I could drink that gravy"" which was my sentiments exactly.  Maybe it was because we just came from ""roughin' it"" and camping, but the OJ was pretty darn good too :)  I love the atmosphere, I love that it's hidden, and I love that there are bikers that come here.  We will be back for what we originally planned for...bbq sandwiches!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,We've been to Cold Spring Tavern 3 times now. It is an old stage coach stop in between Santa Barbara and Solvang with a cool vibe and great food. The chili sampler is amazing and I personally love the grilled vegteble salad. They have a bar you can hang out in while you wait for a table and last time we were there they had live music. Definitely worth the pit stop if you're in the area!!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Place is very cool to visit. Yes it's a bit off the road, but worth visiting. They do have a delicious Chile Verde Chili"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Donna the manager is quite possibly the best restaurant manager in the Santa Barbara area.  So impressed with her knowledge and she was a delight to engage with in such a beautiful restaurant.  Donna, your friendly attitude really went a long way. Thank you thank you thank you. 6 stars"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We've heard of this place for years and finally got a chance to eat here. Let's just say the ambiance was great the comfort and service to exceptional and the food was delicious. I would've been happy with just the chili and a baked potato, but the tri tip was great. My wife ordered a salad which was fresh and tasty (great ranch). My son had a buffalo burger that became his favorite burger all time. We will be back soon!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I came here for lunch last Sunday with my family and friends and we were seated right away, which I was very happy about considering how many people were outside. We were seated by this really nice hostess but man was our server a complete douche. He was a Hispanic man and asked us if we were ready to order without introducing himself. I asked him if it was possible to upgrade my fries to chili cheese fries and, with an attitude, said ""I can just give you a bowl of chili but I can't put it on the fries"". I thought that was weird but whatever. I let it go. Later, we asked for a refill on our water and he just placed a pitcher on the table without pouring it for us. Who does that? Strike 2. Then, my boyfriend picked up two shirts from the front to pay for it after we eat. The rude ass worker put the shirts on the same tab as the food and we asked him if he could take it out because he's going to pay for it separate at the cashier. With an attitude, he left and came back with a separate receipt and said ""where's the guy."" We told him he's already at the front paying for it like we told him before but I guess he didn't believe us so he went there himself and made my boyfriend show him the receipt. 

Honestly, the food was really good. The chili cheese fries were bomb and the tri tip sandwich was delicious. We could have had any other server and it would have been perfect. I didn't get his name but he was the only Hispanic middle aged server and damn was he something else. If you ever check this place out and he's your server, immediately ask for a different one. We noticed the other servers and they all seemed really nice. I don't know if it was because we were young or what but that service was completely unacceptable."

To be fair, it's a great hangout and people watching spot. Entertainment abounds here! Crowd pleasing bands perform so you can line dance and shake your booty or co-mingle outside. Beer selection is good. Figueroa Mountain Brew on tap? Yes please!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This off-the-beaten path location is a must see.  Dating back to the late 1800s, this old stagecoach stop has become a fantastic restaurant with both conventional and unusual fare (if you consider braised rabbit loin and wild boar unusual).  Baking their own bread on site, using water from the many artesian spring wells on the 50 acre site, they set a high standard for dining in historical places.  The servers are friendly, knowledgeable and more than happy to answer questions about the origins of the place.  A picture of Audrey, the last of the original family owners, hangs above the bar in the Front Room, and they say her presence can be felt around the place at times, especially since her favorite hat (seen in the picture) still hangs in the White Room.  The menu contains some great history about the place and you must absolutely walk about the grounds if lighting permits.  See the old Ojai jail, the bunkhouse where Chinese workers lived while carving the road from the mountain, and visit several small kitschy shoppes as well.  Definitely a destination - the interiors and floors are original and give a flavor for life more than a hundred years ago, although I dare say the food has improved significantly!  Be sure to say hello to Jay (who makes a mean mojito, I can assure you) and Amanda - she is also a martial arts instructor so if you want some lessons, just ask!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,We rode up on the motorcycles which was a nice scenic route. My burger was good and hubby liked the french dip. The Apple horseradish sauce on french dip was not too overpowering gave it a nice flavor.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We heard about this place on TV, so we knew we wanted to try this place as well. It was on ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"", and Cat Cora (who happens to be from Santa Barbara) was the one who claimed that this was the best tri-tip sandwich she ever ate. So of course we had to try it. We went from a day at the beach to a short mountain drive, and found a super quaint little cabin-area with tons of people, music, and smells of delicious bbq-ed tri-tip. We went into the bar and bought some tickets for the tri-tip sandwiches, and walked over to the side where they were bbq-ing.

We saw the buns being toasted and ready for some tri-tip.  They had homemade sauces that they make daily, so every day they taste a little bit different - salsa, horseradish sauce, and bbq sauce.

The guy serving up the sandwiches INSISTED that I try the horseradish sauce. I told him I didn't really like horseradish and he gave me this glare of death, dipped a juicy piece of meat into the sauce, and handed it to me. I couldn't refuse a free piece of delicious beef, so I took it and ate it. It was DELICIOUS. If I go back here, I will definitely get that sauce again. It was my favorite, and I don't even like horseradish. Really. No joke. The sandwiches were amazing - I only wish that I lived closer so that I could get this more often.

Truly was the best Tri-Tip Sandwich - even beats the place in SLO if you've ever been there..."

Such a great team of folks caring for this place and ensuring their guests have the best experience. Everyone at the place truly cared. I had this great conversation about the Cold Springs Tavern history with Violet, the shop keeper. If you want to talk ""shop"", you must seek her out. As far as food, we had the best Onion Rings we have ever had. I've also never had wild game chili and thought I'd give it a try. It was delicious!!  We wish we had room for dessert and more food because it all looked so good. We'll be back for sure!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Off the beaten path, but worth finding!  Quite the drive up a long and winding two lane road cutting through a mountain if you're coming from Santa Barbara.  You'll definitely need GPS to find it, but beware that cell service will be spotty throughout.  Parking sucks and you'll likely have to create your own spot along the side of the road on a gravel/dirt patch dangerously close to one or more of the following: mountain, winding road with blind spots, and/or cliff.  Definitely not easy!  Cool historical spot nestled in the wilderness.  You almost feel like you've gone back in time.  Friendly and fast service.  However, a lot of the clientele are bikers who tend to have foul mouths and not take COVID seriously (at least during our experience).

I went with their tri-tip sandwich and fries.  The tri-tip was just bread and the meat!  Super dry.  The menu said it came with sauce, but that definitely wasn't the case for me.  I had to wave down the server and ask if I was missing something.  As a result, I was given three side sauces to use: BBQ, apple horse radish, and a sweet salsa.  Maybe ask for all three when you go?  It was actually nice to be able to sample them.  However, I was surprised I was given such a bland sandwich to start.  Fries hit the spot, though!  They had a great seasoning.  For a drink, I went with Adelaide's Lemonade, which is a whiskey drink.  Loved it, but a bit on the pricey side (I'd argue that for their menu in general, but it's probably expensive to get all the food/drink out there).  Nice and sweet - masked the alcohol almost entirely!  Perfect for a hot day."

Lunch and dinner are equally delicious !!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"It'd been a helluva long day driving the windy, narrow roads of the Santa Ynez visiting the many wineries and dodging large California Brown Tarantulas crawling slowly across the roads. Dusk had already settled over the dusty scrub oak hills by the time we traversed the Cold Springs Bridge and pulled into the empty, dirt parking space of the tavern. Jon thought we'd crossed into a time warp and entered the days of the Ponderosa while investigating the rustic cabins and ancient machinery thrown willy-nilly about the area but no, it was still 2009 and only a few miles back to Santa Barbara.

There have been no changes over the years I've been coming here and that's a good thing. Only the people change and our bartendress could have been my daughter if I didn't know her tattoos well enough. Cold Springs continues the tradition of offering as much fine game as regular dinner selections and the rustic bar offers good local wines as well as the stronger stuff that bikers and surf chicks like. I had her pour me a Maker's Mark and Coke since I'd been the DD through all those wineries and Jon was half lit already. We took our seats beneath a deer or some other furry beast and let the roaring fire warm our bones, the Maker's Mark hitting the spot. I had two.

We had the appetizer plate (prawns, arti hearts & venison sausage), shared the beef chili & chicken soup, special elk chops, medallions of rabbit, and finished dinner with a Jack Daniels Pecan Pie. All of it was delicious and prepared perfectly and prices haven't risen all that much either. I haven't weighed this much since I was married. And I thought chemotherapy would make me a scarecrow, haha. Fuck that. We'd been the first diners of the night but by the time we left, it was packed. The popularity of the place hasn't diminished an iota and I believe I found my initials some boy had carved into the antique wooden bench we occupied so many years ago. Nothing changes here, thankfully. 

P.S., The sun's last hurrah painted a glowing orange against the green metal sides of the Cold Spring Bridge and I stopped to snap a few pictures not knowing that this happy sunset was balanced in sadness of a woman who jumped from this same span that very morning. ""Suicide Bridge"" has claimed 52 (USA Today, Oct 12, 2009, 3A). Such a beautiful setting for such a tragic end."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The Cold Spring Tavern has been feeding travelers and diners for 154 years. Fairly recently, I had an opportunity to eat here.  I was informed about this place before my last trip to Solvang, but it wasn't open on my first pass, so I skipped it and went onto the rest of my adventure. But today, I caught it just around 11:30, so it was early still, and there was parking in their lot.  The lot was small, cramped and off-road-y. But my camaro now sat on the very same ground stage-coaches sat well over a hundred years ago. Nostalgia makes anything better.
    After parking and walking over to the place, It looked at the antiquated place, actually, this place was way past antiquated, it looked old. A plaque was sunk into a boulder by the front door.  It told of the travelers and 'Mudwagons' that would pass by and stop here for the mid-day-meal back in 1886. The door was cut in half, and the lower half was shut across the threshold. The top half of the door was hanging open, and the wonderful aroma of wood-smoke wafted out to greet my nose. It lured me in to grab a seat by the window. As I stepped in, the floor creaked with age. This place seemed just as old in here as it did outside. I sat down beneath a stuffed deer's head, it was like a TGI Fridays, but instead of the 'Sportsy crap' hanging on the walls, it was '1886 period crap'.  A woodstove warmed this room, and I picked up a menu after gazing about the place.
   The menu was expansive, with more than a few of god's creatures to choose from.  Knowing I'd be eating a Casino buffet in just a little bit,  I was upset I could only experience a bit of it.  I settled upon the Cold Spring Chili Fries as an appetizer, it featured their 'famous chili' on top of the fries.  I was content with a cold glass of water, but it appeared their beverage list contained quite a long list of beers, wines & booze. The fries arrived in just a few minutes, and they were wonderful. The fries were crunchy, the chili was hot, and the cheese was stringy. A mound of onions were sprinkled atop the pile for good measure. There were a few fries on the outer perimeter I could pick up with fingers, but I was using a fork after eating all of the 'clean fries' I could grab. The chili was indeed quite good. Large chunks of meat I had to spear with a fork, as the chili soaked fries could not carry their weight.
    I paid my tab ($7ish) picked up some post cards, and returned to my car, where I carefully backed out of the lot, and returned to my adventure, already in progress."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I have always wanted to experience CST (Cold Spring Tavern) for Valentine's Day dinner, ever since I moved up here, (SYV) four years ago. I called and made our reservation in December because I knew they would book out early, they always do. Got them in, and then they emailed me back to confirm.  Which I appreciated more than a phone call.  With my business, email is the best way to reach me.  In any case Thursday night was a night to remember, and definitely a great story.  We got there right at 7pm and we were seated right away, I was excited because I finally got to sit in the room with the big window, and at a big 4 top table, overlooking the other diners.  Right away the scene of the room before us was captivating, there was a couple immediately to the left of our table who couldn't keep their hands off each other, a nearing empty bottle of wine on the table, and in between giggles, she pants, ""this is the most sexually charged dinner,"" and now I'm giggling because its Valentine's day after all, I would hope if you were taken, you were doing the same...  and if not, same applies. In any case, the rest of the blue haired diners were exchanging judging mc judgerson glances to the naughty table to our left. And I get it, there was definitely an age gap, and different standards.  So I grabbed an ""awesome"" card, and went over to them, and told them, I thought they were adorable and that, I hope my husband and I are just as loving when we are 30 yrs older... they smiled we introduced ourselves. They laughed and thanked me for the card. And immediately the gnarly tension was lifted, and the couple calmed down on their PDAs.  We had Marcos for our server.  He was hands down professional and super calm when dealing with all the challenges that arose later in the evening. He also smelled really good, for as much running around he did. He had all of the tables in our room, and not sure how many more outside in the other areas. But there were,  8 tables in our little room alone, I hope I'm painting a picture, it was slammed, but still romantic and cozy.  I ordered the lobster tail and mushroom risotto ($60), my husband ordered the duck ($48), and our friend settled into her 10oz of filet mignon ($50) each entree came with a choice of butternut squash soup or salad, and a dessert large enough to share, which was a frosted sugar cookie, a fruit custard tart with market fresh berries, and a chocolate covered strawberry, which by the way were amazing. My husband got the scallop potatoes, so I could try them, because mine came with risotto, I didn't get an additional side. Best scalloped potatoes I've ever eaten anywhere.  During our dining  experience a young skunk walked by was spooked and 'pepe le pewed' all over.  Now it got interesting because one woman to our left, (different couple, than the smoochers) got up out of her chair so fast she knocked glasses over, made a scene about the smell and stormed out of the room.  Her husband begrudgingly followed behind her.  The kitchen was next to us, so we started to smell delicious garlic, shallots and butter, over the already skunky smell.  It was such an interesting smell, and thing to witness.   But after about 20 mins the only thing we COULD smell was delicious food being prepared and the skunk smell diminished.  To me I wasn't bothered by the skunk because 
A) we were in the woods in HIS backyard
B) we were in a historical landmark bldg (zero insulation)
C) it's Valentine's Day, and now we have an adventurous story to share later...  

Thank you Cold Spring Tavern for an unforgettable evening and you exceeded my expectations, above and beyond excellent meal. Also the long stemmed rose was a really nice touch."

She loved the quiche, and the crust was amazing. Potato salad is good too. 

Atmosphere is great, inside of a rustic cabin, originally a stagecoach stop in the mountains. Not the most comfortable seats, but that's a minor complaint.

Bonus: We saw a bear digging for grub on the hill just above the Tavern.

We had a Sunday breakfast here last year, and it was just as good, with huge portions. Be sure to beat the Sunday afternoon rush. You may have to hike a mile or two from the Tavern."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Came up to SB for the weekend to meet up with a friend who moved there recently. She suggested Cold Spring Tavern, because I had mentioned I had yet to eat any Tri-tip a centerpiece of Santa Maria style barbecue.

Cold Spring is pretty high up in the hills and don't be surprised if your cell reception falls off, but once you turn onto Stagecoach Road, it's up the hill and you can't miss the crowd of vehicles, especially on the weekend. 

If you are going to go on a weekend like we did it might be better if you have a reservation. We didn't have one and we ended up waiting for about 25 minutes which wasn't too bad, but when it's hot and with not much shade it can be rough.

I would love to see this place in non COVID circumstances. They had these wood grills out, but there were some more just sitting idle. I'm sure when they go full capacity the smell of roasting meats fills the area.

I got the tri-tip sandwich and my friend wanted to split Onion rings. Our server was cool with bringing extra baskets and dipping sauces. The batter was light and the ranch dressing was a good match with it, not as heavy as I thought it would be.

I almost went with something else instead of the tri-tip. The venison sandwich and buffalo burger were also pretty tempting. I'm glad I got the tri-tip though and their house BBQ sauce. The sauce was a little on the sweeter side for me but it went well with their sandwich."

We got to the tavern and it was first come first serve seating but came quick, the server was on top of things and got our drinks right away. I ordered the chili sampler which consists of a cup of Chile Verde, game chili, house chili and a tortilla, it was beyond filling and all three were phenomenal.

They don't take reservation, first come first serve. 

The Service: Service is okay but the food preparation is slooooow! At least 20 minutes wait to get our sandwiches. 

The Food: LOVE their tri-tip sandwich! The meat is so tender and flavorful. Mixed with their homemade BBQ sauce. After the first bite.... can't stop!! Also, they grilled the buns. A little bit crispy outside but soft bread inside. Perfect texture! 

The Parking: Sunday lunch time.... CROWDED!! Park on the street, few minutes walk to the restaurant. 

Live band on the weekends, lots of people choose to eat in the patio area. They purchase food tickets at the bar then wait in line to pick up their sandwiches."

This year, our waitress wAs mostly MIA, we all ordered our meals, when the kitchen brought it out, they gave my husband and nephew the wild bore, they ordered the elk.  Well apparently they were sold out and didn't let us know and thought that subbing the bore would be ok.  My husband does not not like bore so he declined the meal...my nephew decided to eat it since we all had our dinners in front of us and it would be another 15-20 minutes to get something else made.  Fast forward to the check coming, some bald headed dude asked if there was a problem, we said yes, why were we charged for for the substitute meal, that my nephew got, he said ""well he ate it"", but I'll take a glass of wine off your tab. Ok, well needless to say, my husband didn't have dinner, my nephew ate what he got put in front of him, and we didn't order desert.

I would recommend calling ahead and make reservations. What I like to do is make reservations and show up about an hour early just to hangout at the bar next door. It is still part of Cold Spring Tavern, it's just a separate little building about 30 feet away from the restaurant. They play live music in the bar during weekends. 

In the restaurant, there are a couple separate rooms, this was like a house way back in the days and now every room is a dining area. There are two or three fire places inside the restaurant to keep you warm during winter and romantic the rest of the year. 

Prices per plate are about $5 more than you would pay on average anywhere else. Food choices are all good, I have yet to come across something I didn't like on the menu. Overall this place is amazing, food is delicious, service is VERY GOOD, silverwear nice and clean, interior of building is very outdated BUT that's what makes is extremely unique. 

I definitely recommend this place, definitely worth my long drive from out of town.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is the perfect spot for lunch on your way up to wine country! 

A few friends had recommend Tavern for their BBQ. You pull up and there is smoke coming off the back grills. If it's a nice day, definitely sit outside on one of the picnic tables. You order inside and they'll bring out your order. We had several things: the venison sandwich, the pulled pork sandwich, the black chili, the house chili and the onion rings. The onion rings were awesome. They were think and juicy and came with ranch for dipping. 

The venison sandwich was the biggest disappointment. It was dry and kind of chewy. The pulled pork was good and even better when I loaded it with extra BBQ sauce. The house chili was pretty tasty as well, but if you only choose one side, definitely go for the onion rings. 

The wine glasses were a bit dirty, but the whole place has that dusty, rustic feel, so if you are wearing all white and are a clean freak, you probably want to avoid this place. 

Overall a cool experience. They play live music on weekends starting at 2pm."

The chili was beautiful, mild smoke, spiced, spicy. Delicious. The tortilla, great to me, met my wife's standards she she's used to senoran style tortillas. Beautiful meal"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"How could I drive right past a place an Iron Chef has said is a must visit for a ""best of"" tri-tip sandwich? Well, I can't.
Cold Spring Tavern is actually a place that has been on my radar for some time now. It is a little ramshackle of a place that seems to want to be hidden. There is a bar, restaurant, gift shop of sorts and the fabled ""Santa Maria style"" BBQ setup between the bar and restaurant.
So this is how I did it: 
- First, please remember that they only do the tri-tip on Sundays!
- Buy beer and tickets for the tri-tip sandwich in the bar.
- Walk around the bar and swap the tickets for the sandwich. 
- Add the appropriate toppings (I went with the Apple Horseradish sauce and the Salsa - which was recommended by the cook).
-  Sit down and dig in!
I know everyone else is saying it, but this really is something special! I ate my delicious sandwich, drank an ice cold beer and listened to a live band belt out some Grateful Dead. Is that a perfect Sunday afternoon or what? 
Expect a lot of people."

I have made many trips to Solvang taking overseas visitors & wish I had known about this place before - will definitely add it to my list of places to take guests in the future. I want to try their dinner & lunchtime menus too. Highly recommend
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"The atmosphere alone grants this hideaway three stars. Set in the recesses of a small canyon just  below interstate 154 and  the summit of the Santa Ynez's gaze over the city of Santa Barbara, this biker bar doubles as a steakhouse for those brave enough to parallel park there hybrids next to a row of Harley's. 

This boldness pays off though when you realize you're actually entering a REAL tavern, complete with swinging doors, dark wood furnishings, and a hearth, casting spirals of firelight into dark corners. The food is authentic too, with venison and other game meats proliferating the menu. But as real as the food may be, so are the prices ($8 for a hamburger, uh). 

They've also got a healthy selection of beers and wines to choose from, and while it may not be the Hitching Post in terms of varietals to choose from, they do the Santa Barbara wineries justice.

Only 20 minutes off the 101, it's a great lunch stop if you're in the Santa Barbra area or touring the wine country on the other side of the pass."

You can go into the ""cabin/restaurant"" and pay for the sandwich ...and  pick it up outside & eat at the picnic tables or you can eat inside the cabin. I'm not sure how much if you eat outside but inside the Tri-Tip is $13.95 (?)...it's just a few pieces of meat on a bun...& it comes with one side. Not the softest meat but not tough either. They also have an array of other sandwiches all at $10.50. My wife is a veggie so she ordered a grilled cheese...NOT GOOD!!! They used Texas Toast...about an inch each side but only put one slice of cheese and some salsa on it...the cheese disintegrated so she just picked on the bread...stay away from it!

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Very cute little place and I can see where it can be very romantic, however we arrived around 8:30am on Mother's Day for my ""special"" breakfast.  The wait staff, which appeared to be the owners, acted like they just didn't want to be there and they didn't want others to be there.  I ordered the omelet and asked for a side of fruit.  The waitress (owner?) said she could give me some sliced pineapple and oranges, ""very nice"" I responded with a thank you.  She talked my husband and I out of the side of biscuits and gravy.  I'm not sure why, as that is what we came for.  My dish came with it but it was only one biscuit, so my husband and I had to share one buscuit.  When our plates came my omelet was over cooked and greasy, not at all fluffy.  I ate too bites and left the rest.  The fruit never came and we asked for more biscuits and we were ignored.  The waitress never came back to refill our coffee and we had to ask for the check.  The person who cleared our plates didn't even ask why we didn't finish our meals.  Seemed like they didn't care.  Before leaving we used the bathroom facilities and the woman's toilet was plugged up, that early in the morning.  I saw the owner out side and he had this scowl on his face.  We felt like we wasted our money and it ruined my Mother's Day!  I was so very disappointed as all the reviews are good and I really wanted a nice romantic Mother's Day breakfast.  We will NOT return."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Located on the old stagecoach route - aptly named ""Stagecoach Road"", this stopover used to be known as the ""Cold Spring Relay Station"". It relayed food and water to both two- and four-legged travelers on the long journey between Northern and Southern California. This is one of those places that could rudely slap down mediocre food - and a hefty tab - on your table and remain in business based solely on its isolated location and historic reputation. But, I'm certain that the owner we met (tableside) would never settle for that. The buffalo burger (mine) and the barbecued tri-tip sandwich (friend's) would lure me back all the way from San Diego. (Although my burger was good, I had a serious case of tri-tip envy...this is definitely the house specialty and mustn't be missed.) We joined the hundreds of other long gone travelers and left refreshed."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,A smart place to come & see live music. I usually get a tri tip san which on bbq days or I like to eat in the fine dinning section & get something rugged like rattlesnake ravioli etc.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What haven't I already painted about the Cold Spring Tavern? It's been the location and subject matter of so many a brushstroke. 

A women's volleyball team once reunited there only to proposition Scottie and I to get into their van and party. We were hardly twenty-five, them in their forties. We declined, but will forever wonder: with what gusto would they barrel down the 154 into Santa Inez Valley? Would they gamble at that casino at the edge of Solvang, or dunk their heads in more booze and bob for apples?

Sundays at Cold Spring Tavern are filled with forest and dappling light, the Cold Canyon Arc Bridge looming in serene wooded bliss. The whispering stream of the spring. A stand-up bass, perpetually slapped by a bearded hippie. Motorcycles. Tri-tip. The wish that old California will live on through the muck of artificial intelligence and denim shorts. I look at the old jail cell, the eighteenth-century Cold Spring Tavern structures in general, and wonder what becomes of our  experience post phone app dog filter. We are jailed, interacting through the barrier of digital walls. I often want to touch someone's arm, and have them look at me, like, really see me, and have that be that. 

It's what happens to me in the Cold Spring Tavern, usually a nudge from Scottie; a cowgirl shorty here, a nice-looking steak there. What more California thing can one find but a tri-tip topped with salsa, the jalapenos lush with seeds? Then a horseradish sauce. A red sauce. A cup of beer. Scottie shivering slightly in the shaded wood, in his usual t-shirt and jeans. We never bring a jacket. 

He says, ""Cheers, old boy,"" and we swig our whiskey rocks. Our large cups of beer. We are glowing in the twilight that seems permanent in Santa Barbara mountains for Santa Barbara is a biblical site of tri-tip and beach. Of grape leaves and olive oil and the Cold Spring Tavern. She really is the most beautiful. 

Scottie loves Her too. It's why we've continued to drive here week after week, the hour and a half from LA a gleeful sing song journey. We keep old California in our back pockets this way and don't care if we're the last people in the world to romanticize the smell of linseed or hickory. We dip into Santa Barbara, an artist and his manager, our bellies occupied by meat and Fritos. Our souls full of dappled light."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Such a cool place.  Was told about it several years ago and, although it was hard to find, it was worth the experience.  Since then, I've been stopping there just about every time I go up that way.

It's a relaxing place off the beaten path.... lots of motorcycles.  It's been increasing in popularity since I first started going, so it doesn't have the quaint quietness as before... but that's still there underneath it all.  A nice creek flowing, birds chirping, rock n roll playing.  

The venison sausage stuffed mushrooms are what kept me coming back at first.... but their famous chili is a great meal too, it's got nice flavor and is perfect with a cold chilled beer (I rarely have beer, but some occassions call for it).  The appetizers for two are super yummy!!  As are the burgers and salads.  Never had dinner there, always lunch (and once for breakfast, very tasty too).

If for no other reason, it's a great place to stop and rest when driving up towards wine country, Solvang or Pismo (or Morro Bay, which is where I'm usually headed).  Cute little cabin tucked in the hills off the hustle of the freeway below.  Pretty neat joint.

Stop and check it out... drive slow and watch for bikers

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I am perhaps more shocked at the eater website for recommending this restaurant and some others in town that were both disappointment. See my Blackbird review for the other.   The restaurant's allure perhaps is more about the ambience on top of a small mountains and the rustic history and surroundings than the actual food. The wait staff is genial and attentive coming to ask us at least 4 times how we were doing. 

We had their ""famous"" try tip sandwich and the popular buffalo burger. The tri tip had good texture and a decent barbecue sauce and fries to go on the side.  But it was more just good than special.  The buffalo burger tasted.......well like a normal well done burger in the backyard than anything else. We enjoyed our meal but it hardly warrants 4-5 star reviews. I would perhaps give it 4 stars if my non professional neighbor made it on a weekend barbecue. 

I think it's time to stop wasting our money in SB overall and just get a taco or in'n out or something."

Nothing else needs to be said about their food. 

Go up on a Sunday for the tri tip sandwich bbque. When you are in the bar, buying your ticket for your sandwich, ask for an order of onion rings. You will pick it up from the restaurant next to where they are serving the tri tip sandwiches outside.

What an amazing place! It's an old stagecoach stop, and retains all of the charm (and rickety wood construction) of its historic past.

Outside, a stream cascades down the rocks at the bottom of the canyon, and the building is surrounded by lush growth.

The restaurant is divided up into intimate rooms, with great mood lighting, and views of the woods.

Lunch offerings include salads and sandwiches and burgers. Both the chiliburger and venison steak sandwich were excellent, as were the accompanying fries and salad. Apparently the quiche is amazing, with a wonderful pastry crust, but the person before me got the last order!

It's about a 30 minute uphill drive from Santa Barbara, into the mountains.  If you're using a map be sure not to miss the turn onto Stagecoach..it'll come up rather quickly.

Upon arrival it seemed like there was a huge party going on.  Very festive atmosphere with a live band, tons of people drinking and dancing.  We went on a Sunday so it might have been a special for that day to have that kind of of festivity.  

You order the food and drinks at the bar...it can get rather crowded so be ready to wait in line.  They give you a ticket for the tri tip sandwich and you get those at the outdoor grill.  The tri tip sandwiches are pretty big and they have a table with BBQ sauce, horseradish, and salsa.  the BBQ sauce was sweet...and horseradish was not spicy...so I recommend adding those two.

The sandwich was freaking delicious.  So good....probably the best tri tip sandwich I've ever had.  Juicy, bread was soft, sauces complimented it very well....

I'll definitely be back when I'm in Santa Barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Two years ago my family abandoned our Thanksgiving tradition of dining and drinking all day with family and friends to build a new tradition around dining at Cold Spring Tavern. First of all, it's great that you can go out for Thanksgiving in your jeans! The super casual dress code suits us. Then, the atmosphere is rustic and cozy. Last year we sat in the room with the big fireplace and roasted, so we won't do that again!

Thanksgiving dinner starts with yummy breads (banana nut, poppyseed) and then goes to venison terrine and stuffed mushrooms. (I always order an Irish coffee, which is great!) Dinner is a choice of grilled salmon, smoked turkey or prime rib. There's stuffing, mashed taters, gravy and steamed veg. Dessert is a choice of bread pudding with bourbon (I think), pecan pie and pumpkin. The pecan is my favorite and is as good as those in my southern youth.

The dining experience takes around 2 hours and is wonderfully relaxing. Afterwards, our tradition includes hiking down the road underneath the Cold Spring Bridge, picking bay leaves from the surrounding trees to dry at home and then stopping by to boulder at Lizard's Mouth.

The leftovers are so plentiful that by the time we get home exploring, there's a full Thanksgiving dinner of leftovers, and we've enjoyed family time and some exercise. We love our new Cold Spring Tavern tradition, but book early! It's packed!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"For an establishment that has been around over 100 years, Cold Spring Tavern still manages to maintain a certain ""hidden gem"" appeal that is beyond charming. Whether that appeal is cultivated from the remote location stashed away in a mountain crevice, the unique and flavorful menus, or the antique architecture and atmosphere along with an ever-burning wood fire, you cannot help but feel cozy and comfortable. Once the awe of the classic and natural scenery has subsided, you are ready to experience the BEST reason to visit the tavern, the food of course! On our first experience we went for dinner, the menu was interesting and had variety, but small enough to ensure the care and time spent on each dish. After much deliberation, we decided to try the rack of lamb (with garlic mashed potatoes) and the rabbit tenderloin (with baked potato). The smell and plating alone immediately validates the trip there, then the taste WILL MAKE YOU GO BACK (we are personal witnesses). The lamb was quickly ranked among best meat I've ever tasted, and made me want to kiss the chef, the rabbit was also delicious and while a different taste from the norm, very much worth trying. The sides were perfect and noticeably NOT just a second thought to the main dishes! (**we also had a soup and chili that came with the entrées that I include in ""sides""). As I mentioned, after one experience we HAD to return for breakfast the next day, and lunch another. For breakfast we were both feeling a little nontraditional, and went for Huevos Rancheros and a breakfast burrito. Both simply amazing, the wild game chili and perfectly cooked eggs are a great way to wake up and a great reason to immediately take a nap after!  The breakfast burrito featured two highly noticeable highlights, the fluffy egg that served almost as a second tortilla keeping all the deliciousness wrapped inside, as well as some of the BEST guacamole I've ever tasted!! For lunch we went with the tri-tip sandwich and the venison steak sandwich, once again amazing! The tri-tip came with homemade bbq sauce and homemade apple horseradish that were good enough to bottle up and sell if they ever wanted to!  All in all, if you're ever around the Santa Barbra region, take the scenic drive in the mountains and treat yourself to this wonderful ""hidden gem""!"

This Tavern was built in 1886. Buggies and carriages use it as a rest stop during there travels. The place was filled with bikers. And surrounded by trees.

There was a bar, rest restaurant and sandwich stand that served stake sandwiches. 

If you are looking for authentic bikers gear this is the place to find it. There was tables of idioms with spikes, bandannas, and all sorts of hand made leather gear.

I ate at the restaurant with Al. it was a warm cozy place to eat. I like it a lot! The menu was filled with sandwiches, burgers, a couple salads and chili dishes.

I had the veggie salad with added chicken and dressing on the side. I was really good! It had romaine lettuce with eggplant, asparagus and squash. The chicken was very juice.

Al had a small salad and small bowl of chili with a tortilla. He was telling me how he just lost 35lbs. I could tell he was keeping his calories low by portioning.  

This was a great place to stop after riding 188 miles :)"

There are plenty of seatings outside and I kinda enjoyed sitting out in the sun and admiring the scenery with my sandwich. The drive up was a bit scary because it's just one narrow road up the mountain and there's no parking lots or anything, just find a spot along the road and park!

It also came with three different sauces - a medium red salsa, bbq sauce, and a horseradish mayo. The horseradish sauce was by far the crowd favorite, but all three were yummy.

i love that i can use mainstream media to find out about hidden gems like these but i hate coming here knowing its such a touristy spot, being one myself as well. LOL

find this spot coming up the mountain through winding roads, you'll find that they have super good BBQ. i had the FRENCH DIP SANDWICH
roasted tri tip on a french roll 'au jus' and apple horseradish (i asked for it on the side). the bread was nice a warm and every bite of the sandwich had a nice crunch without the au jus (but just as good with the dip!) and and the apple horseradish was a good compliment to the flavorful trip tip. i opted for the soup of the day with my meal which was a moroccan beef with couscous. i also tried their *famous* BAR-B-Q BEEF SANDWICH
roasted tri tip simmered in western style bar-b-q sauce on a french roll which was really good as well. the sandwiches are about $10 a plate for lunch.

this little cabin is quite small so if you come with a big group, be sure to make reservations especially on a weekend when everyone and their moms seems to be here.  apparently, this is a hot spot for bikers as well. when we got here right around 10:45AM on a saturday, there were hardly anyone, by 1:30PM there were about 20+ bikers and 30+ tourists =D

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I first heard of Cold Spring Tavern on a recommendation by a friend. Being that it is kind of isolated and off the beaten path, it took me a few years literally to finally get here. The first time I drove by on a Sunday afternoon only to turn around after seeing it was totally overrun by a biker club or clubs. Nothing against them, it was just overcrowded. Not hard to do at this tiny restaurant, but the beautiful quaint grounds and separate bar extend the capacity of the tiny restaurant significantly.

The second time was between lunch and dinner on a Monday. Only 2 or three other parties were there and they were only serving a limited bar menu. However, it was enough to get a feel of the unique ambiance on this place. It has a gold mining cabin type feel with a dry creek that runs adjacent to the restaurant and along the picnic grounds that extend well behind this restaurant. If you are familiar with The Old Place Restaurant in Agoura, this place is twice that quaint. The best way to describe it is with pics so I will leave you with a few. I will be back to enjoy a special dinner or lunch someday.

The other varieties of chili aren't available either, just the original. The bowl is small and costs $5. We hung out in the bar and the band played good music, but it was too loud for me. There's also not much seating. It's a nice place to visit if you're passing by."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE. Its truly a hidden gem and definitely worth the windy drive! 
I recommend going on the weekends because you maximize your whole experience with the outdoor bbq, live music and overall awesome ambience. I was truly content.
We bought the tri-tip sandwich ticket for $10. Then the guy at the grill gives us a very generously portioned sandwich. DEFINITELY GET THE HORSERADISH. Try the salsa too! Im not a big fan of either but those really elevate the meal. Im obsessed with the horseradish. I kept going back for more of it. 
I also heard onion rings were good so we decided to try that also. For $8 an order, its definitely on the pricier side but SO WORTH IT. It might be the best Ive ever had. The batter was nice and crunchy but not too heavy or oily. The onion ring itself isnt flimsy either so when you bite into it, you get the perfect amount of both. Overall, a LOVELY experience."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Seriously. The best steak sandwich I've ever had! Trick is: wait until a Saturday or Sunday to go and take your time because the grill doesn't open until about 11 or so... then, go directly to the grill! 

Actually, you have to go inside to pay for your sandwich but you get it right from the big guy at the grill. Not just any big guy, either... the wizard of steak sandwhiches big guy!

We did not have all this knowledge, so we ate breakfast inside. It was fine. Interesting chili... nothing to write home about. Kitchy, woody ambiance complete with the occasional coon-skin-hat. 

In fact, we got our sandwich on our way out. It sat in the back of the car all the way to Los Olivos. It sat there through a few rounds of wine tasting. Finally, the room temperature sandwich was retrieved from the car and paired with some sips of wine. Phenomenal! The stuff dreams are made of! 

It's been months, and I still think of that sandwich. We didn't even eat it at its prime! I can assure you, if I am ever within an hour drive of this place on a Saturday or Sunday... I will return!

Keep an eye out for me, big John!"

Ordered: I've been for breakfast and min h! I like breakfast more. I got their French toast and my husband ordered the chili omelet. For lunch I had the veggie quiche with salad and my husband had the venison burger. Irish coffee. 

2/2 everything aesthetics and vibe: this is the most cozy and authentic rustic place you could go to! Everything has history to it! It feels like your stepping back in time. 

1/1 product, my French toast was delicious and the perfect amount! I believe they make their syrup. The quiche had more cheese than egg in it. Irish Coffee was bad too much alcohol in it for our taste. 

1/1 staff, mostly friendly! Our first experience was fantastic! Donna and the staff were welcoming. But the second time we had Bryan as our server. I highly suggest he gets trained in customer service. He made us feel like we were annoying and a burden to him. 

.5/.5 price, on the more expensive side, especially dinner! But it's doable for breakfast. 

.5/.5 exterior matters, the best mountain gem! It feels surreal especially in a misty day.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The Lost Feather:

Many years ago, back when Spencer really was a gardener and nobody was talking about ugly fences on the Cold Spring Bridge, I was having lunch in the restaurant at the Cold Spring Tavern.    We were in the large room in the front corner.   Back then there was a stuffed hawk sitting on a perch in a dark corner to the left of the window.    At some point during our meal the owner walked over to the hawk  with a feather.  It had a thumb tack through the spine and was very weathered.   It wasn't from that hawk, I believe it was from an eagle.   Without fanfare, with nobody really paying any attention she reached behind the Hawk and pinned it to the wall.  

Our curiosity got the better of us and we called the woman over to explain what she was doing and she told us this story:

When the tavern was opened and it truely was a stage coach stop about 100 years earlier an Indian Medicine Man came by to bless the Tavern.   At the end of his brief ceremony he took the very same feather and pinned it to the wall in the corner where the stuffed hawk was standing guard.   He explained that the feather would bring prosperity to the owners and as long as that feather remained in the tavern the place would continue to thrive.    He warned her that the feather would never stay put and that it would ""move""...   She laughed and said that it really does move, it would disappear for months or years at a time, this time she found it pinned in the cabinet under the cash register.    She says that they bring it back and stick it on the wall where it goes.  

My friend and I have never forgotten that story.   I can't go into that room without wondering whatever happend to the feather!   The Hawk that stood guard is long gone and ownership has changed hands a few times....   We  never thought that the woman who told the story to us was making it up, she seemed very sincere.  

Sometimes when I lose touch with a friend, I know that they will be my lost feather, perhaps disappearing for a few years and then popping up in an unexpected place.   

(and the Tri Tip sandwiches really are as good as all the other yelpers say that they are)"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,The kind d of place you will live for a road trip stop. Is very close from the highway and they have lots of people. Seems very popular among local citizens and they serve amazin sandwiches and chilly. Must stop if you are near by.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,it was worth the drive! we arrive at noon and were lucky enough to beat the crowd. we sat inside near the fire place. i ordered the BBQ tri-tip sandwich with a salad. The bf got the chili cheese fries. All the customers seemed like retired locals. Our food came out in less than 10 minutes. My sandwich was smothered in BBQ sauce. Mmmm just how I like it. The chili fries came in a shallow bowl with cheese and onions. Mmmm those were yummy. We washed it down with a nice cold beer.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,A must do!!! Family had a fun day trip while visiting SB & Solvang... on top of it the food was pretty damn good!!! A for sure go back spot!!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This was the first stop in my culinary adventure up north.

Located in the woods off the 154 and Lake Cachuma area, it is very hidden and you will probably think your driver is trying to take advantage of you. But after a half mile from the highway you arrive. 

Because we had 4 other places to eat this day, and we had another tritip location coming up at firestone grill in San Luis Obispo, we wanted to go light. So we got 2 BBQ Beef Sandwiches for 4 people. They were surprisingly nice and split them for us. Each sandwich was $8.95 I believe.

The sauce was a very mild BBQ sauce, neither here nor there, so I think everyone will like it. It's not too sweet or tangy, so it was good. The beef was good. It was longer pieces of tritip that weren't really cut up....not necessarily a bad thing, but good to note. The bun was a kaiser roll, which was very delicious... Probably the best and most surprising part of the sandwich. It also came with fries, which were fresh, hot, and crisp. Not too thin, not too thick (that's what she said).

Anyways, solid BBQ. I would go back here even though it's probably 3rd place behind Phil's BBQ in san diego and Firestones in SLO"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Awesome. This place is very cool and the food is excellent. Tri tip sandwich is a must. Tender, flavorful and reasonably priced. Comes w a side which I had a cup of Chile Verde soup. A great bargain. Can be a bit out of your confront zone but it is well worth the adventure of finding the location."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Wow!!
So authentic it was insane!!
Atmosphere was great
The people were super friendly and the food was incredible!
Will definitely visit again next time I'm in Santa Barbara area!
Only thing missing was some cowboys walking around"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My absolute favorite spot while visiting Santa Barbara! I was expecting a large lodge but love how it is still a little cabin almost untouched to the way it was originally. The creaks in the floor, the spaces between the wood walls, the cozy stone fireplace, all amazing. When you walk in, it's like you stepped back in time and can just smell the years of fire within the wood. Felt like changing into a plaid shirt and curling up into a fur rug. Loved the menu, couldn't decide but ended up trying the chili and bison burger, both great! We went on a rainy day so the place was empty and can't imagine what it would be like in the summer, (not for me if it's too busy) but loved it when it was quiet as if it was our own cabin.  Would love to return here as the menu had so many options id like to try. A must stop while in Santa Barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This has been a must-do for me and my family every time we have traveled to Santa Barbara- for at least the past 35 years. Cold Spring never fails to delight and impress!
The setting is idyllic. The food always satisfying. This visit was just as wonderful as ever, even with Covid limitations. If you don't get the chili, there's something wrong with you, though the menu has never failed to impress us. 
I was thrilled to find out that there's even a beautiful space out back for private parties. Now I just have to plan one!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Was on our bucket list, so we decided to give it a try. Met a nice couple that was fun to talk to before ordering. Started with venison mushrooms. Pretty good but made me glad I did not order venison as a main dish. I heard so much about their tri tip sandwich but later found out the best one is some guy that has a truck on weekends so what I got was very so so. Hubby got wild boar. The couple that we were talking to got the wild boar and made the comment that she ordered medium rare and it was medium well. Waiter offered to redo but she said no. Hubby ordered medium rare in hopes they get it right. This 1/4 inch thick of boar was medium well too. Tough as leather. Sauce was bitter and not good. I ordered ranch for my salad and got some strange brown vinegary something. I would have sent back after we ordered a bottle of wine, we felt like they forgot about us. A large party came in after us and got their food before us. We arrived at 5:40 on a Thursday, so they we not that busy at all. We did not get our main dish till 6:40. I don't think for $130 for two that we will return. Only thing that was a saving grace, went to AJ Spurs the next night and had the best filet Minion and lobster!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Sun filtering through the trees, the smell of bbq meat and microbrew beer permeating the air. The stupid sounds a Harley idling ringing in your ears. 

If you love beer and meat in bread then lunch at the bar of the Cold Spring Tavern is for you. It was heaven.

If you don't like weekend accountant bikers then it is not for you. Note - I don't really. It is such a want to be scene, Harley must love the merchandise rights, you can seriously buy anything with a Harley logo on.  I like 'real' bikers like the ones that I grew up watching in b-movies, you know the dangerous ones, the ones that would steal your woman, and/or whip you in the face with a bike chain. The angels running drugs, being outside of the law, living like no tomorrow. I know one or two, they carry guns in their saddlebags, they still scare me. I digress.

I plan on going back and checking out dinner at the full restaurant as soon as I can. Which I gather, from some good food loving mates, is for you if you love game meat (which I do). 

The place has killer history, you kind of have to go there if you are in Santa Barbara, Solvang or Los Olivos."

I did a full walk around of the property before coming in to order. The property is so lovely. Everything we ordered was delicious! The service was friendly and fast too, but we didn't feel rushed. I had the chilli sampler, the tomato, eggplant, & basil quiche, and one of their bbq sandwhiches. Yum yum yum! We ordered the pecan pie to go and it was such a nice treat later that evening. This is a great hidden gem for SB."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Very rustic restaurant in the middle of a mountain forest. Food was interesting and delicious. We had the rabbit medallions and leg of lamb. Wish we hadn't filled up on the onion rings first!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Well worth it to make a stop here for the sandwich. Be sure to check the time as it is only from 11-3 pm. It is so reasonable my priced and never fails to be amazing.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"We headed here after a hike in the SB Back country.  I have heard about this place for a while now, but why has it taken me nearly 5 years to make it here?  not sure why, but at least I can now say I have been to the iconic Cold Springs Tavern.

We were a little confused on which entrance to go to, but one seemed to be only the bar.  We got a table in about 10 mins.  The Tavern is very dim inside, which I guess is to re-create the Stagecoach trail environment.  The tavern itself is very casual with animal heads everywhere.  

The wait staff is very fast but they did not seem to be assigned tables, so one would take our drink order and someone else would come and ask again what we wanted to drink.  Definitely do not come here for ""fine dining"", come here for a casual ""natural"" like: i-just-hunted-and-killed-live-meal experience. 

We ordered: 
Chicken breast sandwich (typical sandwich, served with fries -- fries are not homemade, dissapointed). 
Buffalo burger -- pretty tasty, not bad for a burger, served with fries. 
Venison sausage burger -- tasty, but it was too smothered in BBQ sauce.  It was hard to taste what the meat actually tasted like.  Slightly disappointed.  I ordered the salad with this but was disappointed b/c it came DRENCHED in dressing - gross. 

Overall, I felt a little rushed b/c the wait staff was running around.  Now that I've been here, I'm not sure that I would come back, it was good, but just not my sort of thing -- too much meat.  

But the grounds are interesting, you can take a little walk and see the old buildings that the Chinese laborers built for the railroads.  Cool little place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Wow, so much history at this place. I really should have soaked in more facts, but honestly, it was so beautiful & filled with so much taxidermy & antiques, I kind of wondered about like a lost child before going inside for a table.

So I didn't get the famous Cat Cora approved Tri-Tip Sandwich, but I had an excellent cup of Wild Game Chili. Rabbit, venison, & buffalo meat with black beans. Topped with cheese & freshly cut Anaheim chillies. It was delicious! We all shared an order of Onion Rings, & the homemade ranch! I'm not crazy about ranch, but that was some of the best I've ever had. Also the onion rings' batter was thick goodness, made with Sierra Nevada. I asked our waitress to choose for me between the Venison Sausage Sandwich & the Buffalo Burger, she pointed towards the later immediately. It was a great, lean burger, with some thick homemade mayonnaise. The side salad is worthy of mention as well because of the lingonberry dressing. Similar to raspberry vinaigrette, but sweeter & not as tart.

It's hard to find these historical, rustic eateries out in national forests. The food was great, I highly recommend the drive!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Oh, no!! If you've been here before but haven't visited in awhile, then I'm sorry to tell you but it seems like they changed vendors that provided the smoked tri-tip meats. Quality has decreased drastically and you can definitely taste it.

If it's your first time, then it'll be a toss-up. I can confidently state that it was so much better before. Their Au Jus was richer and the meats used to soak it up better. Different sauces. *shakes head* Does anyone know the name of the previous vendor that they used to use? I'm more interested in finding their storefront (if available) over returning to the Tavern.

Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend the Tavern anymore. Not after switching to a less flavorful vendor on a food item that brought out most of the crowd in the first place.

By the way, came on a weekend last. And there were very few people there. Usually, it would always be packed with a line to the tri-tip (for the tickets at the bar & sandwiches outside). Hasn't management realized this change?!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Saw this place on Food Network.  Decided that morning to drive up from LA to try it (I have a lot of free time on my hands).  Its as good a tri-tip sandwich as I've had.  The restaurant is open 7 days a week, but the outdoor grill is not, so double check before you make the drive.  The atmosphere and decor makes it feel like your in Disneyland.  Though the food is much, much better and of course, cheaper."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is our favorite spot to go every time we are in town. The food is always made perfect and they have the best tri tip sandwiches!!! We had a beautiful view and most of the staff was friendly and extremely pleasant, but not our server. We were celebrating my dad's 70th birthday and our server was so rude!!! A full glass of wine spilled and we asked for napkin and he said we had to wait until he took our order! There was wine on our table and seat and we had to wait! Also, we asked if we could substitute and he was short and rude; he even made comments over and over that made us uncomfortable. We have never experienced this before and when he did bring napkins to clean the table he just dabbed it and didn't leave extra so we could finish cleaning up. Unpleasant experience fornny dad's birthday, but I don't fault the restaurant. It's a tradition to go there and we will continue to go."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"If you have to ask about Cold Springs, stop reading, get in the car and drive. Do not pass go and do not collect $200. You will not be disappointed.

Nestled in the cold and dark side of the mountain, CST is the perfect weekend lunch get-a-way on a hot summer day. The temp will drop 30. Bring a hoodie. The property consists of several, log cabins with roaring fires to keep you warm.

Dinner is mostly wild game and you pay for it but breakfast and lunch are much less expensive and I think, more fun. Head up on a Sunday the first thing you'll notice is a lack of parking. It's ok folks, that's a good thing. The road is crammed with biker boys and girls all there for live music, good food and a few cold beers.

Come on Sunday's for pretty darn good Tri-tip sandwiches. Order at the bar along with a frosty beverage, hang out listening to great, live music and make you way to the grill when you're ready. It's messy folks but good. Load on some salsa and grab the napkins. Eat and enjoy. Sunday's are your best bet to experience CST and my favorite day to go.

I can't think of anything negative or even suggestions. Don't change a thing.

From the walls that scream history of decades, the food is absolutely amazing. The Elk chops where rustic and flavorful, kinder and juicy, the Duck breast was so fresh, I felt like I had just fed it this morning and butchered it for the afternoon for dinner, don't under estimate this place, the hidden gem of Santa Barbara that only locals talk about, tucked away behind the old highway. The Chill is a must, and go for the mash potatoes, all portions are generous."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Absolutely delicious food in an idyllic historic setting. We chose outdoor seating, shaded by blossoming trees, listening to birdsongs (We went in early May, when everything in the canyon was fresh and growing). The tri tip, ribs, pulled pork, and burgers are exquisite! The onion rings are seriously the best I've ever had, generously battered, golden, with a delicate crunch so perfect it makes you close your eyes in bliss! Dipped in ranch, they're the epitome of indulgence. The desserts were all excellent, the service was great, and we left stuffed and happy. If you're hungry after a hike or a long drive, this place will make all your appetite's dreams come true!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Most romantic experience!

I've been wanting to come forever, so we traveled from LA and came for my birthday 2 nights ago and it was simply magic. It was a Tuesday so there were not many people, which made it extra special and quiet. 

Fresh bread, yum! I also love how all the meals come with a starter like soup or salad- makes it feel very comforting and like you're getting a home cooked meal with love. 

The salad was super fresh and so many dressing options! I got the lingonberry vin- very good! 

Our server was so nice and friendly and timely with everything. 

I ordered the stuffed chicken with garlic mash. AMAZING! And my husband ordered some sort of steak and he absolutely loved it. 

The only thing I would have changed would have been our wine choice but there is no complaints. 

Thank you Cold Spring Tavern for such a warm experience!"

My friend has been to Cold Spring on countless occasions when he flys here, and this place came highly recommended because of the consistency. 

I ordered chili cheese fries, because I am such a sucker for mouthwatering gluttony. My friend chose the tri-tip sandwich. I shared a few of my fries, but when I tried his sandwich, I took more than one bite. The meat was juicy and tender, which is just the way I like it.

This sweet treat of a restaurant is definitely going into my list of Stellar Spots!!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Such a great little spot. Drive up was just so beautiful and scenic. Because of the rain, everything was very green. The place resembled a little like Knotts Berry Farm as another patron stated. The restaurant was tiny but super cool. You can either wait to be seated inside or order tri tip sandwich's from the bar. 

Chili was decent and the tri tip was good. Would like to go back to try the dinner menu."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Wow, I waited thirty four years to be defecated on! I was last here at Cold Springs Tavern on my Honeymoon, 34 years ago. Just as we pulled up in front of the place, a whole herd of ""Bikers"" pulled up and flooded the place, so we had to leave.

Today, I finally had the chance to go inside and have a meal and the ice cold beer I had been craving for years. We were seated and a short while later our order was taken, and from here on is were the problem starts. Thirty minutes (one beer) into our wait the table behind us ordered their meals, and then ten minutes after that, the table besides us orders. A few minutes later a waiter appears with two sandwiches and zips right past us to the table behind us. The people at the table kept trying to tell the waitress that those were not their sandwiches as I attempted to flag the girl down and let her know they were ours, but to no avail. Again the waitress brought food to the table that ordered thirty minutes after us while we had none. Then fifteen minutes after the food delivery to those who were after us we received ours. We ordered two French Dip Sandwiches and we received two sandwiches that looked like road kill. The buns were squashed, the meat was left over then microwaved to heat. Oh, the table that ordered 45 minutes after us, received their food within seconds of ours. We were treated as if we had rolled around in dog shit, then sat down. we watched as the help was pleasantly helping others, but not us. It surely was not worth the thirty four year wait. NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OR THE DRIVE."

I ate the BBQ venison burger and it came with cheese, grilled onions, and french fries. It felt like we were in a small mountain town and it was a wonderful experience.  The ambiance gave us a break from the usual fast pace of many city restaurants."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Very interesting, cool rustic hideaway up the pass. Definitely tucked away with no mobile service. It definitely has character, history and sounds like a hopping time during the weekends when they also have live music.

I got the Tri-Tip sandwich which is the go-to item and it did live up to the hype. It was one of the best tasting tri-tip beef I've ever had. Tender, moist, flavorful and with a little bit of smoke. The sauces were really fantastic, both BBQ and the horseradish cream. Didn't try the salsa which felt like blasphemy to me. Only thing that would have made the sandwich better was a crustier bread vs the soft roll which was a bit too doughy for me. Side of mashed potatoes were very good. Started with the chili which was very well made. Nicely cooked beans, not over cooked, they held together nicely and with some raw onion and cheese. Very good solid chili.

Unfortunately they don't have their onion rings at dinner, so i'll have to try and hit it up sometime for lunch to get their famous rings."

Lots of outdoor seating in which you order through the host and pick up at the counter when ready. I sat inside right away and was served promptly. I could see how on the weekends it's gets super busy and it's rather small inside but it's well worth the wait! I had the wild game black bean chili with a deliciously moist buffalo burger, with Jack cheese, on a fresh squishy roll. The ambiance is so cool and the servers were very friendly.

As others say, the place gets crazy busy on the weekend. No big deal - the bar is open and their drinks are top notch. I had one Ojai Jail Old Fashioned, got a buzz and because my partner was driving, ordered another. :) That drink was - wipes tear from eye - perfect.

Where it all fell flat was the service and the food. After sitting down, our server walked up to us and said, ""Hi, are you ready to order?"" in a very rushed and impatient manner. As we ordered, he was looking around. He didn't write anything down, which is fine if you are going to get the order right, but as you probably guessed, it wasn't. I ordered the ""Bar-B-Q Ranch Salad"" with tri-tip. which is supposed to have some more exciting things on it like cheese, tomatoes, etc. What I got was a version of the house salad. When I asked the server when he *finally* came back around, he said it was the BBQ ranch salad. Ehh...sir, this is not the salad I ordered. The tri-tip was so thick, which made it really hard to cut with a plastic knife in a paper holder. No biggie...whatever. We also ordered the onion rings. When our food was brought out, there were no onion rings in sight. We thought they were coming, so we waited. When he came back (the time when I commented on the salad), we asked if the onion rings were coming. He said, ""oh, you want to order those?"" and we told him we already did. He looked at us and was like, ""oh, right, yeah, I bet they are almost ready"". They came out once we were already finished with our food. *insert grimace face* My partner liked his chili nachos, which was a plus, but everything else was just a disaster. To be honest, it just seemed like our server was way more interested in picking up one of the scores of LA IG girls there and not interested in actually paying attention to us. The bussers had much better customer service and seemed to be doing all the heavy lifting for the checked-out server. I saw the server fulfilling requests from other tables who grabbed him as he walked by. We did the same because our server barely came to our table.

I would come back because it's a cool place, but probably just for a drink or app. I don't think the food was that great, but I bet trying some other things on the menu would be fun...as long as they don't forget to bring them out after you order them. ;)"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is incredible. The atmosphere is amazing. Beautiful forested area in the hills with a creek running past. Even without the restaurant this is a place to see. But the restaurant is amazing as well. Some of the best BBQ I've had in a long time. And don't leave without having the onion rings. They're perfect, definitely the best onion rings I've ever had. I also had the BBQ beef sandwich, the sauce is delicious and the tri tip is great.

The staff is very friendly and helpful and they know a lot about the history of the location and buildings."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place was a hidden gem. Long lines, but great food. They even have someone taking your order for drinks while your waiting. I got the original tri tip sandwich and fries, and island blonde beer. They are dog friendly and have great outdoor seating options. Super cool area too explore too."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I heard about this place while watching the Food Network. We stopped for lunch on the way up to Cachuma Lake. We also stopped on our way home for lunch (it was that good!). 

I love the buildings. they're about 100 years old and they look like it, but not in a gross, health department needs to shut it down kind of way. They're just there to do their thing and they do it so well! 

The first time I ordered the pulled-pork sandwich and potato salad. I loved this sandwich. The sauce is perfect. Not too sweet, not too spicy. The pork was so tender and flavorful and the bread was perfection! The second time I ordered their wild game chili (venison, rabbit and buffalo). It was so meaty and satisfying, I mopped up every bit of it with the tortilla on the side. The spice level is great; they add jalapeno at the last minute. I also ordered the french dip sandwich which was great. The horseradish was just right. It elevated the sandwich without masking the seasoning of the beef. 

I will be returning to Cold Spring Tavern. Their pulled-pork sandwich alone will be reason enough. I will have dreams about this sandwich!

I just had to add, I've been back twice since I wrote the first part of this review and have been very happy each time. I've tried their baby back ribs which were tender and sucuelent with a sweet and tangy sauce. I also tried their buffalo buger and was very happy. The meat patty was moist and favorful and I loved the bun they placed it on. 

My husband and I have set a goal to try everything on their menu at least once. Each time we go to Santa Barbara we have something to look forward to!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Come on a Sunday for the tri-tip. It's served separately from the restaurant but is delicious. They offer multiple sauces for the heap of meat.  

Fun place to hang out but just know it is a biker hangout.  Might be intimidating at first but if you stick around you'll realize how great the food is, the ambiance, and the music.  

Could be difficult to find parking as you just park on the side of the road. Also hard to find if you don't know where you're going since it's really tucked away.

I prefer to go to dinner at the restaurant. The meals are a little pricey but come with a TON of food. You're able to get a choice of chili or salad with your dish and then it comes with veggies and a potato dish (french fries or mashed potatoes I believe).  The inside of the restaurant is very cozy - fireplaces, deer heads, historic photos. It's great when you're driving up at night and the restaurant appears after a few minutes on the pitch black road. It's decorated in lights and just immediately sets the mood that makes you feel like you're farther from Santa Barbara than you really are."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"VEGAN EATERS HERE............Ok, there are a handful of restaurants, anywhere, that have the charm of Cold Springs Tavern, many in Europe, but few are any better for atmosphere, coziness or, sense of place. I promise to return in the next little bit of time to take pictures, the evening we were there, a camera would have just been too intrusive in the intimate spaces, you will see what I mean.

The CST is a series of buildings, going back over a hundred years or so, having been a stagecoach stop between Santa Barbara and the Santa Ynez Valley and beyond. Not going to go too much into the history but, it is long, storied and fascinating, anyone who works there will stop on a dime to share it with real pride. Just ask!

There are several rooms, almost like being in The Shire, small, intimate, brilliantly funky, curated with true affection with no strings showing, small stone fireplaces in virtually every room, old fashioned kerosine lamps on the tables, all of which casts a glow on everything, including you. If you don't take your squeeze, date (with potential for more), a spouse of 5 or 50 years or new one, you're just crazy. Again, you will know what I mean when you walk in the little door, overgrown and infinitely inviting.

Service is almost affectionate, not intrusive or fussy, but very good. The food is different from lunch to dinner, lunch being more roadhousey, dinner a bit more elaborate. The dinners are enormous, including a salad large enough for a family, main courses easily shared, desserts (not vegan unfortunately) all house made as is the bread, seasoned with fresh garlic or molasses and the bar is very complete as is the ""Local Loaded"" wine list. 

This is NOT a vegan/plant based establishment, to be clear. That said, they could not have been more gracious, providing us with a vegetable linguine that had neighboring tables ordering when they saw it. Loaded with vegetables, not the typical thing they throw together to patronize you in most places (gotta have something for 'em, right?), nope, richly flavored and we both brought 1/2 home.

As I mentioned initially, will return to take pictures soon. I lied, I will return soon to eat the food, bask in the glow of the warm fires and awesome vibe, go next door to the bar for live music and then take pictures. Seriously, don't miss a chance to visit, just 20 minutes north of Santa Barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,The hosts are the WORST.  They are terrible at their jobs and have so much attitude.  I don't think they could make it more obvious that they hate their jobs.   Tri tip sandwich is meh at best.  Bomb onion rings tho.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern is a hidden gem in the hills, secluded among the oaks.  They have tritip available on Saturday and Sunday, cooked fresh outside.  The restaurant itself has excellent food and interesting takes on classics that you're probably familiar with.  If you're a fan of a wide variety of different types of meat that you can't normally find elsewhere, you'll find a lot of different items to try here as well, as they often feature a variety of different meats such as elk and bison.

I think that my only complaint about this place is that the service has been incredibly slow the times that I've been here.  Everything seems to take an unnecessary amount of time here.  The last time I came, when I arrived with my SO, our table was dirty.  It took the guy several minutes to return with a cloth to wipe it down after we had asked.  It took a similarly long time to bring us water, take our order, etc.  It didn't even seem that long between ordering and the arrival of the food probably because everything else took a while.

Other than the timing issue, everything was great, and I'm always looking forward to a nice meal here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I do enjoy a Sunday afternoon at Cold-springs for the music and Tri-tip sandwiches, or a nice quite dinner during the week. The people who work here are very friendly and the service is good. Try the lamb or fish.... just about anything is very good! I live close by and this place is a staple for me. They do attract an eclectic crowd and the people watching on Sunday is a favorite past time with some good music to boot!"

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"These two stars are for dinner only - I haven't been for brunch in years, but their brunches have been fantastic in the past and were worth the fun, winding drive.
Dinner is another story. We arrived on time and were seated in the hottest room imaginable for a restaurant - well over 90 degrees, one small oscillating fan pointed at another table. The interior is fun, a very lodge-y atmosphere - taxidermy, stone fireplaces, cozy views of the surrounding woods. None of this is fun when one is sweating buckets.
I ordered baby back ribs - my husband ordered lamb chops, medium rare. Both entrées are in the $30 range and come with a choice of sides and starters - we both got salads and seasonal vegetables. After we ordered, we were served bread - the brown bread was the best thing about the meal, thickly sliced and a little bit sweet. The white bread tasted weirdly of bleach.

The salads were completely lackluster - small portions, dull greens, they had a very store-bought feel - no baby lettuces or heirloom anything here.

My baby backs came - cold. Cold? Really? A $30 entrée? I'm sorry - that's insulting. To top that off, they were dry. A baby back rib can only be dry if it's either overcooked or old. My husband's lamb chops were raw in the center. And the seasonal vegetables were broccoli, cauliflower and carrots (are those seasonal?), almost as raw as the lamb. There is nothing appealing about raw cauliflower.
I've been waiting for the right time to come to Cold Spring Tavern for dinner - I had imagined a little culinary gem. Sadly, it's anything but. 
But do try their brunch."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is an experience that everyone should have. A unique historical Tavern from 1865 and we are all blessed to be able to enjoy a wonderful barbecue here inside this magical location. 
We seat inside and ordered the famous tri tip Sandwich. Because I don't eat much we shared. 
Yes it is crowded but is worth the drive. Also we were seated after only 15 minutes.
Than we walked around and saw all interesting buildings and joy.
Since I became an American citizen one between many others that I feel proud of is how we preserve and maintain the history. That's so important and is our life's treasure. 
Visiting a location like this shows us so much of how was life back then and actually is one of the few places in Us that there is no phone or internet signal but believe me, you don't need. Take this as a gifted opportunity to feel all."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My wife and I read several reviews on Yelp about this place. All were really good. Still not knowing how WE would like it, I was still skeptical. The pictures we saw at first gave us doubts. 
Upon arrival, Rodrigo greeted us. Super friendly and welcoming. He took us to the back where it was quiet and had an awesome view. Made us both feel comfortable 
Grant was our server. Also super friendly and helpful. Now. The food was so amazing. Every bite was so delicious. We had the Tri Tip. The view we had of the forest and some friendly birds was priceless. The owners wife was walking around and checking in on the guests. As she made her way over to us she was also super friendly. Made us feel like invited guests in her home. If I could rate this place any higher. I would.  5x and up. On our way out, Rodrigo said a friendly bye to us. Also used our names. How did he remember that?  One can only do that by taking a personal interest.  
When we are back in the area. We will definitely come back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,A historic hidden gem that takes you on a cool little meal adventure. The tri tip was absolutely good in the capital of the tri tip.

Hubby & I split a pulled pork sandwich which came with a hearty portion of flavorful slaw on the bun & a generous side salad. Super tasty & plenty for two. The meat was so tender & lean.

Friendly service & a dark interesting interior made it a great rest & lunch spot halfway through our motorcycle ride.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a hidden gem of a location hidden in the heart of the Santa Barbara mountains. Both times I went during the weekend and was not disappointed. They have live bands playing and they serve some amazingly delicious but simple smoked tri-tip sandwich. 

The first time we ate at the restaurant and it was an extended wait as there is a sizeable weekend crowd. While waiting you can head to the bar and get a draft or liquor (located in the other building)

The last visit we skipped the restaurant and headed straight to the bar for a draft on tap and ordered the famous tritip sandwich. You get a ticket per sandwich and head over to the area where you smell delicious smoked bbq (really hard to miss but it's outside between the two buildings)

Each ticket will get you several freshly smoked and sliced pieces of tritip in between freshly toasted bread. They have a condiment stand where your choices are bbq sauce, horseradish sauce and a salsa like blend(super spicy but well worth it)

There's usually plenty of seating outside while you enjoy listening to music, eat your sammy and enjoy a draft. 

Btw don't be frightened of the hordes of gruff looking bikers and equally dusty cyclists. It seems everyone is there for a good time of music and great food."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This little charming restaurant in the middle of the forest on the mountain is just what I needed on my day trip to SB from LA. Surrounded by lush greens, this place looks like it's right out of a movie. Great atmosphere - and I love the history that accompanies the restaurant. 

Due to COVID, it is only outdoor seating right now, and the tables/benches are placed far apart. I honestly didn't even mind it, because the outdoor scenery is so gorgeous. 

Everything we got was great - the chili, onion rings, the tri-tip sandwich - I think the onion rings here are really better than any other onion rings I've ever had at a restaurant. Beer and onion rings were just the perfect combination we didn't know we needed for a Monday lunch."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Went for a day trip on the back roads of Santa Barbara county and first time lunch at the tavern a few weeks ago. Just pulling up to this place is a spectacle to behold. Cars and bikes and the band and the crowd out front! 

We had a couple tri tip sammies, onion rings, and the non meat eater in our group ordered a slice of quiche off the restaurant menu.

Everything was really delicious. The live music was great. The vibe was awesome. Would love to go back!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"If you can avoid this place at all costs, please do unless you want bad service and food poisoning.

My family and I came here for a wedding a couple weeks ago and we were excited to see this wonderful place that had a rustic vibe with great food. The area that they use for events was nice, definitely a little country, exactly what the bride wanted. We were given a drink ticket to use at the bar but I wish they would have brought that to the area where we were, because we basically had to wade through people at the outside/bar area and it definitely brought the experience down... because the bar area was disgusting and compared with the reception area, it was in disrepair.

We were served a salad with a ligonberry dressing tableside, which I only took one bite of, and then it was a buffet of their tri-tip, chicken, vegetables and mashed potatoes. The food was just alright, nothing I would rave about (maybe the tri tip in a sandwich is better..?) but the service from the bar was terrible! The bartender was quite rude when we tried to use our drink ticket and told us we owed her 50 cents because I wanted a pineapple and rum and my husband said all he had was a credit card and she told him he had to buy $10 worth of drinks to use it, then took his card to ""keep his tab"". I went back five minutes later with a buck to get his card back, to which she told me he had bought a drink for someone and the total was now $8.50, giving me attitude the whole time. My husband and father-in-law went back to dispute this but she ignored them and kept saying he had bought someone a drink... I think she had charged his card on accident since her ""method"" of holding cards for tabs was throwing them on a small enclave with the bottles of alcohol.

If that wasn't bad enough, two days later, 70% of the family was vomiting and feeling terribly ill and the bride calls to say that many of the other guests have been sick and that there was food poisoning at the venue... They contacted the health department and apparently this isn't the first time this has happened. 

So overall, I would have given this place three stars for ambiance and food taste, but minus those for lack of customer service from the staff and from becoming ill. If you want to hang out with bikers in a dirty bar and receive horrible service and possibly poisonous food, this is your place."

1. Location: amazing
Short drive from Santa Barbara with the most amazing view to get here. Very few times I've truly enjoyed a car ride due to its picturesque view and this was certainly one of them. Located high up in altitude and semi hidden in the trees. 

2. Live music: good
When I arrived here, they had live music, everyone enjoying, dancing, singing together.. it was so lively I loved it. 

3. Food/Drink: 
Oh the briskets.. and the smell.. open fire grilling.. salivating to say the least. 
They are a tavern, so no table service, very chill but rustic yet mysterious.. 
They really only have beer.. so stick to it. 

4. Jail: yes, you read it right. A jail. 
Those who can't handle their drinks right, well, we know where they'll end up. Open since the 19th century.. yes, almost 200 years! 

5. No cell service: I loved it. No one's phone will be ringing and no one will be live streaming anything here.. pure disconnect from everything and be present. At least my AT&T and Verizon both didn't work here. 

6. Car show: I mean, it is not a destined car show, but people who come here have some fancy cars. To me, a walk back to my car was like walking a fancy car show or reminded me of the garage of my own housing complex.. but it looked better here with the better natural lighting and against the trees.."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Quick Summary
The reviews are correct! Cold Spring Tavern deserves its high rating with its rustic feel, tasty food, and service. It's known for its tri-trip but I found the other dishes to be the main highlights

Food- 5 stars
Rib eye steak- this was the lunch special of the day. I was surprised by how tender the steak came out despite having outdoor take-out dining. Very tender, cooked perfectly and large portions

lobster bisque- this was the soup of the day and it was glorious during a cold day. Very creamy and plenty of lobster flavor

Tri-tip sandwich- the tri-tip was delicious, but wasn't as tender as I expected. I can't wait to try the recommended buffalo burger in the future!

Service- 5 stars
They were pretty organized with their takeout orders and the outdoor tables were cleared and cleaned pretty quickly (with the friendliest guy too!). 

Parking
It's all street parking up in the mountains. Would recommend bringing a car that you would normally drive when you go hiking

Bottom Line
Fantastic food and service. Worth the trip if you're in the area!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I don't know how people discover this place, it's close to Santa Barbara but driving here felt like I was driving out of the state. The road to this restaurant is a zig zaggy downhill that will make you wonder at what point you reach the restaurant or fall off a cliff.

The place is quite large with two cabins, one for the bar and one for the restaurant, and a grill smack dab in the middle where they grill their tri tip.

You can order the tri-tip from the bar and get it from the grill or order from the restaurant and receive it at your table or for pick up. Ordering from the restaurant will cost more but will include a side, I recommend the chili, it is large and compliments the tri-tip well.

There is Live music from time to time playing great classics, I did tip the musician for giving us a good experience while eating. I would like to try the other dishes at this place but it will be hard to not order another tri tip the next time I come back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Absolutely fantastic. The bucolic setting alone makes this restaurant a must. My last trip to Santa Barbara was made so much better due to my visit to this rustic, little eatery. The view really is unexpected, especially if you've been hangin out in the downtown area mostly. So, I highly suggest taking the time to go a little out of the way to try the this place out. The food is also great and delicious, home cooked flavors. If you can, also go when they have live music. The band I saw when I was there definitely added to the vibe of this place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I went here with Debra R and Jose R for lunch. I got the buffalo burger. Debra R got the french dip and Jose R got the chicken sandwich.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"O.K. people!  Let's not get carried away.  You can't give four or five stars to a place like this.  Look at the legend that Yelp provides.  Three stars mean a place is ""A-OK,"" and that is all that this place is. Give it four stars and you're saying ""Yay! I'm a fan.""  Five stars and it's ""as good as it gets.""

What I will give you is that this place is a fun biker destination, but that is all.  My girlfriend got her own Harley a couple of months ago, and the ride from Hermosa to Cold Springs was to be her longest ride, and we were looking to challenge her on the mountain roads.  She excelled, the destination did not.  It was just ""A-OK.""

I'm sorry, but you can't give five stars to a place that serves basic meat sandwiches, chili fries, and onion rings.  I'm not saying that it wasn't good, but it was just ""A-OK.""  Get it?

Contrary to what some reviewers may think, this is not a date destination, unless your idea of a good date place is ghetto, like Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  It's just a fun place to turn around on a nice ride, have a beer or two, eat some junk food, and listen to some good live music.  What I enjoyed most about this place was sitting in front of the fire and listening to two fine musicians singing Kentucky blues.  That was romantic--I'll give you that.

I'll also concede that the grounds are very interesting--for a few minutes.  There is plainly a lot of history in that area.

I will be back, but only to wet my whistle, and then a turnaround back to the city, or as a brief stop on my way to a more romantic overnight 4-star plus destination, such as something in the Santa Ynez Valley, and dinner at a true 4-star plus restaurant."

so i know that cold springs tavern can be a bit of a tourist trap but its also well known for locals!
but you gotta know that cold springs tavern is WORTH going up the mountain and enduring crowds, waiting in the cold/rain...so worth it!

Here's what you should know- sundays are tri-tip days. When you get there park on the side of the road, go to the small building with the bar and buy tickets for a tri tip sandwich. Then you go to the tents where they're smoking the tri tip and get your sandwich on!!!
I recommend mixing the BBQ sauce and the apple horseradish sauce- very tasty!
THENNN if you really want to get crazy, go into the restaurant and order a side of their onion rings!! it may take a couple minutes but SO WORTH IT.

I don't have tri tip that often (im a midwest gal afterall..) but this tri tip sandwich was THE MOST TENDER tri tip i've ever had.
i can't wait until next sunday...- i'll be baaccck!

sidenote- if you dont want tri-tip (pshh your loss) you go into the restaurant to put your name in for a table. Keep in mind they stop serving lunch at 3 on weekends."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a gem of a spot! Highly recommended. 

This place is the epitome of ""off the beaten path."" It takes a good amount of time to drive here from any direction, and truly makes the trek feel like an adventure. The drive up is gorgeous and very woodsy, as is the venue itself. 19th century buildings with a cool rock fireplace, ample indoor/outdoor seating, and a bit of parking. Be prepared to park on the narrow, winding road and walk a good amount as this place fills up on weekends. 

Sundays are the days to come. There is always live music, they have the outdoor fire pit going, drinks are a'flowing, and their barbecue is in full swing. I'm a huge fan of the barbecue tri tip sandwich, prepared right before your eyes with all the fixings. It's hearty and delicious, and pairs very well with a cold beer. 

Definitely worth the drive!"

I loved loved lovedddd the setting. It's away from the city and you're just hanging out with folks in a cabin-esque restaurant. Super cozy. 

The menu consisted of sandwiches, salads, soups, quiches- the classic American lunch options. My coworker kept raving about their molasses wheat bread so I asked for a side of the bread. I went with their famous BBQ beef sandwich with a side of tomato basil soup. 

First of all- their molasses wheat bread - WOW. It was served hot and fresh. Probably the best bread I've ever had. 

The BBQ beef sandwich was interesting- it had lots of beef and sauce all over. I thought the sauce was a bit too sweet but that's just me (I have low tolerance for sweetness lol). The beef was tasty. The soup was creamy. The sandwich is a solid BUT the molasses wheat bread is what stole my heart. 


It's a bit far but worth the trip. Fair prices and great service. I'd be happy to just get my hands on that molasses wheat bread on the daily!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I wanted to eat here for a long time. We ordered the tri tip sandwich and it was outstanding. We also had the pulled pork and it was good but not as tasty as the tri-tip. Prior to lunch we ordered cocktails at the bar. We found the staff to be very friendly. Get here early! The place is busy
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"You'll never find it.  Off hwy 154 is a very small sign to the side road.  If you find it, you'll weave and swerve around tight and narrow roads until you come to it.  Definitely, get directions.

This is one of my favorite places, and used to go quite often when I lived in Solvang 10 years ago. Now, it's an annual trip.  Try it again at night when the big ol' fireplace is lit. It's quite special, and romantic.

Among the great dishes I've tried: Cold Spring Chicken (my fave), and NY Peppersteak.  The menu is not expansive, but it's enough -- and will run you $20-$30 per entree.  But the chili, oh the chili, is so good..it's tough to pry myself away from it.

A couple of special features:

1.  Friday and Saturday nights, a separate building hosts a jovial bar with country and bluegrass bands.

2.  Sunday days are quite special.  Bikers (most are doctors and lawyers with expensive Harleys) invade the outdoor space for an old time cookout BBQ of tri tip sandwiches.  Sooooo good.

All in all = fun and relaxing.  It's an experience."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"On My way home from Solvang, I decided to take the back route and take a small hike at lake Cachuma. I worked up quite the hunger. Luckily, cold spring is just a hop and a skip away. I had heard some pretty good stuff about this place and it definitely lived up to the hype.
On A sunny Sunday afternoon, this place was packed! Only ""street"" parking is available, although it's more like side of the road parking. Nothing marked, just find a spot that is off to the side and park.
The actual restaurant/ bar is its lone wood cabin. Small with no frills. There are long picnic tables out front. The building to the left is the bar the one to the right is the restaurant. In between is where the magic is happening on Sunday's. The grilling of tri tip Santa Maria style. The smell of the wood and smoke completely surrounds the place. The guys grilling are pulling the meat straight off the grill, slicing it up fresh and putting in a hoagie for everyone. 
Beers are cheap and the sandwiches ($10) are huge! They offer a few condiments to top the tri tip: a horseradish mustard cream sauce, barbecue, and pico de Gallo. All very delicious. 
There's a variety of people that gather here, the most notable, bikers, and the rest are tourist types. Odd mix but everyone is there to indulge in those awesome sandwiches. 
Come hungry! You will not leave disappointed!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"""Great place to relax and grab a bite and a beer""

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We had our wedding at Cold Spring Tavern almost 2 weeks ago. We've been coming here for tri tip. One day, after a not-so-successful visit to a wedding venue in Santa Ynez Valley, we stopped by for dinner and learned that they host weddings. A month later we came back and met with Brian Hall to reserve our date! Matt Bush, the onsite manager, took over wedding planning and to this day, we can't thank him enough for the hard work, patience, and care he put to our wedding. The food courtesy of Chef Moises was delicious. He is so passionate about cooking and our guests were raving about everything he put out that night. One of our friends wanted to take home a bucket of his mashed potatoes. Everyone who works at Cold Spring Tavern and helped out at our rehearsal and wedding have been there for years (I mean we're talking over a decade!) and you can tell they put a lot of love to their work. At the end the night, wedding party, guests and Cold Spring staff were all hanging out like old friends. Taking shots, doing our first ever keg stands, and having a good ol' time. It truly is a magical place. If you're a humble and kind person who is looking for a unique venue to get married, please visit Cold Spring Tavern, talk to Matt and reserve your date soon. We love this place and admire the staff so much, we'd hate for them to have to work for some bougie, high maintenance, and snobby people."

Amazing restaurant that has been there for 100 years? 
I don't know the complete history but I'll let you figure that out. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was from the old west warm and comfortable.
I almost didn't go and was so very happy that I did. 
The staff was wonderful and this was certainly an experience I will remember.

Thanks very much!

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Updating this review only to further reiterate that we did in fact come 20 minutes after opening. The food that we received was still not good, but our review mainly regarded your staff members being unnecessarily rude. We were waiting in line like everyone else, and the man stationed to cut the meat and put together the sandwiches had yelled out at us to ""wake up"" to pay attention. Understandably, there were other people in line. That does not excuse the fact that it's a quality of customer service. We're not from the area and we were recommended this restaurant. We went out of our way to drive 3 hours to get there. The talk about us being ""upset that you were unable to serve us"" is incorrect. We were in fact served, but we were served impolitely. The most infuriating part of your response is that instead of taking our review as a way to improve the customer service for your establishment, your response contained false pretenses that covered up our bad experience. It's insulting to imply that we didn't know what we paid for and didn't know what we ate."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"All my years residing in the area (9 out of the last 25years), I knew this place existed and have a lot of friends who love it, including my other half. After a day of wine tasting, we ended up here. Food smelled wonderful but we had dinner plans elsewhere. One thing I have to say about this place is that you will find an ecletic mix of all walks of life and everyone is just totally chill and mellow. I can't wait to go back to this place and make an afternoon of it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Let's keep it short... I came here wanting to love the place, as this was going to be my highlight of my trip to Santa Barbara. Went there and it was packed, which is fine with me. After a 5 min walk up the mountain, we get there and I'm amazed at how cool the spot is. I have a few friends from the Santa Maria area, and they always talk about the BBQ out  there, so I was looking forward to the tri tip sandwich. I ask the server guy about the tri tip and if it's Santa Maria style, and this guy became an Ahole and starting talking to me like I'm an idiot. I am a pretty big guy myself, and as I started to get angry, he realized it, and starting changing his tone. It was too late and I left pissed off and will never go back again. What's sad is that every customer I saw go up and order a sandwhich, was treated like crap from this guy... He kept telling everyone that he is closing in 45mins and they better have their ticket before then, or he is gone. I understand getting mad at someone ordering 5 min before you close, but 45min? Only reason this got a 2 star review is because of the location being awesome."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I love this little hidden gem.  Back in the woods near Solvang this place is great. The open pit bbq tritip is very yummy indeed. The jail cells and the other historical buildings on site are fabulous pieces of history.  Great place to hang out in the summer with a cold brew and some music.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"1999 visit was fabulous, 2010 not so good, to the point that it will be a long time before we consider going back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We came by this place yesterday (Sunday) to see what all the ""best tri-tip"" hype was all about...well all the hype is well deserved...they literally have the best tri-tip sandwiches ever. I couldn't believe how tender and delicious the meat tasted and I must add, it was a generous amount of meat. There were buckets full of BBQ, horseradish and salsa available to add to your sandwich. I  loved the BBQ and horseradish sauces - it complemented the sandwich well. 

It was very busy when we got there. Parking is along the road which  was packed when we got there but people were constantly leaving. The line to buy a sandwich was long, but moves rather quickly. Seating isn't too bad, just like parking, people come and go all the time. The entertainment (the blues band) was awesome. Quite a talented band! Glad we made the stop to try out the sandwich and enjoy the band!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Disappointing. The silverware was dirty. The mushroom soup that our server said was awesome was lukewarm, gritty, and completely unseasoned. Not good at all. The elk chops ($29.95) were tough and the 'demy glaze' (!) was far too strong. Vegetables were overcooked and not seasoned at all. The service was horrible. Our server never came back to the table to offer drink refills or to see how our meal was. 
I've eaten here before and had much better food than tonight. The atmosphere is great - all rustic and tucked away in the woods. Sure hope they can improve and get better again."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place is such a gem! We loved the tri-tip sandwiches and onion rings...great for a splurge meal and a lot of fun too. We listened to music and people watched for hours before heading back down the mountain. A must-visit if you are in Santa Barbara and looking for good comfort food and a unique glimpse of the area!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My wife came up to Cold Spring Tavern because they said they have great Tri-Tip sandwiches on weekends. The sandwich didn't disappoint with a side of beer and the cold air kept our beers cold. This is somewhat off the beaten path, but it's no secret. There's plenty of people passing by and getting great food. Wanted to actually eat in the restaurant, but it was over an hour wait, so we opted for the sandwiches outside which was good too. I will definitely come back to Cold Spring Tavern. Just love the atmosphere...a lot of people enjoying good food!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Cold Spring Tavern is about 5 minutes off the freeway. Be weary as it is a narrow windy road to get there and there is no designated parking spaces. All parking is on the side of the road. You check in at the podium and there are seats scattered around the property while you wait for your table. The gentleman at the podium was very nice and hospitable. Cute and quaint restaurant. 

Tri-tip sandwich: average. The sandwich consisted of tri-tip and a roll. The tri-tip itself was above average but needed other things in the sandwich. The bread was plain and boring which made the sandwich average. The plus side was the bbq sauce was very good. 

Chili nachos: average. We upgraded to the wild game chili. The meat was good. Overall, nothing exciting. 

Service: average. Our server didn't come over to check on us after we received our food. When I flagged him down for more bbq sauce (half way through my sandwich) and water he seemed annoyed. Again, nothing special. 

Overall, I would recommend this place if it's on the way to wherever you are going. However, I wouldn't go far out of my way."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a fun place. The historic perspective of this old stage Coach stop was what brought us here, but we were amazed by the quality of the food. 

We had the Tri-tip and the quiche, both were excellent.  

Staff was friendly and efficient. The ambiance is awesome. 

After dining you can wonder around the various old building. 

Do you want to eat at a place that time has forgotten?  This is your place"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is out of this world! From its appearance, to location, food and customer service, this place surpassed my expectations. 
We came here on a Friday for lunch. I had read that reservations were highly recommended so I called to do so but was told to come on down since they had open tables. About an hour later we showed up to this little tavern that look straight out of a movie. The greenery, the fresh air, the clean grounds. I was liking what I saw. We walked in and got seated within minutes. The inside is really small but don't let this fool you into thinking hot and muggy. We were lucky to be seated next to a fan which kept us cool and comfortable. 
When It comes to the menu, we ordered their tavern burger. The food was great! Only wished they could have asked us about the meat. I like well done and these are served medium rare. Customer service is great. All the staff members were very friendly. Everybody saying hello and flashing smiles. 
This place is epic! It's got the looks, great food, awesome customer service, and perfect location! Will be back soon!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I love love love to find places like this! Live Blues, beer, and Bikers galore. Every town I've lived in has had one...now I need to find the one in LA.

Skip the dine-in experience, go straight for the Tri-Tip from the outdoor grill. Three amazing sauces- pico de gallo, bbq, and horseradish mustard. Just slop them all on. Be sure to grab a fistful of napkins. Cop a squat on an old tree stump in front of the band (ok,  today it was 2 guys on stools, one playing an empty wine case) and soak up the ambiance. 

The drive up is amazing. We managed to take the long scenic route up along Painted Cave Rd. Pretty hairy twists and turns, but G's car handled it like a pro. Highly recommended for the panoramic views of Santa Barbara and the coast."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Go back in time for a good meal. The restaurant is unique. Old west decor with oil lamps on the table. The food was good. They make their own BBQ sauce and desserts. My husband enjoyed the Bison burger and I had the ribs..great flavor. The peanut butter cheesecake was very rich, great for sharing. The restaurant is small but the atmosphere is great. Before or after your meal take some time to explore the other buildings and read about the history."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Tried this has it came highly rated. The tri tip sandwich was good, the tri tip was tender and came with choice of sauces, the spicy salsa made it for me combined with the bbq sauce. Service was so so. Had asked for take out order only to be told they weren't taking take out orders and I'd have to wait for a table, I was told 20 mins wait... By the time they offered me a table, I said I just wanted takeout n they could give the table to someone else, they told me I should've said that and they could've taken my order from the beginning! ‍‍‍ Overall anything to write home about, it was good but not worth going all the way just for that sandwich."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Came here for the famous Tom's Backyard Barbeque Tri-Tip Sandwich which they sell outside of the restaurant.  Boy, oh boy was it tasty.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Hung out at Cold Springs Tavern last weekend, as one of the stops on a Bike Rally Fundraiser. Great location. Beautiful with all the trees. Had a drink and hung outside. Good little spot to ""get away from the city""."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Great vibe, mediocre food. Myself and three others came by on a weekend and had a lovely time soaking up the atmosphere, with the sun gently peeking through the tree cover, lots of families and biker groups and tourists hanging out, live music on the other side of the property, it was a picturesque little scene. Very quaint to walk through the historic trading post grounds and drink crisp, refreshing water collected from the spring. The vaunted tri-tip sandwiches were just OK though.
It started to taste like something special when you combine all three of the provided toppings in generous proportion (BBQ sauce, salsa, and the excellent horseradish mustard), but the meat was very unevenly cooked and some portions were unpleasantly raw and straight up needed to be tossed out. I do sympathize for the pit masters though who seemed very tired and stretched thin from the huge crowd, so I don't hold it too much against them.
Overall I would definitely recommend a visit to this place if you're looking for cool Santa Barbara destinations that aren't centralized downtown. Definitely wrap this in with a visit to the Chumash Painted Caves down the road while you're at it. But keep your expectations in check in terms of this being a food-centric destination."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"OMG!  This was the best meal, and dining experience, I've had in a long time!

We've been taking day trips while my Honey is on vacation because it's thrifty and we can drive an hour and enjoy a new restaurant.  We call it Day-cationing.  ;)  Our Day-cation on Wednesday took us up the 154 toward Santa Ynez Valley.  There at the top of San Marcos Pass, overlooking Santa Barbara, is a hidden gem - Ye Cold Springs Tavern.

So easy to miss, be on the look-out for the hill with the cross on the right if you're heading North, and you'll immediately see Stagecoach Road on the left.  Head on down the canyon and go back 100 years.

The buildings were originally a stagecoach stop for the Wells Fargo Stagecoach route.  The restaurant is in a 100 year old building.  With oil burning lanterns and fireplaces in every room, the charm here is top notch.

Honey went gaga over all the meat eater options - Venison, Buffalo...  He opted for the Chili Cheese Open-Face Burger on Tavern Toast.  (This was the only meal he had all day there was so much food!  In fact, I'm not sure he's eaten since.  He definitely got his moneys worth!)  The fries are medium sized and cooked to a crispy perfection.  

I went for the special of the day - Shrimp Linguini with Artichoke Hearts, Mushroom and Fresh Spinach in a Garlic Cream Sauce.  O.M.G.!!!  This was so amazing!  The shrimp was cooked to absolute exquisiteness - I have never had succulent, juicy shrimp before.  I have really been missing out!  There were more toppings than pasta, which was a nice change too.  YUM!!!  I'm going to be craving this meal.

Plus, I got to try something new - Lingonberry Vinaigrette!  Sweet and spicy at the same time, I had to fend Honey off my salad after I gave him a bite and he became enthralled with it too.

Oh!  And they also serve local beers here that you can't get anywhere else too - such as, Island Brewery's Blonde Ale.  Island Brewery is down the coast a bit in Carpinteria.  Honey also went for a Firestone Double Barrel Ale brewed on the other side of Santa Ynez Valley.

The service was great and the servers were relaxed and attentive at the same time.  The whole meal was $42 for 2 entrees and 3 beers - cheaper than some happy hours we've been to!  

The stuffed bear, lanterns, fireplaces, and old time decor really helped make the atmosphere feel like we had just got off the stagecoach out front.  Cold Springs Tavern is definitely worth the trip!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My family comes here every year in the Fall while we are staying at the Alisal Guest Ranch, this place is something special. It is an old stagecoach stop from the early 1900's and doesn't look like it's changed a bit! 

You would think that the food wouldn't be that great here by the looks of it, but you'd be dead wrong! I've been here several times and have had the Chili Sampler, Buffalo Burger and Venison Steak Sandwich, all of which are delicious in their own way! They have a full bar with a good wine and beer selection, but we usually bring our own wines. 

The ONION RINGS are to-die-for good! Just get them! Sierra Nevada breaded and delicious!

The atmosphere of this place is what really makes it special, the floor is warped and the walls are adorned with old west artifacts. This place is fun and tasty for all ages!

MY GO-TO-DISHES: Venison Steak Sandwich, Chili Sampler and Onion Rings!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"""Feasting in a forest"" - printed on the bottom of your receipt.  On our drive up to Solvang, we stopped by Cold Spring for lunch.  After that winding, curving drive up the mountain, it's nice to be able to stop and stretch your legs.  This quaint little restaurant is situated next to the massive (haha) Ojai jail.  In all seriousness though, take a tour of the area behind the kitchen after you eat.  Nice little distraction. 

Here's what we had:
Chili burger $9.75 - they're famous for their chili, of course I had to order!  Burger was a bit on the dry side, but the chili was great!  Order a side salad with the lingonberry vinaigrette to feel less guilty.
Firestone beer ~$5 
BBQ beef $9.75
Grilled Veggie salad $9.75
Veggie quiche $9.75

Service was very friendly and it wasn't too crowded at lunch time.  There were some larger dining rooms towards the back of the restaurant, so I'm sure they can accommodate large parties."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,One of my all time favorite places in Santa Barbara! A hidden gem!! Always love to finish my day here after exploring the mountains. On sundays they offer the best tri tip sandwich ever that's well worth the wait! Even on the hottest days it's always nice and cool in that canyon which makes for a nice retreat from the heat. There is live music most nights of the week and they have good prices on beer.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"How have I not reviewed this place?!?! I have been to CST multiple times, and it is hands down my favorite lunch spot in SB County. It's beautifully nestled in the Santa Ynez Mountains, and they serve the most affordable bbq lunch I've seen. I love to go bold with the game meats (venison steak sandwich is heaven on a bun), but they are also known for their tri tip. 

Hidden secret- their breakfast is the best. You must get biscuits and gravy and the burrito filled with rabbit, venison and more! Love you Cold Springs!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"If you would like to go to this place for the history and the quaint feel, I highly recommend it. We called ahead for reservations for dinner on a Saturday evening. Always, always call for reservations. The cabin is wonderful and you feel like you really are stepping back in time.
 The menu for dinner is decent, and you get a salad and one side with most meals. The food we ordered was very tasty. We had the appetizer platter, the New York Strip, and BBQ Ribs. The steak was very juicy and larger than most strips. The ribs fell off the bones, which is what you would hope for. We paid $180 with tip for four people, 1 appetizer, 4 meals and one bottle of wine. 
You do not have to dress up, but you can if you would like to. There was a large party that came in after us that I assumed was for a birthday or some other special occasion. That's when our service went from good to horrible. We got our food and drinks in a timely manner, but after that, we weren't served again for over 45 minutes. We were never asked if we wanted dessert, or even had our drinks refilled. My husband had to track down the waitress just to get our check. I understand when they are busy, but when it's pretty much reservation only, you should have enough available staff to accommodate your customers. I would recommend this place to anyone, mainly because of the history, and as I said, the food was good. But if they are busy, don't expect prompt service."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My boyfriend's fam who live in the SB mountains brought us here for an early breakfast.  We were the first ones in the 2nd dining room so we got to snag the table next to the fireplace and had awesome attentive service from our super friendly and accommodating waitress. 

The prices are standard and the food is delicious. I enjoyed the Santa Barbara omelette and the house potatoes were good too. I thought the molasses toast/biscuit w gravy were just okay, toast came on regular sliced bread with a little sweetness, not the fat french slabs I had envisioned...oh well, no biggie b/c it was still a huge meal without the bread. 

I recommend taking advantage of their early opening time and getting quality service for an early breakfast :)"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Here's a tip: If you are driving from Santa Barbara to go to ""wine country,"" take the 154, it's faster and very scenic.

Here's another tip:  When you are starting to descend a bit down the 154, you will see Stagecoach Road.  Turn left.  Don't get scared by all the cars driving up the hill.  Now, follow it.  This is what you will find:

Cold Spring Tavern began as a stagecoach stop in the late 1800s.  It is now a restaurant and tavern, and will surely impress any visitors to the Santa Barbara area.  It is tucked away on a dirt road in the ""other Santa Barbara"" - not the pristine beaches and the celebrity set, but the rustic, great hiking areas and an introduction to the differing North County mindset.  It is comprised of three cabin-like buildings - the tavern which has a full bar, the restaurant, and a strange tiny curio shop.  A river runs by them and it is cooled by shade of all the trees surrounding the property.  

If you would like to eat, they serve all 3 meals on the weekends.  Dinners are $18-$30, but good.  My mom still talks about the chili sampler she had 5 years ago.  

But, here's the best part.  Go there on Sundays in the afternoon.  A ton of bikers (motor, not peddle) come here to grab a tri-tip sandwich, some beer, and to listen to the live music.  Just buy your sandwich ticket at the bar, turn it in, and try the cut of meat that is the pride of the Central Coast.  

When you are all done, head back out onto the 154 and think about what a lovely place you ""discovered"" and take your friends and family there in the future.  You and they will love it every time."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Historic restaurant from the 1800's located off the old Wells Fargo stagecoach route which is now a main road passing through Los Padres National Forest.
With the recent fires I was afraid this place would be gone but it survived!
Nestled deep within the canyon between two mountains, you can count on it being a good 10-20 degrees cooler than the valley/Los Olivos when heated up. 
I dig this place. The history is palpable. There's a few old shacks remaining and you just get the sense this place has seen a lot. There's a small jail in the back which is frightening but so fascinating. Reminiscent of another time, without a doubt. 
This place just lets the imagination run wild- it was the last stop on the route before travelers hit Santa Barbara. A watering hole of sorts. 
Stop in on Sunday's I think 12-4 for tritip sandwiches & live music. It's a good time & worth stopping in at least once if you're into history. It's very old and just very cool."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Food was good especially the chili you have to try it! I personally liked the tri tip sandwich with their apple horseradish sauce.

It can be a little hard to find and if you are coming from Santa Barbara, you really have to watch your speed as you come to the turn across highway traffic.  A short drive down a windy country road and the Tavern sits in the trees.   There isn't much parking by the Tavern, but you can usually find parking along the side of the road.  The first building is a bar and you can buy tickets for the best Tri Tip sandwich on the West Coast.  There is a full service restaurant next door, but frankly there is nothing better than grabbing a drink and a sandwich and sitting outside on the picnic tables to eat.  There is usually live music outside if weather permits.  Great place to enjoy the drive, have great food and see part of California's history."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My wife and I turned off the highway to check this out on a whim, and it was absolutely fantastic! The tavern is very comfortable, and the complex of buildings is very neat. Outstanding onion rings on the lunch menu, probably the best I've ever had."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Once again my gf introduced me to another hidden gem in SB.

After a nice winding drive up the mountain that had a spectacular view of SB below, we turned off the road and headed down the old stagecoach road to get here. I can ramble on about what you see upon arriving, but just look at the pix peeps have posted.

Anyways, we were starving and so we went inside the tavern part and purchased our food tickets. For you noobs, it's hot dogs on Saturdays and tri-tip on Sundays. We walked to the grill area next to the restaurant and waited a short while and then we were rewarded. HUGE amount of freshly grilled tri-tip served on a toasted french roll that had garlic butter spread! Wow! This was the shiznat! The sandwich was delicious and I spooged in my pants numerous times while enjoying my food.

Needless to say I will venture back here again in the future with my gf to enjoy the yumminess of Cold Spring Tavern, but in the restaurant the next time."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Highly recommended for those who appreciate dining in historic environments. The environment and service staff deserve five stars, the food four, and cocktails only three - the chef likes to drown meats in sweet sauces, and the drinks were out of balance. On the plus side, they do know how to turn out meats a perfect medium rare when that is requested, and the venison sausage stuffed mushrooms were very good as an appetizer. Portion size is good, prices very fair. Drink wine or beer and ask for sauces on the side and you can have a five star experience here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,The drive to this location is very peaceful up the mountain and down the dirt trail to the tavern. The Western themed location is cute and clean. We visited late in the morning and the menu included lunch items (breakfast is available for limited hours and the prices were a little high). My husband tried his first buffalo burger and loved it; my meal was tasty as well. This is a cozy restaurant to visit while in Santa Barbara and the BBQ smells amazing as the staff were prepping for the BBQ dinner menu.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We were told to have a tri tip sandwich and onion rings, and that is exactly what we did.  The tri tip was tender with a hint of garlic and smoke flavors.  Absolutely perfect."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Not sure why this place has 5 stars. Probably because it's a biker stop and everyone is friends, Idk. But bikers and everyone else listen up. Your dude, & his kids bbqing the meat is dirty. Come one guys, even you know better. His kids have colds with runny noses and wiping their noses with bare hands while cutting your meat. They handle raw meat and cooked with bare hands while answering phones, placing hands in pockets. (That was daddy cook). And all that's right infront of us, imagine what's done in private? If that's the secret recipe that keeps bringing you all back for more, thanks but no thanks. The other workers  are very cool. Onion rings were awesome, beer was well priced, but since the trip tip sandwich is main attraction I have to rate you on it. Sorry guys 0 stars for that. You friends and management that work there, you know you all see it and ignore his bad cleanliness habits. It's an accident waiting to happen. Tell a brother to put some damn gloves on and hold the snot please. 
Anyone going to visit, music is great but stick to beer and whatever is closed topped to avoid and extra secret ingredients"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We had seen the Hewell Howser show featuring the Cold Spring Tavern years ago, so on our way to Solvang this weekend we decided to stop by for lunch.

The place is rustic-cuteness with a mountain-cabin feel, and every employee was friendly and helpful. It's a little dark inside, but that lends to the historic tavern feel of the place.

Mainly, though, the food was awesome. We split the French dip sandwich and it was one of the best we've ever had, bulging with thick pieces of delicious beef on a perfectly soft-chewy bun with au jus on the side.  The seasoned fries were the appropriate accompaniment. Yummy stuff!

My only negative was the restroom, which is outside in a separate building.  It fits the rustic feel, all right, but I don't appreciate rustic so much when it comes to the restroom.  However, it didn't prevent me from giving 5 stars and recommending this place to friends."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We just had our team / office Christmas party up at Cold Springs Tavern last night and the service was delightful.  As a large group we were seated in a private room with a fireplace, offered plenty of options with our set menu and had a great time doing ornament exchanges and sharing appetizers.  The tavern is so lovely and charming, we were excited to get out of town (but not too far) and have a totally unique dinner experience.  The ribs and fish were excellent!  Thank you so much for making the evening special for us!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Came here for brunch and had the shittiest experience ever. We decided to sit outside since the weather was nice and told us we could order Togo since they don't serve outside. That was fine so we placed our order. 

We waited around an hour to find out that they didn't even bring our order to the kitchen. The waitress apologized and gave us 50% off our order for the inconvenience which was nice of them.

The food came out 30-40 min later. To our surprise, they messed up our order again. My venison sausage patty was missing the 2 eggs and potatoes. Looks like a coyote took a dump in my order... My brother's order was also missing some items too. We were too hungry and annoyed to give a shit at this point. 

P.S. they kick you out at 11 if you bring a dog. Even if it is a service dog and you're sitting outside. Weird because the owner or whatever allowed his friends to have their dogs outside the restaurant. 

Definitely would not come back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Im in love with this place, been there on Christmas weekend. It was the dreamiest place ever, the weather, the nature, the place, decoration , food , service and everything else is amazing."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My boyfriend and i have been here twice in the last 3 weeks for the Sunday music and tri-tip sandwiches and we cannot stop talking about how much we love Cold Springs! We have not eaten at the restaurant but as far as the bar and music goes, it keeps bringing us back! One of my favorite things about this place is the drive, if you turn on Paradise road off the 154 it takes you under the freeway bridge and it's beautiful, the whole ambiance of this place kills and has a Johnny Cash feel to it. I can't recommend this place enough for good beer and dancing."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern hosted our daughter and son-in-law's wedding ceremony and reception. It was a beautiful rustic venue, and I can't say enough about Jennifer Bledsoe, who made sure that this special day went off without a hitch. The food was incredible (I heard many compliments on the tri tip and salmon!), table setting and chair setup before and after the ceremony was quick, and even the weather was perfect! 

This is a beautiful place to get married and enjoy family and friends. We had a DJ who was able to provide a microphone during the toast and ceremony, and the sound was right on! Dinner and dancing with special family and friends, a night we will never forget! Thank you so much, Cold Spring Tavern."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Always fun to go  hang out on a weekend afternoon.  Great music and tri tip sandwiches.  Nice to just sit outside with  your drink and listen to the music.  Great bloody mary and fun people watching.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I first went to Cold Springs back around 1999 and had been wanting to go back ever since.  It is for sure a unique experience and worth the out of the way drive up the San Marcos pass.  You can read all about the historic significance on their website, but a few things you should know.  The food runs about $25-30 per entree and our wine was $8-10 per glass.  They serve a lot of game, on the menu was antelope, venison, rabbit, and duck.  They also serve the usual chicken, beef, pork and lamb.  The drive up is beautiful, as is the scenery.  I was less than thrilled with the service and the food this time though.  I ordered the rabbit and I didn't even eat half the meat.  The free was good but one of the pieces was still doughy.   The service was just meh and for almost $30 a plate I would expect a smile on your face and for you to check on my water.  All and all this isn't someplace I will be yearning to go back to anytime soon but it is good experience if you have never been."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I've heard about this place for years. Even saw it featured by Chef Cat Cora from the Food Channel. I swore to put it on my must try list next time I was in the area. And yes, it is as advertised, all that and a bag of chips.

First, the menu looks amazing! We came on a Sunday, tried their famed tri-tip.sandwich. Very good BBQ trip-tip served on a soft, but sturdy white roll. They offer roasted jalapeños, and serrano chile's, along with grilled onions, sweet horseradish mayo, BBQ sauce and salsa, as accoutrements. I assure you, one of the best tri-tip sammies you will have. The beer battered onions rings are excellent as well. The mrs and I washed it all down with a passion fruit margarita, and a blondie beer on tap. It was crowded, but the food came out quick. Great grub, on point service!

If you've checked out the photo section, you get the jist of the vibe... Western stage coach, old oakey, divey, biker bar cool. And yes, lots of real deal bikers, hanging out with locals and tourists.

They are open early for breakfast on the weekends, and have live music too! This is a must stop, and good reason to take HWY 154 for a change of pace over HWY 101 between Los Olivos and Santa Barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is a really cool spot on in the Santa Ynez mountains. There is nice outside seating and a full bar with decent prices and live music. Every time I've been it's been folk/ Americana style music.

It's a great place to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon outside after wine tasting or after hiking in the area.

There's a nice restaurant, which looks yummy, but is fairly expensive so we've never eaten there. On the weekends, go for the tri tip sandwich barbecue!!! They are 10 dollars each. It's amazing! Don't miss out on the horseradish mustard!! Many people in my group went back for a second sandwich. A BBQ expert friend of mine said it's the second best barbecue in the area. 

Technically dogs aren't allowed during BBQ weekends, but it isn't well enforced. There's really shady parking though. I highly recommend checking it out."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place is a real gem... Total trip and journey into the past. I had never heard of it and a little skeptical of the food considering the environment is so old...but the food was unbelievable. I would eat here every week if it was closer!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My daughter who lives in Van Nuys took my wife and I for Sunday lunch. 

We each had a tri-tip sandwich. Bread was very good which always makes any sandwich better when the bread is good. The steak was melt in your mouth delicious. They had au jus or horseradish/ranch sauces for the sandwich I had the horseradish/ranch and also added a grilled jalapeno on mine. Heavenly!!! My daughter and wife had the au jus and they both loved it. 

We ordered the onion rings too, 1 portion was enough for the 3 of us. They were fresh cut and lightly battered, scrumptious.

Beer was blond lager on tap. Very good.

Entertainment was a trio Ball and Sultan with a drummer who played a cardboard box with brushes. They were excellent and very entertaining.

Highly recommend if you're in the area.  Beautiful rustic location.

Tri Tip sandwich $13.50 each
Order onion rings $9
Beer 12 oz $5+
Beer 24 oz $9+

I'll be back."

Haha ok no really: awesome vibe, love the decor, LINE DANCING with LIVE MUSIC, WUTTTTT?? I had to sit that one out; didn't have my dancing shoes.

The food was great though. A smidge pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for *thumbs up* And of course, tri tip sammich with their special horseradish sauce was uh-MAZING. Must have. I saw a lot of other stuff on the menu, like rabbit (great that Easter is coming up), buffalo burgers, and venison. I'm not that adventurous when it comes to food, so I stuck with what I knew I liked.

Worth checking out at least once, like if you're driving down the coast and want to find some random quirky place to stop by on the way to SB or LA."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This is a hangout for bikers and such, but still a nice experience outside the city.  I felt like we drove into the wilderness to eat barbecue.  The restaurant is hard to get to but easy to find since it's the only establishment.  There is parking in the dirt area as well as down the street.  The bar is on the left and the restaurant is on the right. Regulars here buy food tickets at the bar just for the tri tip sandwich, which is grilled in the back between the bar and restaurant. Beer, chips, BBQ sandwich...sounds like a good lunch! 

The restaurant has a historic and cozy feel. The door creaks, space is limited and tight, and gas lamps light up the inside.  I was put on the waitlist even though I got there by 11am on a Sunday.  I had to wait outside because there's no room inside at all.  Breakfast ends at 11, but I wanted to try the tri tip sandwich anyway.  It was good but could have used more BBQ sauce.  There were three slices of meat, and the outside crust of the meat was flavorful.  The French roll was toasted and buttered, which was good and crispy.  I enjoyed the sandwich, but next time I'll just get it at the grill.  It's not worth waiting outside in the cold to be seated.  Also the service is slow.  There's plenty of outdoor seating, by the way."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"One of my favorite places. The atmosphere is fantastic, the people is draws are inclusive and fun, and their sandwiches are to die for. The vibe is the best when it's not covid and there is a live band playing music, but even without that, the food speaks for itself. I make sure to stop here every time I am in Santa Barbara!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Nothing, except maybe the chili and the onion rings earns five stars, but everything taken together, including the ambiance the place gets my five stars. As we've aged we do not go as often, but when we do head north on 101, even as much as we prefer the drive up the coast, we will still divert to 154 so we can stop and have a meal here. The food is plain good and the place comfortable, even if we just split a burger and onion rings because we are not as hungry as we might be. Admittedly, we tend to avoid weekends because of the crowds and the parking (have not been near it on a weekend since Covid-19 so cannot say if crowded or not). For those of you who have been to the Saddle Peak Lodge in Calabasas/Malibu, the Cold Spring Tavern is similar, but without the posh, elegance, menu, prices, or parking attendants. If the last sentence makes no sense, you probably have not been to both places."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Wow, I was not expecting the food to be so good! We came here for the tourist aspect, but really loved the lunch - French dip, brisket sandwich, onion rings, incredible potato salad ... Mmmmmmm! We came right as they opened for lunch so didn't have to wait to sit. Speedy, attentive service."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We came to this famous ""old stagecoach stop turned eatery"" on a cold winter day but the vibe here was super warm!   But if the vibe along isn't enough to warm your heart, the ginormous Tri-tip sandwich will certainly warm your stomach! 

The meat was done to perfection and the bun was soft... and they give you so much that the two halves of the bun hardly close!  

If you buy the $13 sandwich, you'd have to eat out in open tables. There's a restaurant but hard to get into. 

The ambiance is rustic, casual and relaxing. Parking can be difficult as this famous joint is super popular!  
CHECK THEIR HOURS before you come (they are not open every day like other restaurants) so you don't end up driving the distance and get disappointed. Lastly, my guess is this place is more enjoyable in the summertime as the shady tree-lines areas can be cold in the winter."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Such a quaint stop on the way to Santa Ynez! As you go off the beaten path and wind your way through a tree lined country road to arrive at this historic destination, you will be glad you did. You park near the creek bed and as you walk to the rustic restaurant you are taken back in time to warm country surroundings and a relaxed vibe. The chili, barbecue and burgers are our top selections on the menu. Whether you sit outside or inside, the experience is great. We like coming for the holidays and sitting near the Christmas tree while soaking in the ambiance. This is a place to just hang and relax! Great photo ops too!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Awesome little hole in the wall place I drove by (or over) for years.  Situated below the cold springs arch bridge, this place is easy to miss.  Thanks to Huell Howser, I realized this place existed and headed on in for breakfast.

The food was good, not great and average.  Perhaps lunch or dinner would be better.  The atmosphere and history of the place make this a great place to drop in for a bite.  

Definitely stop if you are driving through the Cachuma Pass."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Super interesting place. I think in large part you are paying for the interesting ambiance. Our dinner was pretty good though and definitely a unique experience. Service was good and I was able to find veggie options. A little pricey but I've never had anything like it. I enjoyed the grilled portobello ratatouille.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"My family and I were visiting from the Santa Barbara area and in the past we have enjoyed our tines here. We arrived here on Sunday evening as a party of 8 and there was no wait. I attribute that mainly to the tri-tip sandwiches being served outside and the live music next door. Nevertheless we went into the main dining area to eat. We were greeted rather poorly from our server who didn't mention his name but from my receipt I see the name as (Server J N)
We had 4 kids and 4 adults but he served all our water in the wine glasses that were already on the table. Slightly weird since my children have no previous experience of drinking water from wine glasses but...okay. When we ordered he was less than enthusiastic and rather sour. Attitude aside, the food itself was horrible. I ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The steak should have been medium but was very well done and lacked flavor. The broccoli was fresh and still raw. The best part about the meal was the tortilla soup which I would highly recommend. 
On a positive note once we left we enjoyed the live music and the positive attitude outside. I will return here but not to eat in the restaurant"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A favorite little hideaway for a cold beverage, live music and some good food. What was once an old stagecoach stop from the 1800s, still is to some degree as multiple ""wagons"" including  motorcycles and RVs. It's a hip little place near the bottom of a creek wash covered in oak trees. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy some good drinks with friendly strangers from somewhere else. It's a place stuck in time. I've had some great times here. It's fun to come here and have lunch with cocktails then head out to the river swimming holes nearby."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This locations has been here since 1865, an old stage stop on the way in to the city. This place has been a go to whenever in the Santa Barbara area. It is off the beaten path and rustic as it gets, but that's pretty much what makes this place what it is. The bloody marys are solid the tri tip sandwiches hit the spot every time. Almost always a couple rounds of live music on the weekends and the fire place in the bar is pretty massive and a great place to break a chill while having a few drinks. It can get crowded and the waits can at times be a bit long, but soak in the fresh air and the beauty of the surroundings and realize it's all well worth any wait."

A busy Labor Day Monday with lots of families, bikers, and Instagramers alike .. but we were able to get seated inside in about 15 mins (spent the time waiting at the tavern enjoying a drink) and then noshed on some yummy food. I enjoyed the game chili and my husband loved his burger and salad. All of the employees we encountered were incredibly friendly.  Don't expect AC inside the restaurant though, they didn't have that in 1868. A little miserable, but also part of the charm."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Many years ago we made a special trip to Santa Barbara just to have Thanksgiving dinner at Cold Springs Tavern. It was such a pleasant experience we decided to try it again. 

It was just as magical a second time and well worth a day of driving each way.

We arrived far to early for our 8pm reservation quite prepared to wait but the hostess was able to seat us within a minute or two. The evening was chilly so we were very glad for the seat next to the fireplace. That said the whole place was toasty warm and comfy. 

In spite of getting a very large party at about the same time, our waiter was very attentative,  

The traditional turkey dinner was excellent. The warm bread was exceedingly good. The corn chowder was very tasty and refreshingly light. The turkeyhad plenty of light AND DARK (my fav) meat. The weakest element was the dressing. The mashed potatoes were done just right. The bread pudding dessert was great but I was so stuffed I could only nibble it.

Ambiance 5 stars.
Food 5 stars.
Service 5 stars.

A perfect Thanksgiving again.  :-)"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"We made a reservation for what we thought was the Tavern for Thanksgiving dinner. Instead, we were seated in the bar among loud people in the bar getting drinks, without any apology or recognition that we were trying to enjoy our thanksgiving!!! What a disappointing experience. CST should have told us that we didn't get a reservation in the actual tavern WHEN WE BOOKED IT. I was mortified the entire meal because I'm the one who suggested CST and didn't enjoy what normally is one of my favorite days of the year due to my embarrassment in front of my close friends who were gracious but I could tell also disappointed. A total BUST!! And it was expensive on top of it. Bad form CST!! I've been a patron for decades.... the bread pudding was totally dry to the point I didn't even eat dessert. The stuffing was soggy and flavorless. I may not be back....ever. This has left me with a bad feeling about the place, which makes me sad on top of sad, as it was always a beloved local spot for me.

It felt like the equivalent of being in the overflow camping area, and we weren't told about it until it was too late to get a reservation elsewhere. I've  never felt so disappointed on Thanksgiving it actually ruined my whole day...."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Just when I thought I couldn't find a spot that was over a hundred years old, in the middle of nowhere, that had juicy tri-tip, and cold beer, I stumbled into this place. Not really. We've wanted to come here forever. Fellow Yelpers had been posting the place, the food, their experiences, and we finally got to go! It did not disappoint. Great detour off the beaten 154 will get you all filled up to drink way too much wine.

If you're not sure where it is just follow the windy canyon down to where all that smoke is coming from. Yep. That's it. The century old building that used to serve as a stop on an old stagecoach line. There is a restaurant, bar/music shack, craft shop, and a head on the complex. We grabbed a few beers from the shack to hydrate before ordering. 

We walked into the restaurant and were greeted by the bar. Ordered there and stepped outside to find a table. Apparently, you can order sandwiches at the shack and get a ticket you can take to the guys on the grill. I was unaware, so we waited for our names to be called as the keep stuck his head out the front door of the restaurant. Tri tip sandwich with slaw and an order of onion rings. Both great choices as they were devoured quickly until we were down to the last ring, and then it's a standoff. Crispy and crunchy without being too greasy. I forget who won. The tri tip was juicy and moist. They have a horseradish ranch and bbq sauce next to the grill. If the horseradish ranch was bottled and sold, I would have grabbed a dozen. So good. Slaw was also tangy and tasty.

Parking looks like it can be a problem, escpecially on the weekends. A short walk may be necessary, unless you luck out like we did. Great place to finally visit. It won't be our last!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern is the perfect off-the-beaten-path lunch spot. 

You have to go outside of Santa Barbara, up into ""the hills"" a bit to reach it. There is nothing else out there, no traffic, noise or distractions.

Once you arrive, you will most likely have to park on the street, which is easy enough. If you're there for the tri-tip sandwiches, which we were, you enter the building on the left first. That is where you pay the bartender (and order a drink if you'd like) and she gives you tickets for your sandwiches. Then you take your tix to the grill area, get your sandwich, and dress it up. Then you sit outside & enjoy the deliciousness!

For a full restaurant experience, you can go in the other building. They have a big fireplace, antique furniture, and what looks like a great menu. 

The food was, of course, good. But the real draw of Cold Spring Tavern is the isolated location (yet only a few minutes outside the city), beautiful surroundings, and peace."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Gotta go five stars because of the experience all together. The ambiance: low ceilings, dim lighting, big stone fireplaces in each room. The scenery: windy mountain road, beautiful big trees, the cold spring, squirrels, birds... beautiful! The history: an actual stage coach stop! And a darn good tri tip sandwich! 
Saw 'Best thing I ever ate' the other day and Cat Cora said the tri tip sandwich at Cold Spring Tavern was it! Hadn't been here for years, but now I had a good reason to go! Thick sliced tri tip that they grill right outside, good bread, housemade BBQ sauce, housemade salsa, really good fries... it works!
I didn't pay a lot of attention to the menu, but they have chili, burgers, venison, buffalo and wild game among the offerings. Full bar with a wine list, live music, picnic tables outside. It's an overall experience that I love! Great to bring visitors here!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"As a guy who grew up in Texas, hands down this is the best Tri-tip sandwich I've ever had! I love how they emphasize on seasoning it as the priority over just drowning it in BBQ sauce like every other bbq joint. Also, their chili sampler is  too and best chili I've had outside of Texas. 


Staff here is really friends, great service, and love the outdoor country vibes of this establishment. Not to mention they give you great pours on craft beer too. I'm definitely coming back here!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Get there early! Loved the wooded shaded outdoors theme, the old school Ojai Jail and old Cabins is worth just seeing.

March 2021 was perfect weather for an outdoor meal and a beer. Such a cool spot. You're only 20 minutes away from downtown Santa Barbara, but feels like you're in the middle of the woods; it's a whole vibe. Loved it. 

The tri tip sandwich was amazing. Enough to share. Get it. 

Definitely coming back here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Giant tr tip sandwich cookout.  Three awesome sauces - horseradish, spicy salsa, and BBQ.  The hoagie was toasted and fresh.  The trip tip was Cooke at about medium Santa Barbara cookout style.  Juicy, good, delicious. Perfect after day wine tasting.  We got there around lunch time before the crowds really started to pour in.  There are other options, but you can't go wrong with the tri tip sandwich.

-Hidden gem on a nice drive
-perfect for combo wine tasting

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I have been here so many times before with my family and my service dog. Their tri-tip sandwich is the reason I keep coming back, they are so good---but today was the first time I was greeted with aggression. I was stop at the entrance of the seating area by a man that worked their telling ""No dogs allowed"", I told the man that my dog was a service animal (I guess he didn't notice the required California state law service vest my dog had on). He said well if you don't have ID for your dog then you can't come in. I explained by law you can not require to see paperwork for your service dog but my husband walk back to the car to get his ID. While my husband went to the car to get the ID the man went to his car to get some state papers he had stating that service dogs requires ID to enter the restaurant. When he returned with the paper it was a print out of the service dog law that stated the same thing I telling him, service dog must have required vest on and you can only ask what service your dog provides. He became even more aggressive and continued to yell at me and use foul language, I told him my husband getting his paperwork, he told me "" I don't care if he has an ID, the owner is sick of all those dogs coming, why the Fu@& do you want to bring a dog in to where people eat"" I tried to calm the man down and explain that my dog has to go everywhere with me including a restaurant. The man didn't want to hear anything I or my family had to say about my service dog and the law- I felt myself beginning to have an anxiety attack so my dog and I stepped a way for the situation while my mother called the sheriff department. My mom told me the sherif was on their way to straighten everything out. I came back to tell the man my husband is now coming with his ID  but he turned around and told me "" if your not fu@$en blind then you can't come in with your dog, so fu@$ off"". He walked a way and we waited patiently for the sheriff to arrive, while waiting for them to arrive other customers were telling us they couldn't believe he was treating us like that, one customer said he always gets like that---finally another man that works there came over and told us he was sorry for everything and told us we can come in. The sheriff finally arrived and explained to the man that he was in the wrong and that we were allowed to enter. After the sheriff left the man just won't left it go and he continued to harassed me telling me  ""don't walk your dog where people are eating"" --I replied telling him that I'm allowed to be here with my dog---he them called me a bitch---I still in disbelief that I was treated like this and continued to be harassed by the man even after the sheriff came out and explained to him that it was against the law for him to refuse us to enter---it's sad because I love going to this place and to be treated to badly because I have a service dog---and of all days on Easter when my family and I were there to spend a nice day together"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Unreal!!! So much history here..feels like you're transported to a different state entirely. Love all the rustic buildings and the entire property. Totally unexpected and tucked away....the food is incredible and the service matches (shout out to Grant!). Stop by the gift shop and pick up one of the softest shirts you'll ever feel. Tip- make a reservation if you don't have a lot of time to wait because this place fills up quickly after opening. Can't wait to come back.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,God this place is good. A short drive up to the top of the San Marcos pass and you're back in time. Feels like you're at Knotts Berry Farm. We go every time we're in Santa Barbara
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"A MUST stop for tourists and travelers. Very cool forest vibe, tucked away on a corner near Goleta. 

Fun seating outside, great live music, amazing food, fun people.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Fantastic location, food, and history. What more can one ask for?

LOCATION: 5/5

Cold Spring Tavern is situated north of Santa Barbara's riviera, and finds itself nestled among the mountain's lush forest. The drive up is fairly easy for the most part, as there is a smaller and narrower road right before the tavern itself. The air was crisp and refreshing!

FOOD: 5/5

I'll be completely honest and say that I wasn't expecting too much in terms of food quality- I was sure it's difficult to haul trucks of good ingredients up there! But I was most pleasantly surprised with how delicious our meal turned out to be.

My husband and I chose to split the tri-tip sandwich entrée with a side of their onion rings. They were kind enough to split it onto two plates! The size of the sandwich was definitely perfect for us two.

The tri-tip was incredibly smokey and juicy. The roll it came on was AMAZING in its own right- perfectly buttered, crispy, and soft at the same time. The onion rings were also super crispy and large! 

The sauces were a great addition. I found myself absolutely drowning my sandwich in the barbecue and horseradish ones. One thing I did feel was missing was a palate cleanser/ refreshing condiment, maybe pickles or coleslaw.

SERVICE/ AMBIENCE: 5/5

We were greeted and served by very attentive workers. It was a genuine pleasure to interact with each one. Cold Spring Tavern is most definitely a must-try when in the area and I look forward to visiting again!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cool little place hidden way out in no mans land. Food was good, but came out quick & cold telling me it was cooked earlier and just sitting there waiting for someone to order it. Covid times may be the reason so I give them credit and didn't fault them. staff were very attentive almost too much, but shows their also used to busy times, told it's usually a hour wait however we were one of very few there. I'll give it another shot once Covid leave our flipping life."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Don't go here. We only had the Tri-tip sandwich and it's just meh. To top it off, the two guys cooking the tri-tip were rude and obnoxious. It's fair to say, we won't be coming back. and will be telling all our friends and family not to bother coming here."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This former stagecoach stop has not changed since it was originally built to feed hungry and thirsty travelers going through Santa Barbara to reach their destination.  There is a front sitting room with a warm fireplace to have a beer or two before sitting in the main dining room.  The bar is quite charming, and has quite an appeal among the motorcycle crowd.  The food is your BBQ Tri-tip style with choice of braised or wood-fired and a nice sweet sauce for your Tri-tip sandwich.  The Chef's special is probably the best find however, with today's ribs stacked with french fries of my choice.  The surroundings remind me of an adult Disneyland restaurant, bringing us back to the old west and all that reminds of yesteryear.  The food is great enough to come back for, but the environment in the mountains is well worth the ride too!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Visited this interesting little restaurant in the mountains above Santa Barbara for dinner.
This tavern was once used as a stage coach stop and all the structures on the property have some history which can be found on the menu.
Wish we had arrived earlier so we could have had a walk around the grounds.
I like buildings that have the feel of history in them as this one does.
We were seated at our reservation time (which is required for dinner).
We both ordered the ribs which included a side of green beans and potatoes either roasted or garlic mashed.
The sauce on ribs was just right, with sweet, tart and slightly Spicy flavor with ample amount of meat on the bone.  Green bean freshly sautéed with a little snap to them.
I chose the roasted potatoes, husband the garlic mashed, both were good. 
For desert we shared a Pecan pie which was not too sweet.
Service was good and meal came out in a timely manner.
We would recommend for a night out."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The weekend tri tip is really good. The hours are weird here so I always suggest calling. Great for live music and a change of scenery out of Sb. BUT BEWARE CELL PHONE RECEPTION IS EXTREMELY SPOTTY!!! most the time I don't even count on having any reception but if you walk to the upper end of the parking lot or up the road you'll get some bars. Food is good and the pizza is alright. But I think the tri tip is the best. The tavern and the restaurant are two separate buildings. Super dusty old and...just ""rustic."" The coolest part is that you can actually see the spring seeping out of the hill side! Best time to go i think is mid Saturday afternoon...music and tri tip! Not as many bikers as there once was riding up here but they still come up. I enjoy going here more in summer time...it's get really hot and the tavern has these cool huge removable windows that lets the live music drift into the dimly lit road and fire pit area at night. It's one of my favorite places in summer to party!  The bar tender could be a little more friendly but...Shes the owner so...well... I get it!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The location and ambiance alone are amazing and definitely worth the 25 minute drive or so from Santa Barbara! The excellent food and drinks just make it even better!! Visiting Cold Spring Tavern is like stepping back in time and some of the menu offerings are as unique as the decor. They serve Rabbit loin for goodness sakes! Not that I had that of course, but it was interesting nonetheless.
The complimentary warm, fresh whole wheat and molasses bread was to die for!

If you're looking for an unusual and magical place to spend an evening, have a meal, or some drinks and a dance, and you don't mind venturing a little off the beaten path, you've gotta check out Cold Spring Tavern in the Santa Yñez mountains above Santa Barbara."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I had a great time! Such an interesting and cool spot ..... a real gem. My server Rodrigo was really kind and bubbly. And I have to say ...all the rest of the staff was just great. I ll come back for sure.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This has been my favorite staple in the area for quite a while and bringing visitors here has always caused awe over the perfect scenery and amazing food. This has been my forest post Covid visit and I must say I was incredibly disappointed. We had a reservation for 5 and were seated at a booth for 4 (one person was a child but it was still too crowded). Our table caved into one corner which our host commented on but did nothing about.

The menu is so much smaller now. They don't serve their famous chili during dinner which was so disappointing. I was cheered up when offered French onion soup (my fav!), but the $7 cup was bland, watery, and had one slice of cold cheese on top. They brought two people these. Clearly no fluke. It was disrespectful.

I ordered the ratatouille with risotto. The risotto was essentially over cooked white rice with salted butter in it. No other flavor. No cheese, no garlic, no seasoning, no nothing. Just mushy white rice. It was disgusting. I had to return it."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"How can this place not have 5 stars across the board ?? This place is absolutely  magical . It's legit in the middle of no where and the moment you get there, you feel like you walked into a different era. The place is so well conserved any history junkie would get a kick out of it. Not only is this place esthetically wonderful.... The food is phenomenal . The tri tip, which is what they're known for, is the most delicious piece of meat ever!! I got the grilled cheese which is also drop dead delicious, but I did end up stealing some of my friend's tri tip sandwich. The dishes are not elaborate, but they are totally amazing in all its simplicity.
On a side note, (if you're into beer) the waiter recommend the hoppy poppy, which I had never heard of, and it was delish as well. The prices are totally fair too. You won't break the bank for a great meal. Service was great, everything was great . No complaints here , just love. Kudos to the owner. Visiting this little hidden treasure should be on everyone's to do list."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"There are many things to like and love about this place.  We have been dining at Colt Spring for decades, it is our neighborhood pub.  Will continue to go, but will ask more questions before ordering, like ""how many days have the ribs been sitting under a heat lamp?""

We just (31 Oct, 3 PM) had one of the worst meals I have ever had, seriously, hideous.  It was their BBQ baby back ribs.  They were flavorless, except for a chemical-like taste.  The strange taste reminded me of the aroma of decomposing cardboard and perhaps cleaning products like Comet, seriously.  It may have been over-salted?  There was essentially no meat taste, which I cannot figure out how that was possible.  There is no way those ribs were cooked the same day..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is just the coolest place. I was so amazed at this beautiful location in the woods. The outdoor tables are shady and inviting, and the indoor is beautifully cozy. We ordered the original tri-tip sandwich and also the barbecue tri-tip sandwich. Both were phenomenal. The original comes with a side of apple horseradish sauce that was out of this world. Also the bread is toasted with butter to perfection. The barbecue sandwich is very messy, as you could imagine, but also delicious. I didn't love the game chili as much as I thought I would as a side dish, only because it did not particularly taste like game meat to me. The potato salad was a perfect side, however. I will definitely return both for the wonderful ambience and the delicious sandwiches."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Here we are after following a food blogger for the past month now. First, the place has a its  own character. Old and charming in a rustic way. All raw wood, no paint. It was like a movie set. What with the bikers as main characters. We were looking forward to the foot long tri tip sandwich but I think we made a mistake ordering. What came was like a six inch tri tip sandwich! I would have loved to take a photo a loooonnnngggg sandwich much like what the food blogger had. . Now, the beef was kind of dry and I think we got the very end of the tri tip. Not as tasty or juicy as I was expecting. Next time I order, I will make sure to say that I would like the middle part of the meat and not the end.
I turned my attention to the vegetable salad and onion rings . I like the vegetable salad because the veggies were grilled and the  cranberry dressing was light and refreshing.  I wish they could have placed more.  
The onion rings  which we excitedly waited for were big and good too. We had to box the rest of it because it was too big for us.

Overall , it is a regular sandwich place in a picnic setting. Relaxed and beautiful in its simplicity. 

If you are showing friends around, I think  this is a good place to consider:"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Stopped off here with a couple friends on our way to Santa Barbara. Tucked away in the hills, you'll feel like you should have ditched the Acura for a 19th-century stagecoach. Even on a weekday in February, the parking lot was full and tourists from seemingly all over filled the restaurant and outside picnic tables. Great people watching if you're into parents bickering with their teenage children. 

We ordered the BBQ Beef Sandwich ($10.25, with fries). Oven-roasted rather than grilled (that one costs $13), the meat could have used more time, as it wasn't as tender as it could have been. I love barbecue sauce, but this sandwich more closely resembled a sloppy joe - the meat was completely drowning in it. Some fresh pickles, onions, and tomatoes on the side would have been a nice touch. 

They've got a full bar and a great selection of beers and wine. You can't ask for better scenery - if the weather's nice definitely take the grub outside. Friendly-enough service gets the job done; I'd come back in the future, but probably order something else. 

If you're in the mood for some solid old-West Americana, check em' out."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Best tri-tip sandwich on the planet!  When we are back in the area it's a must stop for us. Can't wait to eat inside the historic and quaint little establishment in the future!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Something cool to come and check out when in the area. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. We wanted inside, but the wait was longer so we sat outside near the hostess table. We didn't get the best seating, but it was pretty busy so we were good with it. They give menus to look at while you wait and there were people walking around serving drinks to people waiting. The servers were all very friendly. 

We ordered the onion rings, chili fries, and tri tip sandwich.
They were out of draft beer, but we were able to get the island blonde in a 22 oz bottle to share. 

It wasn't hands a down, the best I've ever had, make a 2 hour drive to go back kind of meal, but it was good and if I was in the area I could picture coming back."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"If you're camping nearby or heading home back to LA, take a pit stop here! Food is awesome, service is great, and the setting is relaxing. 10/10 would come here again when I'm in the area."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Have been coming to this spot for many many years. This place used to be an old stagecoach stop on the way out west. They still have all the old buildings that were erected hundred plus years ago. Very cool spot to stop and have a drink and some food. They are open for lunch and dinner. They have excellent chili steaks and other American favorites. Very nice location in the middle of the mountains in the forest. If you have the time and you're up in this area definitely stop by look at the grounds get some food and have some drinks.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Cold Springs Tavern is one of my favorite places and I can't believe I never reviewed it. It's special because it's a little cabin hidden in the mountains above Santa Barbara and it feels like it's own little get away. I came up on a cold day to get some chili which was very good and of course to get away from it all. I tried to come back on a Sunday for breakfast but the restaurant was inundated with bikers. I will try to get back up there during breakfast time as I have been wanting to try it.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Okay - the food and drinks are just okay but it's a must-stop and see on your way through SB and up to Santa Ynez. I've been here several times with my family and it's always fun. Walking to the back to see the old jail is cool and the blue jays are very friendly. The staff is wonderful and the service is great! Sitting indoors is also fun, you get the feel of how long it's been around which I enjoy. Definitely stop by if you are on your way up north to do some wine tasting!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My sister heard this place makes the best tri tip sandwiches. On a Saturday afternoon, my family and I drove from LA to here. We drove on the narrow road to the Tavern and reached there by 11am. There was people already there and lots of cars parked on the narrow road.  We put our names on the waiting list by 11:10am and waited till the place was opened at 11:30am to hear our names being called out. The place is so cozy and rustic. Then the hostess took us to our table in the back. Our waiter, Grant was friendly, helpful and great on service. We ordered tri tip with French fries, tri tip w/onion rings, and French dip w/onion rings so the wait wasn't too long.  Once I see our food arrived, the onion rings are huge in size. It also come with small containers of sauces and all handmade-ranch, bbq sauce, apple horseradish, salsa. My tri tip sandwich had thick slices inside which was so tender and juicy with soft and firm bun. The fries was seasoned and soft inside and crispy outside. The back was really nice and could hear bluebirds speak while eating."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,the tri tip sandwich is really REALLY GOOD. im not to fond of the taste of meat but holy ---- it was really good i had to have half of another one! you must try it. it is the best ever. ive only been here a few times and the ribs are also really good. i suggest you try the pie/cheesecake of the day. it is packed on the weekend and finding parking can be a bit difficult but trust me its worth it. its also really nice to walk around they have historical things all around that are really nice to look at and explore after.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Okay so my boyfriend and I came here after Rachel Ray's ""$40 dollars a day"" in Santa Barbara episode premiered on the Food Network. It's good but not really worth the hype or the drive. We went there for breakfast once and I didn't taste anything special. The place is nice though. It seems like it kept with the old tradition. But on that note, whats with all the biker guys outside? And how come it seems like they have never seen an Asian girl before?"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place is such a cool tavern with a nice piece of history!

Ordered the Wild Game Omelette as everyone at our table thought it sounding good: rabbit, venison and buffalo game meats used.  Well, unless you've had any of these 3 meats regularly, putting them all in the omelette made it challenging to try and figure out what's what that you're eating.  Despite this,j it was just OK for me.  Nothing special about it.

I actually enjoyed the side of Biscuit & Gravy, that came with the omelette, much, much more.  Biscuits were light and fluffy,. and with the sausage gravy it was delicious.  

Service was very good."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This is our 3rd time visiting this little gem. As seen on food network many years ago, it's still a place we try to get to when in Santa Barbara. 

Normally I first head for the cocktail list, which here I spy the Cold Spring Spritz. Hubby ordered  a Blonde, beer that is.  Oh, and a starter of their onion rings. I'm a sucker for onion rings. 

Onto the menu. If you come here its usually out of your way but for a reason....the Tri Tip Sandwich. Served with salsa and their homemade Apple horseradish sauce. Can't choose between potato salad or cole slaw, just get both. They're equally delicious. 

The ambiance is outdoorsy, rustic with some blue jays and pesky flying insects. However, I'm never disappointed in the staff and they're inviting and friendly demeanor. I really enjoy all of it. Weekdays are not as busy as weekends but reservations via their website are strongly encouraged.  Relaxing and tummy filling, I can hear our waitress still saying, ""come back ya hear!"""
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Vibe and atmosphere are five stars plus and would come back for that alone. Food however was a major disappointment. Tri-tip was overcooked and flavorless. Fries undercooked. Good bun. Horseradish spread was good.

Nachos had almost no cheese. Salsa was good and so was guacamole and sour cream. 

Kids got dog was enjoyed by the kids. 

Pretty good drink selection and live music was enjoyable. I'll try it again in hopes that food was off that day."

I can't remember the soup n sandwich we had our first trip, but it was ok.  Today we were joined by another couple.  They had the buffalo burger and potato salad.  They seemed very pleased with their choice.  
We had the French dip.  The french dip is notcomposed of roast beef, instead it is tri-tip.  Now I've been eating tri-tip all my life.  I know it's a tough cut of meat that has to be treated in a special way to be tender.  It needs to be marinated, cooked low n slow, and sliced very thinly across the grain---it will melt in your mouth!
I could not bite through, or chew this meat.  It was tough and full of fat and gristle.  Really bad experience.  The French fries were exceptionally good.  Also ordered the tomato Italian soup.  It was ok.
Would have loved to have a glass of wine, but way too expensive.
Doubt that I'll be back again."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Food was great! Definitely did not disappoint. The service was another story. And unfortunately we won't be racioback because of it. The guy greeting guests  was happier we were there than our server was. What I mean is, our server just seemed he didn't want too be there. For a place like this, I just expected an elevated level of service. Never got a refill of my water until I asked. I didn't even know they offered bread and butter until I asked I I could order some. Would have gone great with my chili but I asked once dinner was out.  I definitely felt out of place, it's hard to notice when everyone else is being treated better than we were. Looking around and noticing these things makes you wonder what's up. But again, the food was awesome."

I have been a handful of times being that I live in SB and never had any problems previously.  We had family in town and decided to take them to Cold Springs Tavern for lunch, however, this time we brought our dog with us. After parking, we started walking in when we were stopped by the owner.  He was incredibly rude and condescending, he even said ""can't you read the sign, no dogs allowed"" and ""you could leave your dog at home like everyone else"". I have honestly never encountered rudeness like this from an employee of a restaurant, much less from the owner. We were unaware that dogs were not allowed to be outside. Yes there is a sign- but it is very small and located on the side fence. I have no problem with dogs not being allowed, but there is no excuse for the rude way we were treated. All he had to do was ask nicely and we would have gladly put the dog in the car. After driving 25 minutes to the restaurant, we turned around and walked out. Will not be returning!"

I tried all3, but the horseradish was best! Had the chili for a side.  It was good. My son ordered the bison burger and it was very juicy, nice bun.

It's really a very nice experience to go to an old stage coach stop in the hills outside of Santa Barbara. The old buildings, over 120 years old, are a beautiful touch for some nice West Coast tri-tip barbecue. I'd recommend you get there early because the parking can be difficult as you have to park along the road. This place is extremely popular. And for good reason. The sandwiches were great, the onion rings were perfect, and the general atmosphere is very pleasant. The service was friendly. And it was well worth the short drive north of Santa Barbara. You should go, you will have a very interesting experience."

The restaurant reminded me of a set from Shrek and actually being there aligned with my expectations (minus the ogres). I really appreciated nature's calm for the ambience that really ignited the presence and appreciation of the food and birds fluttering around. Although it was extremely hot outside, there was plenty of shade at the tables and our waiter was always quick to refill our cups. 

The customer service was amazing! My partner and I split one of our entrees and the waiter and staff were so accommodating that they put it on 2 different plates for us :) 

Oh yes-and the food was fresh, the meat wasn't dry, and we finished every last bite! The wonderful mix of environment, customer service, and food is worth every penny spent. I will be this to recommending to all friends passing by or in Santa Barbara. Thanks so much for a great experience !"

Locally owned, not part of a chain, the menu is small but cherch. They serve tri-trip on a hoagie style french roll, but for the slightly more adventurous, there is both buffalo and venison options.  Turned out, this meal was a bit of a test of me by my BF for how adventurous a travel companion I'd be.  I passed with full colors because I immediately selected both the venison meat on a french bread roll and their homemade potato salad.  The BBQ sauce tasted homemade or gourmet, not just mass produced.  The lightly grilled Spanish red onions made it delicious. 

He selected a bowl of the venison black bean chili followed by the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie. We dubbed the pie, ""Drunken Nuts,"" his having eaten here numerous times before.  The slice is large and generous and served with little whipped cream along the pie crust.  It just tasted rich and delicious, the alcohol didn't come through too strongly.  Both lunches were incredibly yummy.  

Note, the menu at their website (http://coldspringtavern.com/lunch.html) is not 100% accurate.  The prices are a few dollars higher, and the offerings are different by 1-3 items.  Still, representationally accurate.

Cold Spring Tavern also features a full small bar area, featuring local craft beers.  This is a favorite haunt of bikers and cyclists because the San Marcos pass is such a wonderful curving drive with glorious views.  Just 12-14 miles outside of Santa Barbara, the weather is a few degrees cooler here than at the shore because of all the dappled shade offered by the trees.  The bathrooms are in an outside building just steps from the tavern, making it very friendly to local riders just to stop and use the facilities if they need to, but just about everyone stops in to greet the friendly staff and enjoy a cool beverage of choice. 

With the severe area drought, you do need to order water, and feel free to refill your water bottle from your glass before leaving. Because of the drought, much of the creek is dried up and you can see that with the terrain across the road how dry it is now. 

Lunch is served until 3PM.  After that, if there's still some chili leftover, you can get a bowl, but not the menu items from the grill.

Take a small stroll out towards the bridge, and you'll enjoy burning off some of the calories.

With the glorious vistas and the feel of getting away from civilization, the venue is fantastic and food exceptional.  We will definitely venture out here again and again."

Great food, ambience and service. Prices are decent and its totally worth the drive. Stop in for a drink at their bar and listen to love music and enjoy. I recommend the onion rings, chili and tri tip!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,Came after reading reviews and hearing it was good. Well our experience no so great. I had the not so famous tri tip sandwich. Dry thick and overcooked. Asked for rare as possible and got well done. Had to drown it in bbq sauce to get it down. Wife had tortilla soup bland and not very good. Had a couple beers that were good and very cold. FYI if you go get there early unless you want to park on a narrow mountain road. Also get reservations unless you want to wait a long time. The grounds were very nice and pretty cool. Will I go back hell no.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,Drove 2 1/2 hours to eat here and they where very rude to my friends they tried calling 3 days ahead to make reservations and no answer for multiple days and just by the way my friends are Mexican and soon as some white people showed up they where very friendly to them and accommodating
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"I've been here probably 50 times over the past 25ish years, and a little healthy criticism is a bit overdue for this place. Food has gone way down hill and prices way up, service is awful and often times leaves you getting seated after groups that got there after you, LA tourists everywhere, motorcycles constantly driving by and idling their engines, smokers everywhere. It's kind of a nightmare here tbh. More of a tourist trap than a locals spot or whatever."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,Although the food was good and the setting was nice. I got food poisoning after eating either the chili cheese fries or the Tavern burger.

It's been over a week, and, my husband and I are still talking about the Cold Spring Tavern.

Here is a little history:
What is now the Cold Spring Tavern began operating as a stagecoach stop in 1868.   The original structure is believed to have been built in 1860 and included the Long Room, RV Room and Kitchen.  Ownership of the Tavern during the early years is not well documented.  Records indicate the Doulton family purchased 160 acres, including the Tavern, for $10 in 1900.  The Doulton's  transferred  ownership in 1907 to the Miramar Corporation, which went bankrupt and lost the mortgage in 1934. Caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Green, oversaw the property until early 1941.
Adelaide Ovington, a former actress and writer, purchased 40 acres surrounding the Tavern in 1941 for $2,000.  She said ""I want to buy that door and whatever comes with it!""   She was also the wife of Earle Ovington, a Santa Barbara aviation pioneer and the first United States airmail pilot.  Adelaide ran the Tavern alongside her daughter, Audrey Ovington, until her death in 1972.  Audrey, a legendary personality and writer, was the sole proprietor until her death in 2005.  Wayne and Joy Ovington Wilson, third generation and current owners, take pride in maintaining the Tavern in its historical state.

We checked in with the receptionist, and wandered around the property. Fred, a grandson of Adelaide Ovington, caught our eye as we explored the living history.  He told us stories about his grandmother and the history behind the various buildings on the property. Here, you can appreciate the true history of the old stagecoach days.

When I asked about his menu recommendations, he told us they are known for their Buffalo Burger as well as the Tri-Tip and Ribs. My husband and I both wanted a burger, so to try two menu items, we ordered the Buffalo Burger and the Tavern Burger and split them.. Hands down, the Buffalo Burger is a 5-star. Tasty. Mild. Perfectly cooked. The fries were also delicious, but the cole slaw needed seasoning.
Buffalo Burger:  charbroiled half pound of 100%  buffalo, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle, cheese (cheddar, jack, swiss)
Tavern Burger:  charbroiled half pound angus sirloin, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, cheese (cheddar, jack or swiss)

Yummy and finger-licking good!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I must get their chili recipe. I've been to chili cook offs and Cold Spring's chili is the best chili I've ever had. Something about their flavor combination are the best ever. It is intoxicatingly good food.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place is awesome! It's out in the middle of nowhere in the mountains above Santa Barbara in an old stagecoach stop. There's a restaurant and separate bar. We got drinks at the bar while we waited for a table in the restaurant. The decor and vibe inside gives it the feel that it's still an old stagecoach stop. They're known for their tri-tip sandwiches and they were definitely delicious. We'll go back next time we're visiting SB and try the nachos. We were eyeing them from the table next to us and they looked amazing.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Such a cool, hidden spot! We stopped briefly on the way to SLO and were amazed to find this historic restaurant in an otherwise remote area. The setting is beautiful, you'll see lots of Blue Jays flying around, and can appreciate nature while you grab a drink or bite to eat. Will definitely be back!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"One of the best and most unique stops for food, drink, music.  There is nothing to compare this place to. It is a step off the hamster wheel, a step back in time. The smell of a smoldering oak log and meat on the BBQ. This place is nestled in the trees off a tiny little road not far from Lake Cachuma.  You will find classic cars and motorcycles in the parking areas.  If you are driving the California coast, put extra time on the calendar to stop here. Also, be sure to check out the town of Solvang on the North end.  Cold Springs Tavern is a must!  I have stopped here many times over the past 30 years."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"The most beautiful and atmospheric restaurant I've ever seen in California.  This is not a Disney version of the old west - this is the real thing.  Gorgeous setting, beautiful decor, good food, and good service.  Great place to bring your out-of-town friends.  Be sure to explore the various old buildings after your meal."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"We have been patrons of Cold Spring Tavern for many years now. We actually drove 200 miles from LA on a whim just to enjoy the rustic atmosphere. Upon our arrival, we were immediately accosted by a man barking at us ""no dogs on the weekend"". Astounded by how aggressive he was (we were just walking by!), we asked him to repeat. He screamed at us ""No dogs! We don't want a hundred of them! No dogs!""  

Ok..... this guy is in my face yelling at me, on a public road, that my dog is not allowed in the restaurant we had not even started to get close to. What. The. Hell?!

Pete (we certainly asked for his name) was SO incredibly rude and menacing, we will absolutely never, ever return to this place. Disgusting human being. 

Note: I am not even commenting on the ""no dog on the weekend"" policy, that is the owner's call. But NO ONE should be talked to the way I was talked to."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,I love this place! It's sooo cute. People are so friendly and the food is just delicious. Never disappoints.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Sadly, I didn't get the chance to eat here because I came with my parents and my dog and my mom's dog and when we arrived there was a sign that said NO DOGS. This includes their outdoor seating. We had made a reservation in advance to celebrate Father's Day and drove up from an hour away to go here. They said we could get tri tip sandwiches instead and eat in the parking lot. Hard pass. We had checked Yelp and it currently says that dogs are allowed. If you had time to make a sign outside, you had time to update Yelp and your website. I just rechecked their website and it says nothing about dogs being banned. It was almost 100 degrees so leaving dogs in the car was absolutely out of the question. Please update your website and Yelp to reflect your new policy. I don't think I'll be going out of my way to come back; this experience left a bad taste in my mouth."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"I've been driving San Marcos pass for years trying to shave a few minutes off the 101 route.  A couple of years ago when I was using the Google maps app to track my time, I noticed the icon for Cold Springs Tavern off to the left (was going north) so I decided to turn off on the old Stagecoach Rd. to take a look. I was wondering if there really was something on this narrow road.  I was excited to see that there actually was a restaurant and decided someday,  I'll slow down enough to stop by for a meal.  FYI, It reconnects to San Marcos Pass a few miles down so it's not too far off the beaten path. 

We had lunch but unfortunately with no dining inside and social distancing, I could not really see or get the whole feel of this place.

I had the pulled pork sandwich and my wife had the chicken breast sandwich.  They were good but became really good once we put their home made BBQ sauce on it.  I'm not sure why the don't provide this on the side but it made a big difference on enhancing the flavor. 

Hopefully, on my return trip,  life will be normal maybe so I can explore the inside of this historical complex."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"This place is great to check out for the experience.  When was the last time you ate some BBQ in a forest by a babbling brook?  Plus the staff was nice and they took COVID seriously.  So I wanted to like this place. 

But the BBQ itself was disappointing. The tri-tip was chewy, the sandwich bread was bland, and the BBQ ribs were dried out.  Not worth the ~$40 it cost. The fries were good though. 

If you want to come here for the experience, I'd order something small to share, and then go into Santa Barbara to eat."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Such a cool place. Off the beaten path for sure, but definitely still busy and for good reason. The history is awesome and the food is even better. Highly recommend the tri tip French dip. The only disappointment was the $2 upgrade to onion rings with my sandwich came with literally 4 onion rings. They're delicious, but I expected more than 4. Next time will order them as a starter instead. All in all, it's fantastic. Expect to wait. Got there 20 minutes before they opened and still had to wait almost half an hour for a table. It's popular for a reason."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern is truly a Central Californian institution.  Heck, Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing was sold HERE first to the public (don't pass up a tossed salad with ranch dressing)!  A visit hear is like going back in time to a Western but with lush green trees and ivy.  The actual Cold Spring barely has more water than a dribble and is next to the Log Cabin Bar, but it's now a namesake.
Verbatim from the historical plaque: ""In 1886, This tavern was known as 'Cold Spring Relay Station."" It was the half-way stop between ""Mattei's Tavern"" to the north, and Patrick Kinevan's ""Summit House"" to the south. In those days, sturdy stagecoaches known as ""mudwagons"" traveled the rugged San Marcos Pass. It was here horses were changed and passengers rested and enjoyed the noon. In 1900 the Doulton Family bought the Old Tavern with its adjoining 40 acres. In 1941 they sold it to the Ovington Family whose daughter Audry Ovington owns it to this day.""  

Everyone comes to Cold Springs for their Tri Tip Sandwich ($10) barbecue held weekends starting at 11:00 AM with live bands and music, and motorcycle gangs.  The sandwich is on a perfectly soft bolillo bun, zesty barbecue and horseradish cream sauces and the meat keep it to the bare basics.  It doesn't stop at the Tri Tip Sandwiches, bite your teeth into their humongous beer-battered onion rings, lean venison meat sandwich, and chili sampler.  It's the home of comfort food!

Pass time by grabbing a boozy beverage at the Log Cabin Bar and checking out the small on-site Antique Shop, old Ojai Jail (behind the restaurant) and the San Marcos Pass Bridge down the road.
Whenever I have guests come in town, Cold Spring Tavern is always a stop."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My boyfriend has been wanting to take me here since we met. He planned an entire day around Cold Spring Tavern. 

Little did I know just how beautiful this location is. 

Nestled in a forest, with air slightly misty and overcast, we sat at one of the best tables all cuddled up. An ice cold beer and onion rings for starters, and then their famous tri tip sandwiches with delicious sauces. Followed was the hot apple cobbler. 

Being surrounded by the lively forest, on an overcast and chilly Saturday afternoon, eating comfort food, made this a lovely day."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring's Tavern is such a fun hidden gem of the Santa Barbara mountains that has been around forever! Everytime I have come up here I have always had a great experience and I look forward to bringing all my friends that visit town here. Sometimes it can be colder up here since it's surrounded by trees so make sure to bring a jacket with you! 

Everytime I come here is usually on the weekends because they have live music. Sunday's are the best time to come here to grab one of their fresh famous $11 tri tip sandwiches! They have the best fries and onions rings in the restaurant too so if you want a side grab some of those too.

The past Sunday my friends and I came up here to get out of SB for a few hours! We arrived and found parking pretty quickly. Sometimes the parking can be a bit crazy so I would recommend to park when you see a spot on the way down the hill to Cold Springs. You have to walk a little bit sometimes but trust me it's worth it. 

When we arrived this past Sunday we actually found parking right away which was awesome! We headed to the bar grabbed a beer and each got a ticket for the famous tri tip sandwich. They have some local breweries on tap which is awesome and they even have some other speciality beers bottled. We headed to the bbq got our sandwiches and loaded them up with their famous bbq sauce. They have a spicy salsa and a creamy horseradish sauce that go well on the sandwich too. The meat is so tender that it melts right in your mouth. It's so juicy and delicious! This totally makes the drive up here worth it. We stayed for a while listening to the live bands and enjoying our time up here.  

I'm already looking forward to coming back again on another weekend soon! Hopefully on a Sunday so we can get some more tri tip! :)"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Delicious food and fun atmosphere!  My husband had the buffalo burger with a side of chili verde and I had the tri tip sandwich.  They were both delicious!!!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Nice little tucked away gem for a bite, beers and plenty of eye candy. 

Cold beers served up with a warm smile by the Wicked Witch of the West.  

Yummy tri tip sammies served up without a smile by Señor Crabapple and his son Señorito Crabapple. 

But to get there, you must watch out for all those whacked out, stressed out, disrespectful shit bird race car drivers on Highway 154 trying to pass each other like rats in a high strung race that is life in SoCal.

Good times with my SoCal homies."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Love the rustic old western look of this place. The chili and grilled cheese is delicious. Also, you can't go wrong with their onion rings. Some of the best I've ever had."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Service was great! The fresh catch, halibut was spot on. Most of all the atmosphere is magical. I hope to be back soon."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Special vibe, especially with live music.  You drive up what appeared to be a desolate road and start seeing all these cars on the side of the road.  The tavern is in 2 small structures - 1 is the bar and the other is the restaurant.  The place was packed with wait of an hour so we ordered tri-tip sandwiches and onion rings to eat on the bench tables outside.  To order the tri-tip, you pay at the bar and take your ticket to a tent outside where the sandwiches are prepared.  

Everyone raved about the  tri-tip sandwich. You get 3 thick cuts, with self serve horseradish and BBQ sauce.  The meat was medium rare, tender and moist, served on a great roll that was a little crusty but super soft.  The onion rings came in a large portion that can serve 4 easy.  It was very good.  

It's definitely worth a visit. It's so unique and the food measured up to the rating."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,This place is amazing! Live music and amazing food. Of course we tried the tri-tip sandwich with fries! It is a must go!

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This place that me and my girlfriend went to has really good food.

I had the BBQ ribs with coleslaw and the meat just fell off the bones and my girlfriend had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, also very tasty.

We also shared a Apple Cobbler dessert...yummy.

There was also a folk band playing outside, and there are tables outside as well as inside.

The restaurant also has a full bar and there is another separate bar as well. There is also a small gift shop there to buy jewelry.

the place has plenty of trees, but the parking is limited, so you might find yourself parking on the side of the road and walking a bit.

We got lucky and found a place to park in the parking lot., 

We will go back here again..."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We stopped here along the way to wine country for some lunch. It's such a cute little place. There was a pretty extensive line even before they opened which could be due to the fact that it was Valentine's Day. Ordering was easy and the staff was very friendly. Right now they allow carry out and take away. They also have picnic tables outside the restaurant that are first come, first serve. We ordered our food and settled into our picnic table to chow down. 

We ordered the Original Cold Spring Tri Tip sandwich. It comes with all three house made sauces (barbecue, apple horseradish, and salsa) on the side. The fries were good and the onion rings were REALLY good! 

Parking is available along the side of the road. There's also two dedicated spots for take out right next to the store if you're planning just to grab and go. There are real bathrooms here and they are clean. Cell phone reception is spotty here which isn't surprising but just be aware. 

Their website has all the details of the history of this place and their menu. There are a bunch of different buildings I'd love to explore on the grounds. I would love to come here again once they're up and running their full dining service."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Hopefully this place is open. They have a fantastic restaurant menu and a beer/wine menu that'll complement whatever you order. If ya don't feel like waiting for indoor dining, the tri tip on the outdoor BBQ, no waiting. This a great pace to spend an afternoon with family/friends."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"This was quite possibly the best meal I've had -- at least it is the best I can recall. Cold Spring Tavern is a throwback and an extraordinary find. In the hills on the San Marcos pass it is just minutes from downtown Santa Barbara, yet it feels like you're a thousand miles away. The setting is perfect and then there's the meal...unbelievable. We had mushrooms stuffed with a venison sausage broiled and served with a sherry mushrom broth. My wife had an albondigas soup that was sublime. I had a green salad with house made ranch dressing, and learned that the very first ranch dressing was served in this very restaurant (which, by the way, is only a short distance from Hidden Valley of ranch dressing fame!). For our entrees I had wild boar chops with a fig Cabernet demi glace. Stephne had the local wild halibut baked with a light curry sauce and topped with crushed pecans. They were both transcendant meals that we will long remember. Matty, our host and server, was exactly what you're looking for when you're out: a font of local insight and an understanding of good food, coupled with pride of place. Cold Spring Tavern is a rare find that should not be overlooked. If you're searching for Old California or just the best damned meal of your life, look no further."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Good food and a great location. This place has been around forever and eating here sends you back in time. Definitely a Santa Barbara gem, I came here for the first time today. 

Although a meat-heavy restaurant, they had a veggie burger option- and it actually tasted great! I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and size of the burger. It didn't seem like a half-assed menu option and they certainly put effort into making it well. The rest of my friends enjoyed their food, and one got a tri-tip sandwich (what they are known for) and loved it! Came for the ambiance but the good food and service was a huge plus too!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Came by around 3 pm after the lunch rush which was ideal because it was lively, but not over crowded. Live music was available on Saturday which added to the whole tavern vibe and this is my 3rd visit so far. I always opt for their tri tip sandwich since that is what they are known for and you can't go wrong with it! You can order ala carte currently for $13, but I prefer to sit down so that for $17, you can get seated and it comes with a side. The sandwich was packed and the fries were delicious. Our server was so sweet and brought us all 3 sauces, and any extras or ranch if you'd like as well. BBQ, Apple horseradish, and salsa were all great and I enjoyed them all. 
Tri tip is cut big though, so there's some chew. Bread was really crunchy and well toasted.

Also tried their wild game chili and it was ok. The flavors taste like a fresh chili, but the spices don't make it that distinguishable between beef or pork. piping hot so be careful! Good to try if you're craving chili. 

I got food coma after."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"We came on a recommendation and it was worth it. This off the beaten path rustic tavern is a step back in time. We went at lunch on a Friday and it was not crowded but we were not alone. There is so much history in the bar and tavern as a stagecoach stop, not to mention some of the other buildings on the property including the Ojai jail & the Chinese gang house.  Live music on the weekends! Parking is limited be prepared to walk. 
The BBQ was delicious! 
I had the tri-tip sandwich with BBQ sauce and onion rings. I split it with my sister and we each only got 2 onion rings! Kinda skimpy. They were delicious I wish I had a few more."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Awesome tri tip beef... With or without sauce. 
The green chili is killer as well.  Potato salad was yummy,  too.  Portions are very generous. This place has all kinds of places to eat,  inside or out."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Came here recently after hearing from a friend what a cool place this is. Tri tip is great, music and atmosphere great. Flys everywhere not so great!! I realize some of the dining is outside but sheesh, nothing like trying to enjoy your meal while swatting flys away. A note to out of town visitors: As stated on another website by a reviewer DO NOT attempt to drive the road to the Tavern with an RV or large truck/van, IT IS TOO NARROW!!!!! Best only by car or motorcycle. Most parking is along the narrow (and I mean narrow road!!)."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a wonderful Sunday evening at Cold Spring Tavern for our group of four! The restaurant was a quiet haven, even though the tavern was happy, wild and busy! The menu has great choices and the service was super! My stuffed, boneless chicken was absolutely 5-star delicious!!

Lunch time brings a lot of biker types, but the dinner was very different -- more upscale. Took our Daughter & Son-In-Law here and it was very,very good!! Been here at night, been here through the day -- always delightfull!!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Cold Spring Tavern, how the hell did I find you? You are a hidden treasure in California. You are in the middle of nowhere. You are definitely a food run worth doing.

Upon arriving at Cold Spring was a surprised how rustic the place was. Untouched by progress, untamed foliage surrounding it, and an unadulterated joy to visit. The buildings and the surrounding area was a sight to behold. Not many other places have a fraction of personality that this place has. It is definitely a unique experience and one that you won't find at many other places. 

We sat down at the restaurant portion of the place and was delighted. It was a very quaint little place and the food was very good. I myself had the venison cooked rare of course and it was just delightful. Tender and juicy paired well with the vegetables and potatoes. It was a very good meal.The venison was still tender and juicy which is great. I've had venison that was overcooked a tad and it gets tough and dry relatively quick; here it was just the way I like it. 

After we enjoyed our meal we made our way to the bar and band area where a live country band was playing. This is the real beauty of the place is the overall experience. Playing to its strengths and community. Live, local band playing music and everything enjoying and dancing along to the music. The sense of community here was amazing. When you have people who all enjoy the food and drinks together and also enjoy the music and dancing together then you have a very unique and beautiful place to visit.

Would I come here again? I definitely would. Would I recommend this place to my friends and family? Yes I already have. This place is amazing. Don't miss out on this experience, you are going to enjoy every minute of this place."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Incredible place to have dinner, and probably any other meal. Wonderful staff and food was extremely well prepared. Even let me replace side with non menu item. Atmosphere is really comfortable and has that bucolic feeling of almost being animated. Takes a bit of a drive to get there, but scenery is spectacular, so worth it. Everything impressive even the water they serve from there very own spring."

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Once you find this hidden gem you are whisked away to a surreal world.  The food is amazing.  You must try the chili sampler and have a drink by the fire place!  Such a special place!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Waited an hour for a average trip tip sandwich, everyone sitting around us that was seated after us got their food before us.

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Absolute best tri tip in the world! I lived in SB for 7 years and overtime I go back I have to eat here. It's best on a Sunday because they cook tri tip outside and they have live music. It can get a little crowded and its a drive up the 154 but its worth it!
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Love this little piece of history nestled into the 154 hwy of Santa Barbara! It's not fancy so don't go for looks. There's some great piece of old country in this place. I only had the most popular tri tip sandwich and that wasn't great at all. I'm a carnivorous person so I pretty much know my meat well. This was over cooked , tasted like plastic, and not much of flavor to it at all. Salsa made it tasty tho. Fries, not seasoned. Just regular fries. Other than that , the place is beautiful , breath taking , and absolutely a gem of history! I will definitely return to try other stuff on menu. Service was good being we were only the 3rd table there, but go during the week. Weekdays are packed , parking is slim, but if you want an eventful time , definitely go see live bands play there! Will try it out again if I'm near the area"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,ENCHANTING. Straight out of a story book . The atmosphere is so unique. The history of this place is so cool . Food was great . Can't wait to go back (try the chili )
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"Absolutely beautiful location. 

Staff attitude ranges from disinterested to abrupt then simply rude. The dudes making the sometimes delicious, sometimes overcooked tri-tip are equally rude. 

It's such a nice place that I would come here even if they punched me in the face once or twice. But really--wow--they are bloody assholes. And prices are high. Way too high for what you get. 

What a shame. I imagine the old owner who you see around in pictures was a very different sort of person. Nevertheless, it's worth a visit."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"First of Alllll, Cold Spring Tavern gets 5 for location and ambiance. Nestled and tucked away in the woods , it doesn't get any better for a Cozy "" or Romantic dinner. It's also a great place for families to come-up and have a great breakfast or lunch.With that said..., the several times we've been here the food has not been to it's full potential.We came for Father's Day, and our server said ,they stop serving breakfast at 11:00 am. It was 10:45 so we ordered right away. They said, if you wanted to order off the lunch menu ,you would have to wait till 11 AM ,we said OK considering my daughter wanted a burger and my wife and I,  were both having breakfast.We ordered at 10:46 am and we didn't get our plates till 11:30 , we were waiting for my daughters burger to arrive, and she didn't get it till 11:50 ""UNBELIEVABLE!!! The waitress was nowhere to be seen after our order, neither did she come by and apologize for the long wait. The Onion-Rings , which we ate by the way ""Amazingly Delicious ,"" also took a 1/2 hour to arrive. Last time we were there we ordered their Tri-Tip sandwich which is one of their signature plates. NOT EVEN !!!! the Tri -Tip was dry, it was either cooked to long, or was left unattended. The burger was nothing to brag about, but again the onion -rings were delicious with there in-house RANCH"". The breakfast burrito (wild boar , pork & sausage was packed with potatoes and probably and 2/eggs, very poorly served. The salsa was fresh and tasty that came with it, and the wild boar chili that they pour over it was flavorful and tasty. The star of your plate , should not be the chili they pour over the main dish. Aside from that ,I do have to say the "" wheat molasses French toast"", is the star here .. a "" MUST !!!"" The homemade buttermilk biscuit was also really good. I'm not sure we'll be back for lunch , maybe breakfast for the French toast, but I'm willing to give them a chance for dinner... to see what that is all about.All -in All..., this place is a beautiful place to dine at, with plenty of parking all along the ridge , unfortunately I wish I could say the same for all their/food, only the few things the really stood out in which I n"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,Very cool place to stop for a drink or lunch. It's a short distance off the highway. The tri tip sandwich was as good as advertised. I'd also recommend the the chili sampler and onion rings. Full service inside or you can order food to take outside where they have many picnic tables. It's a 15 min drive from Cachuma lake.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,"To say that we were disappointed is an understatement.

I came with a large party (about 15 people), and we were escorted to a more private room off to the side.

It took over 30 minutes for any server to even greet us, let alone take our drink and food orders. It felt like we had been forgotten. One of us had to physically get up and wave somebody down. After we received our drinks, he never came back to refill our water.

Four people from our group arrived about 30 minutes later than the rest of us, and I was both perplexed and annoyed to see them receive their food before we did.

To add insult to injury with the poor service, my food was burned. I didn't send it back because at that point I was so hungry that I didn't want to wait another hour to have it remade.

An hour later, our server came by to take our plates and ask if we wanted boxes. 20 minutes after that, he came back - no boxes. We had to ask for boxes again.

We also had to ask for our check 3 times. I had to physically walk up to the register for them to finally print it.

I have never received such poor service in my life. Honestly, I've received better service at Jack-In-The-Box with stoned teenagers.

I was so excited about trying this place because I heard such wonderful things about it, but our experience was a major letdown."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"You don't encounter many middle-of-nowhere restaurants nowadays that have great food, live music, and a 100 year history. Perfect for date night or a friends get-together, it's a rustic quaint location tucked away in the Santa Ynez mountains adjacent a bubbling brook. My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place and it's been one of our most memorable and favorite date nights since.

It used to be a stagecoach resting area back in the 1800's, which then turned in to a restaurant/ tavern. The restaurant is actually a small-ish log cabin with a creepy-sounding squeaky front door. Walking into the tavern felt like you had gone back in time as everything inside looked like it had come from that era. I hear it can be difficult to get a table and reservations are highly recommended. But there's always ordering to-go or taking your chances and hoping someone cancels so you can get a table for 2 at 8 pm like we did. 

We ordered the charbroiled new york steak, medium rare, which came with green beans and mashed potatoes and a salad with lingonberry dressing. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Will definitely be back for this order! We also had the hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps as dessert. 

In a separate shack, they've got a small bar area and live music on most weekends. You can count on us being back!"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Wow! What a surprise! This spot on a early Saturday morning was excellent service, breakfast, and local customers with suggestions. We got the rancheros plate, biscuits & gravy, and the breakfast burrito all were well prepared! I'm looking forward to my next visit."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,negative,Was there with some friends for breakfast we was a large party of 8 on a Sunday we ordered our meals which took a very long time to arrive and we had to look for them to get a refill of coffee and a refill for our teas sorry to say but the service was bad.The food itself was pretty good.Good portions my favorite part was sitting next to one of their fire places.Hope to go there again with better service.
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"After a long drive or day just enjoying SB, Cold Spring Tavern is a homey little place to rest your feet and enjoy a cabin-like feel. 

I've come here for the Tri Tip Sandwich on the weekends for lunch. It is a  must and a tradition for us. 

THis time around, we came for dinner.

Reservations can be made via email. Just go on their websIte and they have the contact us page. You can send them your reservation inquiry. Took about a day for them to respond to me. :) 

We got the Venison Sausage Stuffed Mushroom. Very good! As the name sounds, it's mushrooms w meatball-like bits and some cheese~ good app! 

My husband got the venison and I got the rabbit. The venison didn't taste gamey. The rabbit was veRy juicy surprisingly - reminded me of chicken a little bit. Hahaha :) 

The chili was  yummy! A little kick to it! I got the squash soup, which was just perfect for the super cold weather. 

Bathroom is outside in a separate building. 

Parking - there's a lot of space to park along the mountainy sidelines. 

Not pet friendly based on the signs around  the area. 

We sat inside the restaurant so we weren't near the live  music that happens in the evenings."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"My husband has apparently been looking for this place for years. He kept telling me ""there's a secret restaurant under a bridge somewhere!"" I just assumed he was crazy,  but turns out he isn't... On our way to Santa Barbara one day I told him I would help him find it. And we were successful! Very cool location.  And very cool atmosphere,  even during social distancing it was still very cool.  

They had plenty of outdoor seating and they were offered indoor as well. We chose indoor since it was a shorter wait time,  and we were the only people eating in our section of the restaurant,  so we felt completely comfortable. 

As far as the food it was pretty good.  I must admit I was not expecting the meat for the French dip to be so thick,  but it was still pretty good.  And my husband said his grilled cheese was pretty sweet.  So,  no complaints.  Nothing mind blowing through either.  

All in all it was a good experience."
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"Great atmosphere, out in the woods, feels like East Coast, great indoor dining, food is fresh and fabulous, staff is friendly and quick, definitely a must go to place"
0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,American,positive,"What a treat. We're camping about 20 minutes away in Buellton at the Flying Flags RV Resort with friends staying at the Rancho Oso Thousand Trails RV Park, who kept telling us about this out of the way gem. 

Well we met today for lunch and were immediately taken in by the old Stage Coach stop originally known as the ""Cold Springs Relay Station"".

The menus offers many traditional meats as well as a few exotic ones like Buffalo, Wild Boar, Elk, Pheasant, Rabbit and Venison.  Try their Tri of chili...ummmmmm.  The daily specials looked great, to include a pair or Quiches.

The settings take you back 120+ years, where you can relax under a lush green canopy of old growth forest and enjoy the spring coming out the side of the hill between moss covered stones.

If you find yourself in the hills between Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez then take the time to find this secret hide/a-way"
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,I love this place... Food is decent through the bar and grill... The brunch is great... But nowhere close that is better to get drinks and enjoy beautiful grass fairways and magnificent ponds and waterfalls from a clubhouse... Great service... Incredible to watch sunset with the great views of the ocean
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,negative,"well I have been to the Frog Bar a few times and finally decided to review it.

Decided to take my team out for a good job kinda lunch (i know im a great boss arent i)  they decided on this place

I have to say that I do really like the food here-  everyone at our table really liked the food-  not one complaint about the food itself....

....but dear god man please explain how it takes an hour for 2 burgers, one chicken sandwich, and a veggie gyro (that was mine) to get turned out.   This was pretty much unacceptable, especially since they were not even close to being totally booked.  

We were not the only table that this was the happening too, it actually appears to be the norm for this joint.  One of our party even commented that this was the same experience they had before..

so for a work lunch, this place is out, unless you want to use slow service as an excuse for taking an extra long lunch

again the food was great, but cant go over 3 stars when it takes that long.."
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,"Food and view was great. We came here in a big group and they accommodated everyone really well. Great service, food and view. I had the tacos. Pretty good:)"
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,"Come for the view, not necessarily for the food or service.

The Frog is a great lunch place when you want to kick back and enjoy the scenery. The food is average having tried most of the dishes on the menu. Notably the Ruben @ $11 and Arizona burger for a buck more but I usually order the Santa Fe Chicken Croissant for $12. It's a solid sandwich with plenty of flavor from the avocado, bacon and jack cheese. The chicken does not come out dry so that's a plus. 

You're situated overlooking the rolling hills of Glen Annie with the ocean and islands in the distance. There's usually a breeze which is nice on our warm summer days. A large patio with tons room and shade is where you'll find me but there's also a bar and tables inside should you be sun beaten on the back nine.

Service is slow. Expect a full hour to order, eat and pay so it's not good for a tight, 60 minute lunch. I go on days I can stretch an hour and a half. While they've always been more than polite and accommodating, there does not seem to be a large staff so it just takes a while. My vote's a three out of 5 but with the view, that rates another star. 

No worries on the wait, have another Arnold Palmer and stare out at the water. I'll probably sitting at the table next to you."
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,"This was the venue of my boyfriend's company Holiday Party for 2018 and i was very impressed with our overall experience.  To start, the location is beautiful, staff were tops and the food... OMG!! Perfect location for an intimate event.  Highly recommended and we will definitely come back.  Good job to everyone!"
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,negative,"2.5 stars

4 stars for the view
2 for the food (which should average out to 3, but I'm also factoring in $ value)

Any time we have a work outing, we come here. The views are beautiful and if the weather is nice, it's great to sit outside and soak up the sun, or the shade if so inclined (they've got some big umbrellas). Although it's on a golf course, any one can come here and partake of their restaurant facilities. There is a lot of space and they easily accommodate our party that fluctuates between 7-15 people. The staff are hospitable and are good about seating accommodations. But here comes the fine print: this is NOT the place to come for a quick lunch. It is not uncommon to receive your food an hour (plus) after it's been ordered. (This isn't necessarily dependent on the number of patrons either, so don't be fooled if you come here and there aren't that many people dining.)

I've been here 3 times in the last few months. The first time I had the Reuben, which was pretty good. Nothing too extraordinary about it, but it's pretty pricey for lunch at $11, especially when there are several sandwich places around here.

The next time I had the Oriental Chicken salad. A coworker got this last time and it looked tasty. Based on her experience, I ordered the dressing on the side. When she got her food, she asked for another huge bowl of cabbage. Even after mixing that into her existing salad, everything was drenched in dressing. Overall, it's a pretty simple salad, consisting of cabbage, crispy wonton strips, cashews and a pineapple sesame dressing. Although it seemed really great at the time, it's a little too simple for $13.

On to the third time. After perusing the menu, I decided on the pinko crusted halibut tacos with tortilla soup. This comes with 2 tacos that are pretty big, stuffed with shredded cabbage, some pineapple salsa and avocado aioli. Although the size is pretty good, it was bland. The pineapple was fresh and even numbed my tongue a little, but it was nothing to write home about... The soup was thick with some diced avocado, tortilla strips and tons of cheese. It would have been helpful to have some scissors as the string of cheese never seemed to end. Even with that said, I'd also have to go with just an ""ok"" rating, especially at $15.

All in all, the food is mediocre, the staff is nice, the timing is SLOW, but great vistas while you dine."
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,We had our work holiday luncheon here. The staff did a good job of hustling and making sure food on the large buffet remained stocked and warm for about 85 people. They were also great about clearing the tables to ensure everyone could move on to dessert and holiday games. The food was pretty crowd pleasing and my only complaint was that the risotto was a bit undercooked and had a little crunch. Great view from the restaurant.
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,negative,"Humm, I wonder why this place doesn't have more reviews. The view is absolutely gorgeous and serene. I came here for lunch and got the Santa Fe Chicken Croissant sandwich. It was pretty good. Service was so-so. 

I would only come back to show out-of-town guests the view."
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,negative,"Hmm...

Well, I came here for lunch the other day and am Luke warm on the place. The view of the golf course and pond are nice, but less than inspiring. The restaurant is essentially the golf course bar, patio and a banquet room.

I went with my standard lunch salad order of a Cobb. There was nothing really special about the salad. The lettuce was ice berg, the cheese felt like it was sliced from a store bought brick, the meats felt processed...

I mean, this certainly wasn't the worst Cobb I have ever had but it was pedestrian, at best."
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,negative,"To say that this place has gone downhill is an understatement. I was horrified on a recent visit to find this place in a terrible state, in both dining area and food quality. 

First, let me just say that when a place starts to have a certain odor, it's time to either remodel or maybe (this is just crazy) clean the carpets?

Despite being one of only three tables (we arrived between breakfast and lunchtime so it was quiet) occupied, our tablecloth was dirty and there was a small, curly hair on the table. If I had unlimited space on Yelp, I'd express my horror in every language in which ""EWWWW"" is translatable.  I can't do that, so let's just say that if I hadn't been invited by other people to dine here, I'd have walked out at this point. 

The Servicemaster ad continued when I noticed the wall and window ledge next to me where   splattered with all manner of different colored foods. Maybe someone is a Pollock fan? I am amazed that none ONE PERSON who has worked here in the past decade has taken the initiative to wipe old food stains off the walls. That almost surpasses apathy and moves into dedication. 

Not wanting to look anywhere near me, I turned my gaze up. Only to find that the skylight was covered in a horrific display of cobwebs. I don't think it's ever been dusted up there. Not that I'd want it to be at this point, I can't imagine all of that junk being dislodged into the dining room. 

As far as the food, well....I ordered fish tacos supposedly battered in panko. It was definitely not panko and when you are into your second taco wondering if that really is chicken rather than fish? Well, lets just say you aren't eating the advertised fresh halibut, thats for sure. Don't get me started on how cold flour tortillas are not fish taco material. My tortilla soup tasted like the inside of a freezer. All of this for $15. 

The only plus was that the service was attentive and extremely friendly and the view is lovely, both of which are apparently the only things this place has going for it. 

Bottom line: If you like hairs of unknown origin on your table and food drippings in the foreground of your view, this is the place for you. If you don't like that kind of thing, and you prefer a clean dining room, consider eating elsewhere."
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,Love the view and the Chipotle ranch dip for French fries!! The turkey club on a croissant is also tasty. Mainly come here for the beautiful views and outdoor seating.
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,"Excellent lunch spot in Santa Barbara with an awesome view. I had the soup and ahi salad which is delicious! Great service and dining outdoors on the patio has a great view of the ocean. 

Warning though, there are 2 patios and one is behind a green. If you choose to dine there, you'll see the golf action, but you may way to wear a helmet!"
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,I enjoyed a great view and delicious food at their Thanksgiving buffet.  truly a hidden gem in Goleta!
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,"Came here with some colleagues for a celebratory lunch. I really enjoyed the beautiful patio with views of the golf course. The food took a bit longer to come out than expected but we had a party of 8 so I can understand that it's difficult to time everything right. Everyone was really happy with their food. The entrees come with a choice of salad or fries and all of us tried the fries which were the highlight.  The ahi wrap was tasty and fresh. Great dining experience, scenic spot to bring out of town guests."
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,positive,"This is a great place with an excellent panoramic view of western Goleta.

Having grown up in a home where Frog Bar & Grill was the view from our front yard, I've surprisingly only patronized this locale a handful of times. I know that their beverages and fare aren't too costly (in comparison to the typical golf course/view restaurant in town), and the vibe is pretty casual.

The venue itself is ideal for weddings and other familial or corporate events, with an adjoining party room and a prime Goleta view. We used this venue for my grandmother's memorial service, and the day couldn't have gone better. The staff were friendly and the Hors d'Oeuvres were top-notch. The place was clean and parking was plentiful. 

I will certainly be back!"
fnGZspqyamRremXor0sAyg,Frog Bar & Grill,American,negative,"Came for a late lunch and was hoping to get flat iron steak, but the kitchen was closed by the time I got there. No worries, I asked if the wings were fried and was told they were, and are delicious, so I ordered them.  When they came out, they appear to be baked or microwaved because it didnt have any crunch to it at all, and the wings were in the smaller side. My friend ordered the Reuben sammy and said it was just ok. To me it looked like a grilled cheese sammy with barely any meat inside. I've been here plenty of times (mainly for golf, in which the links are great) but maybe today, was not a good day for the kitchen. The scenery is nice, and seating outside has a good view of the course and pond. I will be back, and still want to try the flat iron steak."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I am from Colorado and am visiting Santa Barbara and let me tell you... what a great place to eat. The food was quality, but the customer service was even better. Also, I thought the price was really good for the amount of food you get. Food came out fast as well. Overall, I'd say it's a great breakfast place if you are in Santa Barbara"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I love their eggs! Their eggs taste better than any other restaurant eggs I've ever had. We always get the hash. Dawn Patrol is always super generous with the food portioning...with the hash, that is. My brother got a burger to go, and all it was was a piece of meat between two buns. However, he said the burger was really good, but still, I feel that they could've melted some cheese on top of the patty. All of their pastries, bread and jellies are homemade - and really delicious!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I think Dawn Patrol could become 4 stars but not just yet for me. I like the idea of make your own hash but the components need work. The corned beef was soggy when it should have been crispy. The over easy eggs were closer to medium. The potatoes, spinach and mushrooms were fine as was the cheddar. The accompanying salad was not as fresh as it could have been. Lastly for $13 in a casual order at the counter place, the portions were small.

The space itself is wonderful with a number of seating options indoors and out. Everything is neat and attractive and well laid out. 

Service is pleasant and competent.

Parking across the street in city lot."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"This place was good food, overpriced for the type of service you get and it was hot inside the restaurant"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Excellent place for a quick and casual breakfast. Delicious French toast. There are a lot of options on the menu. We also enjoyed the generous potion of fruit. Highly recommend if you have kids.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Food was great, service was not. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt it was an anomaly but it wasn't  busy and no one was very friendly and my order was wrong. Having said that, the coffee was great and the hash was really good--fresh, tasty, and nice portion."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Don't eat here unless you like hash, otherwise the options are really limited. I got the egg white frittata which was super average. Their vanilla bean latte was very good."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We wanted breakfast at 10:30 am on a Friday, so we used Yelp and went to this place.  It was exactly what we wanted.  We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the weather while eating our food.  The Make your Own Hash was so good, I practically licked my plate clean.  I also tried the wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam.  It was tasty.  I wish I could take a jar home with me.  We might even return tomorrow for breakfast again.  The only reason I could not give them 5 stars was the service.  It wasn't bad, just nothing impressive."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Absolutely amazing breakfast. I left feeling full but not weighted down with crappy food. Jordan was waiting the tables and OMG, the guy is on it and super friendly. This place comes highly recommended."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I had the traditional breakfast (two eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit) and split the french toast with friends. It was good. I have to say my favorite part was their English Breakfast Tea made with a french press and fresh honey. Delicious. It's slightly on the pricey side but you are in Santa Barbara in the touristy section."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Fresh food and creative dishes. The service was good and the seating was comfortable. The orange juice is awesome. I was very pleased with the made to order hash.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Had the patrol combo with a fresh squeezed orange juice and loved it! Cage free eggs were cooked well. Sausages were very high quality and not fatty. Even the jam that came with the toast was pretty good. It tasted natural, not too sweet with actual fruit preserves in it!

The luau french toast , made on hawaiian bread was pretty good too.

The only downside is that the wait for the food itself is a bit longer ,but nothing unreasonable. I think it took about 15 to 20 minutes for the food to come out. As long as you have some time to spare , I would recommend giving this place a try. Ingredients are healthy and fresh. 

There is parking right across from the restaurant."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great breakfast place - got the Benedict and substituted out the bacon for avocado. Flavor was on point. Will Probably swapped out toast for English muffin.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We've been here a couple times for their build your own hash! I ordered the salmon hash last time with poached eggs and hollandaise. It was sooo good! Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is pricing. $14-$16 for the hash and it's not full service dining.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Obsessed. I was in SB for my wedding and we randomly stumbled upon Dawn Patrol. I got the hash with yukon potatoes, chicken, egg whites, veggies, and hollandaise sauce, in addition to an iced coffee. It was hearty, fresh, and healthy, which is exactly what I was looking for. I loved it so much that I brought my new husband there the morning after our wedding. If I lived in SB, I'd be a regular."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Went up for a birthday weekend and it was grwat. Food portions were up to bar with the price. We decided to go with the famous build your own Hash breakfast item. We were not disappointed. Outside seating area was great. Highly recommend
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"We ate here on a Saturday morning at 8:30am. About 4 tables were occupied. 6 were in our party and no line to place our order. We felt the cost was excessive for what we received. $11 for 2 poached eggs, 2 small over cooked hard sage sausages, a scoop of sweet potato hash and a scone. I gave the scone an extra star. We sat at the big table in the corner which was nice. Thank heavens we didn't get drinks for everyone, we would have been over $100 for breakfast - crazy expensive. The bathroom was nothing special as stated in their advertisement. The black toilet was weird. You can't tell if someone left a load or not in there. Yuck. 

Everyone walked away saying the portions were small and nothing special for the price. We will not return."

MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Went on a weekend getaway to Santa Barbara and came here for breakfast.  The food was great and the price was decent.

MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Just had breakfast here this morning. Great place, friendly people, cool decor. Had the Build a hash, kinda their signature thing. Very hearty and tasty. Not really a breakfast guy but this hit the spot, could eat it any time of day. They have quite a few lunchy things on the menu too, like sandwiches and salads, have to come back and check those out."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The Eggs benny were slamming and the state st salad was supper.  Will be going back again
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Really enjoyed breakfast here. Great food and coffee, with healthy options. I enjoyed the egg-white fritata with seeded avocado and berries. Yum. Very friendly and attentive staff. Indoor and outdoor seating. Cool vibe. Free WiFi."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Want to have one of the most delicious breakfast burritos you'll ever have? Try Dawn Patrol's, with avocado and Oaxaca cheese!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great Food!  I like their gluten free and vegetarian options and that they have an outdoor patio area you can sit with your dog.  My only complaint is that they have really SLOW service.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great breakfast spot with lots of healthy choices. The hash options allow you to pick base (potatoes or sweet potatoes) a plethora of veggies,eggs any style and sauce of choice. I had huevos rancheros and husband had the hash. Huevos were perfect, sauce was perfect and black beans were perfect. Coffee was weird and bitter but that seemed to be true of many places in Santa Barbara. I just prefer a smoother, less bitter brew. Arrived before 9 on a Saturday and service was great. Got busy by 9 with a line to order and most of the tables full. Great, clean food!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fun place. Good food. 

I had the eggs Benedict which is not on their menu board but they do make it. It's excellent. 

The hash with salmon is also good. 

They also have sandwiches and burgers."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"My daughter recommended we go here and after sitting there for a few minutes I figured out why.  There are 3 gyms in the area including a rock climbing gym.  Let's just say, she was busy and distracted.  But hey, at least she wasn't on her phone.

One of my biggest pet peeves is not being able to park.  There is a nice big parking lot across the street that is free for the first 75 minutes.

You must order at a counter, which isn't bad, I suppose, but the prices reflect someone to serve you. They let you pick out your own emoji table marker so they know where to bring the food.  I thought that was kind of fun, a new way to express yourself at a breakfast joint.

I totally missed the build your own hash, not sure how, it is front and center. I think it is trying to choose something reading off a big sign as you approach the counter. I was only looking under the board entitled breakfast. Not good under pressure maybe???  

I ordered a very simple breakfast called The Patrol Combo; 2 eggs, bacon, garlic roasted potatoes.  They only had one type of bread, sour dough, which I thought was strange.  It wasn't even 10 am on a Thursday.
I read on another review they were out of bread, so common theme? 

All in all, it was very standard.  One thing I noted is the bacon looked way too crispy, over cooked, but it really wasn't.  It was really good.  Another, is the attention to detail, like adding the chives for decoration on the eggs.  I thought that was a nice touch.

My daughter had the eggs Benedict which she finished before I really even saw it.  She said it was good.

I would like to go back and try the build your own hash.  I think that is where the 5 stars lie. I would also recommend going on a weekday so you don't have to wait in a long line."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The food here is so good, I had the gluten free pancakes and they were so amazing they didn't even taste gluten free! I like the atmosphere of the place it's very progressive and unique as well. I will definitely eat here again!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Nice easy breakfast with good sized portions. Delicious iced tea. The order first then sit and wait style makes it easy going and the wait for the home cooked food wasn't long. Despite their featured hash name the potatoes are roasted and not hashed. Still tasted good but was hoping it was hashed
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Dawn Patrol is one of our favorite breakfast spots in SB! We come every time we visit-their build your own hash is delicious and the coffee is solid. Everything is fresh and tasty.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great experience.  Although I'm on the record of not being a big fan of ""counter service"" (order at counter and find a place to sit on your own), it works for this casual breakfast place.  We went on a weekday about 10am and had many places to sit.  Tea is brought out in a French press which is cool and the well-steeped tea is great.  My build-your-own-hash was delicious and my friend raved about their ""Prisoner Muffin"" (which is an egg within a cornbread style muffin).  Service was excellent and friendly.  A must-go breakfast place in the main part of Downtown Santa Barbara."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I had super high hopes for this place. Would probably give a 3.5 star rating. Line was super long, but the food cane pretty quickly once ordered. The food was kind of dry and the flavors just didn't quite pop for me. The prices are decent so I wouldn't protest going there again to try something else, but probably not during rush hour."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Bustling casual brunch spot on the touristy strip of State Street with solidly good food. Their menu includes a make-your-own hash option -a good differentiating element in the sea of typical brunch fare. We would definitely go back.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Was here a few weeks ago. Now I wish there was one in Huntington Beach! Love the food, decor and atmosphere. Would definitely go back!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Got a coffee to go at dawn patrol which was pretty good. Only thing is that it was boiling hot when I picked it up! Had to wait a good 15 minutes before I could drink it. Apart from that the place was nice and the staff very friendly.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent spot.  Great food, great coffee, super nice people, State Street by the beach.  What's not to love.  Check these folks out if you are in SB for work, school, or fun."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"What a find! I ordered the create your own hash and the eggs were cooked to perfection, the veggie sausage was so tasty! and the toast was home from scratch (unlike most breakfast/brunch joints)! This is truly a unique and tasty place to stop for breakfast/brunch with a relaxed environment and friendly staff. Cannot wait to come back!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Stopped in for breakfast and so glad we did. Delicious food and great service. Got the hash. Definitely try the sage sausage.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,expect to wait a while when coming here on the weekends. our breakfast was delicious  and the staff were super friendly.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Loved this breakfast place.  Day two of our vacation and my daughter is still talking about the bacon.  I had the french toast, daughter had the hash.  The variety of choice in the hash was the best, especially being able to use sweet potato.  Very clean and organized.  Loved the outdoor seating.  Suggest you get in early on weekends.  The line was long when we were leaving just before leaving."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I wish I had found this place earlier and definitely plan on coming back! 

I had the French toast and fresh orange juice- while the French toast was pretty much like any other French toast, the lemon butter that comes with it was amazing and the fruit that came with it was quite fresh! The orange juice is pretty pricey at $5 but worth every penny- it's sweet, fresh, and pulp free!

Service was good, organized and timely! Everyone was kind and there was no confusion of where to order or how to get seated and stuff!

I like the overall laid back, friendly atmosphere and will recommend dawn patrol to anyone!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is delicious! My only complain is that they take an extremely long time to take orders, so don't go hungry. The food is really fresh and has a great variety for breakfast."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Cute place. Huevos Rancheros were prepared well, although it seems a bit overpriced at $12 a plate. I almost feel like I can walk to the 99 cent store down the street and buy a can of beans/bag of tostadas to make it myself. 

I did enjoy the salsas though; they all tasted very bright and fresh.

The Coffee Cake is fine, but a bit dry after I asked them to re-heat it. I probably wouldn't ask them to re-heat it again.

They don't use numbers for your orders; they use emojis. So you'll have waiters come up to your table and ask ""Are you unicorn/moustache face/batman?"" It's a little absurd; it almost feels like it should be a joke on Parks and Rec that parodies millennial culture.

But it's still a cute place to get brunch."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,I was looking for a delicious and filling Breakfast and this place was amazing the build your own Hash was on point wish we had one of these in LA
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Nice breakfast spot where you can make your own hash! Our toast didn't come buttered, so you have to ask for butter or jam for your toast. We choose sausage, corn, spinach, pepper jack cheese, sweet potato and poached eggs with herb aioli. I didn't really taste the herb aioli, and regretted not getting the hollandaise. The place was cute, and relatively fast and some of the other food look really good, but our hash was just okay."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This was a great breakfast place. We see places come and go all the time. But this one looks like it is Here to stay. Staff was beyond friendly . I loved everything about this place . Jordan and Angela really made the entire breakfast worthwhile.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Small place tucked away on lower state.  I really like the order first then sit down aspect.  We had the French toast and the Chorizo Hash Special.  You can't really go wrong with French toast.  The chorizo hash was disappointing and not an ""off the chart"" breakfast choice.  The coffee was just ok.  I probably need to try another menu item before abandoning this option."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"On our early-morning drive up the coast from Orange County to Monterey, we decided to stop at Dawn Patrol in Santa Barbara for breakfast.  What can I say?  The two build-your-own hashes we ordered were both fantastic.  Loved the homemade jam that came with the toast.  It's not possible to choose what's best, as the number of combinations and permutations is...well, you do the math.  We enjoyed great service and the surfer look.  Plus the delicious scone we brought to eat in the car later on.  If Dawn Patrol ever comes up to Marin County where we live, we'll be first in line!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Had one of best burgers in a while here the other day. Very original recipe, with baby kale, tomato jam, and a spicy aioli, and cooked perfectly. Today I tried a half order of French toast, to great satisfaction. Fresh fruit, lemon-whipped butter, and quality maple syrup, all on top of house-made Hawaiian bread. 

The rest of the menu looks fantastic as well. Prices are about average, but still a good deal, considering the quality. They also have a couple of items available in small or large portions."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"A casual brunch spot between downtown and the wharf. You order at the counter, grab an emoji, and they bring your food to the table. We went for the build your own hash. They had some good options and our hash was really yummy. It had sweet potatoes, sage sausage, lots of veggies and topped with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. It's also served with toast and a small green salad. I think it was around $14."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Pros: new presentation 

Cons:
Limited menu
Ordinary food, certainly not 4-star 
Small portions (considering price)

They came up first on my Yelp search. In hindsight, it might be better to go for others. Probably explore a bit more"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,You select your ingredients to do your own hash for breakfast..great idea and the coffee is very pleasant.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great breakfast place! Highly recommend if you are visiting town. Order the build your own hash!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,One of the best meals I've had in California. The build your own hash was delicious. Friendly and fast service. The best part was the meal which was delicious. Every part of the meal was awesome down to the side salad and toast. Highly recommend!!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"My husband and I were visiting Santa Barbara for our baby moon and had great meals the whole time we were here and decided to try Dawn Patrol for the great reviews. The ambience is super cool and chill and the menu looked good. I got the patrol combo, scrambled eggs with sausage and added a pancake while my husband got the breakfast burrito. The food was ok, my scrambled eggs were more like an omelette with no flavor, sausage had no flavor either and the garlic potatoes tasted a day old. The only good thing for me was the pancake and the fresh squeezed oj. My husband enjoyed his burrito but it was small compared to the price. I really wanted to like this place but if we visit SB again we won't be coming here."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fresh food and well-prepared, good portion size. Very casual atmosphere, service was fine but not overly friendly. Nice variety on the menu. Coffee is solid and the mimosa was tasty. Location is great with indoor and outdoor seating. Would definitely return when we're in the area."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Busy place.  I was disappointed since the reviews were so high I thought it under delivered.  

We came in on a Friday morning around 10am.  I had the French toast and it came out cold. The syrup was cold also, but I ate everything.   The fruit was yummy but I was surprised they would cut up and serve unripe cantaloupe. I ordered a cup of drip coffee and the coffee was excellent.  Serve your self water, it was unfiltered and tasted nasty.

After we place our order and paid and tipped....we were told food will take 25 to 30 minutes to receive.  This would have been nice to know prior to ordering.

My son had the build your own potato with gravy and my husband had same with salsa.  They  both seem to enjoy it but both mentioned they didn't have enough potato?

One star for coffee and one star for the good location. Bathroom was dirty."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Dawn Patrol is a first-class hash joint!  Chose your own hash!  You pick from the list of possible ingredients and the results are magical!  Yum!!  A must try when in Santa Barbara!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We tried the egg white frittata it was delicious...it comes with an avocado that's dipped in pumpkin seeds and chia seeds and with a side of fresh berries!

The corned beef hash was the best we have ever tried! I am not sure how they make it but it is incredible!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Build a hash and a small order of GF pancakes. Hash had a delicious blend of sweet and savory pancakes were good as well. The true star the coffee not too strong not too weak,  perfect!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great food. The build your own hash was great. The coffee was great. The blueberry coffee cake was fantastic. My only issue is the line. For a Sunday morning, around 10:30AM, from start of the wait in line to actually receiving the food, 45 minutes. If you are hungover, probably not the spot due to the line. If you have the patience, its worth it."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great place to have breakfast! Enjoyed the seeded avocado on my plate with the frittata. Nice big cups of coffee. Great selection of food items. Can't wait to go back again.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Food was delicious and fresh! We had The Patrol combo plate with a fluffy pancake and the Build-a-Hash plate that was so yummy! Can't forget the fresh squeezed orange juice! Definitely a great brunch spot.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Dong Patrol is great!  Big fan!  So many quality dongs to chose from.  Highly recommend for any and all dong lovers.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This is the best breakfast I've had! The build your own hash is the best with so many options for all taste buds. If you're in Santa Barbara you must try this place! Service is great! Very dedicated to having your experience here worth the buck!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,My friends and I came in around noon and ordered the build your own hash. It was one of the greatest dishes I've had on my life. The atmosphere was relaxing and the choice of music was a good pair. When I come up to visit SB more often I'll have to stop at this joint for breakfast more than half of my stay.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"split an egg and hash brown dish(homefries were amazing) and the scone we got was amazing too although a little on the pricier side, the freshly baked raspberry scone couldn't be beat. also, the coffee and juices are fresh and delish just made for a delicious but kind of expensive bfast. wouldn't crave it or go back again if it wasn't on my way elsewhere."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Good quality breakfast and reasonable prices.  Do to location the parking can be tough and during weekend the lines can be long.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Everything was delicious. I got build your hash, love that it comes with a side salad. Great atmosphere and cute decor."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Ordered the French Toast and Eggs Benedict along with a cappuccino and regular coffee. The french toast was a bit dry and the Eggs Benedict was nothing to write home about (came on regular toast rather than english muffin). Overall the food was ok, but I don't think I would go back.  Pretty much just ""meh, I've experienced better""."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I love this place. The food and coffee are excellent. On the weekends, expect a bit of a line but as a local, It's great and I would highly recommend their ""Build your own"" hashes."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Delicious and healthy breakfast, friendly staff, clean and welcoming. Highly recommend !!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Very hard to see the sign off the street. Once you are in the restaurant, you order at the front counter and you get an object with a silly photo on it - ours was an over-easy egg photo attached to a figure of a dancing hawaiian girl. You can choose your own seat, so we sat outside. It is always lovely to sit outside in Santa Barbara. Here, you are right on State Street across from the walkway where the Montecito bridge is just the next street above you. The vibrance of the activity of people walking, biking, and skating along the streets is rejuvenating. The food arrives quickly and nicely plated. I ordered the marinated salmon which comes with very thick rye nutty bread. The bread was delicious and the salmon was amazing. However, I couldn't finish the last two pieces of my salmon, even though I am a salt-aholic, I found it surprisingly salty. Portions were generous and the food was of high quality. I would definitely come again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So glad we tried Dawn Patrol for an early breakfast. I came to SB with my sister to visit my daughter... this was a great start to our day. Friendly greeting as we entered, and prompt service. We ordered at the counter then experienced attentive staff after we took a seat at a table of our choice. Cool, current beachy decor. All our food was delicious (between the three of us we had the Build a Hash, 3 Egg White Frittata, and the House Cured Salmon, each having the fresh squeezed orange juice, too). I cannot wait to return when I get a chance to come to SB again... I wish we had something like this where I live.

Location is tucked away so it takes a bit to find if you are not familiar with the area, but we had the address so we knew where to look."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is by far my favorite spot for breakfast in Santa Barbara. 

Super convenient, friendly staff, great atmosphere, and even better food. All of the build-a-hash's are great, but their Chorizo Hash Special is honestly the best breakfast I have ever had. Coupled with a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ and a cup of coffee is as close to perfect as I have found. 

Could not recommend enough."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Came here with my cousin while in town and I seriously could not have been more impressed. I ordered the seared tuna sandwich, just because I like to try new things and what a surprise it was! The kimchi on the sandwich was so tasty. Honestly, it tasted more like candy then kimchi. The side salad that came with it was also awesome. I will definitely be back and will recommend this place to future guest."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I have been having brunch here about twice a month for the past two years. Their build a hash is AMAZING. Get it with sweet potatoes, poached eggs and sage sausage. If I could only eat one meal for the rest of my life that would be it. Staff are friendly, the place is clean, and it can be 
 busy on the weekends. 10/10 recommend."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I did not dine in, so this review is for the food only. 
I got a small serving of the Hawaiian bread French toast and the prisoner egg. 

The French toast came soggy, because they already add the syrup. If you're calling in, definitely ask for it on the side. I can only imagine how much more delicious it would be if it weren't bogged down with syrup. 

I had high hopes for the prisoner egg dish. 
The muffin is nice if not a bit dry. The egg was overcooked. But I still really liked the idea of it and I would order again just to see if it could taste any different. 

Parking can be a pain on the weekends. You may find yourself circling the blocks several times on the lookout for a 15 mins green spot. Good luck !"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Dawn Patrol is a pretty average brunch spot with higher than average prices. I chose to build my own hash because I noticed that you can do so with sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes. I asked that my sweet potatoes, peppers, and onions be tossed with sage sausage, mushrooms, spinach, and tomatoes and topped with poached eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly; though I had requested hollandaise sauce on the side, I ended up smothering my hash with the runny yolks. My dad ordered the patrol combo and some oolong green tea. He was satisfied with his food but didn't end up drinking his tea because it over-steeped and tasted very bitter. My biggest complaint is that the traffic picked up around 11am and made it difficult to have a conversation or hear the music on the patio. Try to go before then for a quieter, more enjoyable meal."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The freshest corn beef I ever had. Perfect end to a great weekend 
Delicious, fresh food. I highly recommend 
Great coffee and I like their water carafes
Tucked away but not too hard to find"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The best hash I've EVER had! Definitely get the veggie sausage! You'd never know they weren't made out of actual sausage.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Coconut milk latte is amazing.  Bring your own mug to join the""Mug Club.  Build your own hash with sweet potatoes and get the gluten free pancakes to share.  The staff is so friendly and everything is sourced local, fresh, and organic!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I went there for the first time on Saturday for brunch; I wasn't sure what to expect.

I tried the hash for the first time. I got it with sweet potatoes, all the veggies, salmon and topped with scrambled eggs. It was delicious! The only odd thing was the salad that came with it had NO DRESSING. I am not a girl who wastes food but it was just weird to have lettuce just chillin' next to the hash. Next time I'll just tell them to save it.

I also got a mimosa which was in the tiniest glass that I have ever seen... not doing that again.

I will probably go there again but it will not be my first choice place for brunch."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Really good and fresh food. Nice service, but very  slow. No GF bread but they gave us a yummy GF pancake instead."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent breakfast spot. It is literally around the corner from our house. I will be back jacky. Breakfast sandwich was my choice for this day. My dad had B&E and he liked it. I want to try the burger next time. Btw , breakfast is not the most important meal of the day.... That's a myth!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Their ""make your own hash"" is worth the long line. Quality ingredients, hearty food, healthy + vegetarian options."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Terrific food!! I ordered the sweet potato hash with peppers and onions, bacon, spinach, cheddar, eggs and hollandaise. So so good!! Also had fresh squeezed orange juice. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food. Everything was very fresh and flavorful."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is my new favorite breakfast spot in SB. Good food, good service, and good coffee. Go early because the crowds assemble and lines lengthen by 10am. Unfortunately, the service does slack off as the numbers grow. There's only one cashier who takes orders, so the line is often out to the sidewalk. They must like it that way, but several people walk away after the wait. The staff, food and experience is much better early!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Loved the food and the ambience.  You order at the front, and then they bring you the food.  You get your own entire bottle of water for the table.  We tried it based on the reviews and they did not lead us wrong!!  People were very friendly.  I will travel far for good service and good food and I will definitely come back here."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Been here for breakfast and lunch. The huevos rancheros are delicious!!! My husband likes the ""build you hash"" combo. Their salads are also really delicious. Please open a Dawn Patrol in Carp :)"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is so great! They have amazingly tasty breakfast/brunch options, especially the ""build your own hash"" options. They have a nice outdoor seating area that's dog friendly. Nice selection of pastries too."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Safe to say this place deserved to be my first help review. I'm way out of town and came to Santa Barbara to see a musician later that day. Was looking for a good breakfast spot and easily fell in love. From living somewhere that doesn't have quality healthy options this was perfect. Staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very 'kickback'. I would come back here again when I'm ever in Santa Barbara again. 
PS, coffee is amazing. BYOH was worth it."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Ordered the hash w/ chicken and over easy eggs... at first I was a little skeptical of the price but it was delicious and filling!!! Totally reccomend for brunch. Yummy
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great coffee (I want to figure out where they get theirs!). Delicious food. Great service. Everything tasted fresh and perfectly cooked.  We went on a Saturday - arrive before 8:45am to avoid longer lines.

I had the hash special (chorizo) and my wife had the 3 egg white frittata. We also shared a small French Toast order!

You get a very large cup with your coffee, so refills aren't free - though they're only 75 cents, and the server voluntarily offered to comp ours.  We took our refill in a to-go cup."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"First time here.  Wow.  We both ordered the build your own hash.  I licked the plate clean.  Healthy portions, great friendly service. Jordan hooked it up.  Possibly the coolest bathrooms I've ever seen.   Our new spot for sure."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great spot to enjoy the morning sun and your coffee. Order and pay on the counter then pick an emoji for them to bring your order later. Outdoor seating available. Great ambiance.
Fresh ingredients,great portions!
Love the hash!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Fantastic place and worth the long wait line to get in.  Not your normal affair which I like
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great low key breakfast spot. Unpretentious with unique hash combos, outdoor seating and friendly staff."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Went here last weekend on a little overnight trip to Santa Barbara... Cool location with a nice atmosphere.  My GF had some watermelon poke salad that looked pretty blah and apparently tasted just as disappointing.  I had a hash with country gravy and it was freaking amazing good!   Def the place to go for breakfast food!  However, be careful if you order an orange juice.  $8 fawkin dollars!  I was baffled when I saw that!!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Best breakfast!  We love this place.  Healthy but so yummy.  We've only been here for breakfast but I'm sure their entire menu is great.  Coffee is high quality too.  We love the oatmeal, pancakes, French toast, huevos ramcheros, eggs Benedict, fresh oj, scones...basically everything.  Owner is great.  Location is convenient if you're staying st the beach.  Decor is hip and colorful.  Staff is great.  I don't have anything negative to say other than I wish I lived here so I could eat here weekly.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Love stopping here for breakfast when traveling up the coast. Great gluten-free pancakes !
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I haven't had breakfast this good in a while. I chose the build a hash with russet potatoes, sage sausage, corn, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, spinach, poached eggs, and herb aioli. Nothing was over powering, flavors were just right. 

My fiancé and I came on a Wednesday morning and it was not too busy. Service here is excellent to say the least. They took time to make suggestions while explaining in detail what was going into their meals. 

It is seat yourself so I imagine when it's busy, it might get hectic but the place is big enough to seat a large amount of people with a patio outside and plenty of seats inside with booths."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Awesome place to have a coffee and breakfast while I do my morning work! Dawn Patrol has reliable internet spacious booths a really nice outdoor patio and a very friendly staff. My recommendation for breakfast is the breakfast burrito, which is stuffed with fried eggs, whole black beans, cheese and avocado served with yummy salsa and they don't skimp on the avocado!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We parked at the Amtrak station and walked up State St. checking Yelp and the other reviewers rated it highly. Great breakfast, fast service, breakfast selections is fairly simple and what they do they do very well. Our order was brought out to the patio and our server checked to make sure we had everything we needed, and then returned a second time to check if we were satisfied. Not a fancy place, just good food."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I used yelp to find this place, we drove from Oxnard it was totally worth the drive!!! Everything we got here was AMAZING from coffee to the jelly! Do yourself a favor and eat here."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"This place is not that good, not a great price, and the service is nether fast nor very friendly. You have lots of better, cheaper, and/or nicer options in this town.

The online menu sounds nice enough, but when you get there, you may find that some of the better-sounding items aren't actually on the menu in the restaurant and are not being offered. My partner and I both picked from the build-your-own-hash options (great idea!), but when our food finally showed up, both plates were plain, low on flavor, and *tiny*. When was the last time you left a breakfast joint thinking you could use more food? Yeah, me neither. I've bought $5 breakfast burritos that were more filling and flavorful. Dawn Patrol is maybe a good option if you're frantically counting calories, but somehow still going out for hash browns?

The servers were rarely seen and took their sweet time with stuff like finding us some silverware after our food had already arrived. The coffee was really expensive for a breakfast joint, not very good, and didn't come with refills (or maybe the service was just lacking on that end, too). I like the Dawn Patrol concept in theory, but I'm not going back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I was in town last weekend and decided to come here due to the great rating and reviews. My friends and I decided to toughen up and wait in line to order our food. We ended up waiting over 30 minutes to order, but after our great meal, we were not upset about the long wait. I ordered the build your own hash which consisted of sweet potatoes, veggie sausage, a variety of veggies, scrambled eggs and topped it with salsa and avocado. The hash came with a side of salad and toast. You must try their homemade jelly, it's to die for!! I'm not a jelly person but this jelly is a must! I look forward to coming here on my next trip to Santa Barbara!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Came down here to SB over the 4th of July weekend. We wanted some bomb breakfast so we search on yelp and found this yummy gem. 

At first we got lost and went around the restaurant. But it was literally right next to Casa Blanca! Just keep walking up passing Casa Blanca and you will see it. I believe it's street parking only or if you want to pay for parking at the lots. There was plenty of street parking on a Tuesday. 

When you first walk in, its order first, then you go grab a seat inside the restaurant or outside their patio. A hip place playing some awesome music. The prices are average and don't complain about it because it tastes so fresh! The food is really good!

We were looking at pictures of yelp of what other yelpers got and decided on the built your own hash. It was so bomb!!! We got sweet potatoes with sage sausage, spinach, tomatoes, mushroom and cheddar cheese. I like my eggs a little runny so I chose over easy eggs with the hollandaise sauce on top. It was so flavorful in every bite! The egg yolk mixed in with the sausage and vegetables and that oooey gooey cheese! BOMB! Comes with a side of salad and choice of toast. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!

We decided to order a salty and sweet. So this dish was like a dessert plate. We choose French Toast. Small portion that comes with 3 slices. The other option was 5 slices I believe. But this was enough to share between the 2 of us without being over stuffed. Comes with fruits which were pretty sweet and not sour. They didn't have much variety of sweet dishes. It was either french toast or pancakes. 

Overall, great experience and good food! Great service and very helpful! They bring your food pretty fast toO!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I'm not even sure I can handle how delicious this food is. I did the build your own has, and it was amazing. Sweet potato, corned beef, corn, mushrooms and spinach with a side of salsa? It was amazing, literally one of the best hashes I've had in my life. Also, they ask you if you want jam or butter with your toast, but what they fail to tell you is they make their own jam! It's strawberry jam with chunks of strawberry in it, and it's really really good. So pop in, order some food at the counter, grab your emoji holder and eat out on the patio. A wonderful little spot for a delicious breakfast."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The wifey and I went for breakfast this morning. I got the sweet potato hash  with sausage and sunny side eggs . Their jam that comes with the toast is amazing!!! Definitely have to come here if your thinking about it and checking out reviews.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Very, very, very, long line and very, very, long wait. Worth the wait? Yes. The food was exceptional, fresh, and hot. Great service, but boy were they slammed on a Sunday. Sweet potato with corn beef hash, spinach, tomatoes, and side salad---DELICIOUS."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great food, freshly prepared.  The build your own hash was the right amount of ingredients I chose.  Fresh squeezed Orange Juice and a friendly staff make this a great place for breakfast on State Street."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Amazing scone, reheated to perfection, and delightful place with a super chilled vibe and great food. A great stop whether you are driving up / down the 101, recovering from a Bachelorette party or living here. Warmly recommended!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"First time there, stopped there for a morning breakfast and it was amazing food and great service"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Delicious breakfast! I recommend to build your own hash. Friendly service! Nice and casual atmosphere. I would go again.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Amazing service and egg white frittata with avocado. General manager does a great job making sure everyone was getting serviced as well as the staff on getting water and coffees to go. We will definitely be back and highly recommend making this place as the Santa Barbara breakfast spot.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The food looked great on line and my GF and I were very excited to try this place out after our morning run.  

Upon arrival we asked a few questions about the menu and placed our order. Breakfast for two was about $35.00 (this included a 20% tip).   

Our drinks came out and the ice tea I ordered was cloudy and tasted old.  I asked the server to exchange the poor quality tea for an orange juice.  

The server said he would, but that I had to pay the price difference of $5.00.  Really?  Maybe I should have just asked for my $3.00 back out of your register.

I paid the $5.00 difference and waited for my meal.  The food was good, but small in quantity. 

I get the impression this place has money problems because I saw staff nickel and diming other patrons as well.  

Poor service, small quantities.... I'd skip this place."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The service was friendly, but it took over 35 mins to receive two breakfast plates on Sunday afternoon. I'd pass if I had the opportunity again-- too slow. For a walk-up counter, you shouldn't have to wait 35 mins and pay $13 for one breakfast."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Yum....yum...yum...split the gluten free pancakes and egg white frittata. Fantastic food, cute cozy place, good coffee (and decaf)."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent food, solid breakfast staples and a nice take on healthy choices. They could put another cash register up front to move the line along, but otherwise friendly service."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Decent place for breakfast in SB. We all got the build-your-own-hash. I got mine with sweet potatoes, salmon, poached eggs, and the herb aioli. It was good but portion sizes were a bit small. For how expensive it adds up to be (mine was ~$20 total with tip), I would expect bigger portions, but it was pretty good. My friend got a pancake that we all tried and that was delicious (I'm not even a huge fan of pancakes, but this one was yum!!) You order at the register and grab your own water, but the staff is friendly and attentive. Definitely a solid choice in Santa Barbara but I wouldn't come here regularly!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Check out this enjoyable breakfast/brunch spot! Our food was excellent - the egg white frittata with sweet potatoes was terrific! My wife loved her vanilla latte. The wait staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. The patio is dog friendly, too."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Tried this great new spot and the food was good. Nice portion size, great gluten free options."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Hard to find! But so are most jewels! I hope it lasts. Downtown needed a place like this. I had the eggs Benedict and it was a great choice for the first time. Next I want to dive into the hash culture!
See you there!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Service was not friendly and the much talked-about Hash had no flavor-even after adding salt! Thought something was wrong with my taste buds...then tried a scone. It was simply the best I have ever had: moist, buttery, tart and with a crisp crust. I would probably return to give them another chance. They need an enthusiastic lady at the front counter to be more welcoming of guests."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Well, this location was previously known for the French Toast...  Now the new Damn Patrol is keeping the tradition going but with a new twist. Their Spicy French Toast is amazing!! All I can say is, JUST DO IT!!  I'll definitely be back!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Extremely friendly staff and delicious food!!! The Luau French Toast was our favorite. They were very accommodating to our family of four and I wish we could take this restaurant back to Texas with us!!!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Best, most healthful meal we had during our 2.5 day stay in SB. We walked there from the Hyatt Centric for breakfast. My wife, who just wanted a nourishing healthy breakfast had the veggie sandwich with humus cucumber on house made bread. She was very happy. I had the salmon hash and equally pleased. Great for vegetarians, vegans, or someone who just doesn't want run of the mill resort food."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The staff was wonderful !! Everyone was so friendly and attentive. Food was great, if you are looking for a quick bite I would definitely recommend it."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The place is very cute, and the food was ok, but could have been a little bit better considering the price point...

Suggestions:

Vegan Options. The veggie sausage option is not vegan. Its time to support all dietary restrictions, especially in SB.

More than one register.  Phone call orders were taking priority over the guests who came down and were standing in line.  Frustrating for those of us who were physically there. Line got big fast and could have been alleviated by having two registers.

Pricing.  Skillet is too costly especially for what you get and any add ons are stupid expensive making the skillet be like $16.50.  Also, should have some kind of side with the burritos..

Overall I liked it, and will go there again, just not my go-to place."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Absolutely amazing food. Super fresh, healthy and hits the spot. I got the Build your own Hash: sweet potatoes, bacon, spinach/mushroom/tomato, and poached eggs with side salad. The food was simple but delicious. New breakfast spot!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I found this on yelp and decided to give it a try. I thought 4.5 stars...it must be good. Breakfast was delicious! You build your breakfast: pick a starch, protein, veggies, egg style and voilà! I requested the sweet potatoes with grilled onions...yum!!! We got a short stack of gluten free pancakes and it was like having a desert!  We will certainly return!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Their hash was great. The best part i liked were the lightly poached eggs. The yolk were so silky and it mixed just perfect with hash, giving it smoothness. However the wait for the food to come out was long. It was definitely busy due to Sunday, i guess."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I ordered the build your own scramble to go, with Russet Potatoes, Spinach, House cured Salmon, Pepper Jack Cheese, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. It sounds delicious, but what I received left quite a bit to be desired. 

The potatoes were well cooked but lack any sort of seasoning, the spinach was non-existent (like, there was no spinach), the eggs over-poached to the point of having hard yolks (may have been because of the 5 minute trip from the restaurant to my work, but they would have had to have been overcooked in the first place to end up this hard), less cheese than you would find on a steak sandwich at a kosher deli, and, wait for it, a bland and flavorless country gravy in place of my hollandaise.

It's not that the food is inedible, but for the (lack of) quantity and flavor, $12.50 is a steep price to pay for something that will leave you disappointed through-out the morning.

I will say that my coworkers enjoyed the gluten free pancakes, buttermilk pancakes, and sides of bacon they ordered, and the service was friendly and excellent, but I will leave it to them to write their own reviews should they feel so inclined.

At the end of the day, there are many breakfast places nearby that offer comparable pricing with a much more generous dose of flavor. If you have to eat breakfast on State and Gutierrez, I would walk a block or two somewhere else first."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"These guys must be killin' it here on Yelp...but that's not hard to do if you know how to push social media buttons. The food is quite good, the prices are high, the stand-in-line-to-order-at-the-counter thing is ridiculous, as the guy taking the order refuses to make eye contact and with the insane noise level in the place, you don't know if he's actually heard you clearly or not.  The table water service is just plain weird...and it's lukewarm tap water anyway, so what's the point of the ""special bottle"" weirdness?  The coffee is excellent, the restroom decor is cool.  If you want to meet tourists (who are obviously sourcing the place through Yelp) and avoid bumping into locals, this is the place for you.  On the other hand, if you're a local...we miss the old place."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is amazing! Love the atmosphere and great customer service. I have a dairy allergy and they were really accommodating and helpful! Good prices for great, fresh food."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I used to come here when it was the Beach Break Cafe. We tried it recently now that it is Dawn Patrol. You order at the counter and they bring you the food. That's fine but I kind of miss the table service. Not a big deal though. Food was pretty good overall. I wish they had kept some of the basics, especially for the kids. They've got a Mini Patrol that has eggs, choice of meat and potatoes but I wish they still had kids options for combinations that include pancakes and/or french toast. You can get it added on the side, which we did. I didn't think the pancake was very good though. It was a little overcooked. I think we'll go back to give it another try but it's not super high on our list. The prices are pretty indicative of what you'll have to pay for downtown/State Street basic fare."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I was expecting great things from this place, but was slightly disappointed with a ""good but nothing special"" dish."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I write this review happy and full!! I had the build your own hash ($13) with sweet potatoes, all veggies, add avocado, and salsa. I love the build-your-own concept because it makes it easy for people to eat around animal-based foods. 

Great outdoor patio on which you can sip a mimosa. Centrally located. And they have music! 

Order at the counter then pick your own table."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"One of the best breakfast places I've ever been to!  Outstanding food, all very fresh and love the create your own hash concept...  In addition to the food the service, and atmosphere was perfect!Can't wait to come back tomorrow!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Came here for breakfast while traveling in the area. Extremely happy I did. The make your own hash was the best remedy to a long night at the bars. And Jordan who seemed to be the man in charge that day was amazingly friendly and attentive. Definitely made an impression. I'll be back for sure.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Went in on a Saturday morning around 10:30, figured it would be packed, but the line up to the counter where you order went quickly. And we got atable right away. I got the build your own hash, russets, onions, peppers, mushrooms, spinach, cheddar, (perfectly) poached eggs topped with hollandaise. The side salad was a little weird with breakfast but not unwelcome. My bae got the French toast and cleaned his plate, so it must have been fantastic. I will definitely return on my next trip to sb."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Friendly service. Fresh food. Atmosphere is cool. ( beach like decor Reggae music )  Little pricey, but great tasting food."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This was one of the best breakfasts I have EVER EATEN!
The staff opened the door early on a Saturday for me, and I waited until 7:30 until they began to serve food.  The ingredients were fresh, the egg white frittata was absolutely fantastic, coupled with fresh fruit and it was even better!
I only wish I could've tried more menu items, but I was really full, but not that oh-Lord-why-did-I-eat-that level, it was just right and kept me powered up for a busy day in SB.  Highly Recommend!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The only thing detracting from a five star rating was that 2/3 in my party (myself included) waited an hour for our food. Not sure if it was because we ordered separately but right after each other. We were warned about a 30 minute wait but that was not even close to the case. However once my food arrived it was thoroughly enjoyable. Build your own hash, you won't regret it. It's so good and so filling and completely customizable to all your favorite breakfast flavors."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Good but not memorable.  Bonus they make there hollandaise sauce from scratch.  This is a tough task for any place but they slightly messed it up.  Flavors good but I think I'll keep searching for new breakfast joints at those prices.  I would recommend going and trying it out yourself.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Just had an amazing breakfast at dawn patrol. Farm to table food...every bite was so fresh and delicious. Real food...nothing processed. We had a sweet potato hash topped with eggs and salsa, the breakfast burrito, and a revitalizer smoothie. 5 stars...we need more restaurants like this. Creative menu with healthy options. Well done dawn patrol. Hope to see you in Orange County one day!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Food and coffee delicious.  It's a bit of a cluster to order and then try and secure table.  Of course, like a dongle I asked a waiter if I could get an open table while my husband ordered ""no, please order first"" as I observed cute little twentysomethings snagging open tables while there fire friends ordered.   My only down side"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Just re-opened in the same space as the previous BeachBreak Cafe.  The new owner completed an amazing surf themed remodel - worth seeing on it's own.  Excellent menu layout and food options.  Love the ""build your own hash"" section.  The food was amazing, and served in a timely manner.  The best outdoor patio in the area to enjoy the Santa Barbara weather for breakfast brunch and lunch."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We were in the SB area and were looking for a good local breakfast place. We are so glad we chose Dawn Patrol! Their build your own breakfast was amazing! It was so easy to customize our meals for some of our dietary needs. The cashier was very informative and helpful while placing our order. We all loved our food! I ordered poached eggs over my hash and they were cooked perfectly. Everything was made with great quality ingredients. Their coffee was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be back!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Kind of a fail as my sausage was chicken (I'm guessing, but weird texture and absolutely tasteless) and the toast was tasteless, and I'm still hungry, but my wife enjoyed her ""build your own"" hash. Also it was too pricey. If you like clueless college students who don't know how to lock doors, you might like this place. But seriously, both my wife and I walked in on people who didn't lock the bathroom doors 15 minutes apart. Too be honest my wife would eat here again, I wouldn't."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Came here on our weekend visit to Santa Barbara for breakfast. It is not your typical sit down but rather you order at the counter and they give a little emoji table number for your order. The cashier guy who took our order could have been  more friendlier or even a little smile would've been nice but as I watched him take orders, nothing. He just looked like a cranky bearded blue eyed guy hating his job. I also ordered coffee which I wasn't given at the time of order but had to ask a food runner for. Not sure what their process was there, it was a bit confusing where you got your coffee or water or who you'd ask for more service.

Now the food, we ordered the white egg frittata & the build your own hash with almost all the veggies, bacon and scrambled eggs which is brilliant idea to build your own hash to what you like. The egg white frittata was healthy and which left me feeling super energetic. 

Food = 4.5 stars Service = 2 stars, 3 overall"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place a great stop when passing through Santa Barbara. The patio was very dog friendly which is a must when traveling with the pup. My boyfriend had the chorizo dish and I had a build your own hash plus a pancake to share. The gentleman that took our order was wonderful. Would definitely come back
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is awesome. Great location, food is fantastic, great family place and they have Gluten Free menu options. One of the best breakfast restaurants in SB."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Food is okay but overpriced. People camp out at tables without ordering and tables are too big for the space outside. Need to have smaller chairs and tables to allow more people to sit down. Could also do with an employee managing the table situation. Overall not worth the wait and long lines at the weekend.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So sad to see the Beachbreak cafe was gone. The Hawaiian french toast was awesome. After my shock I decided to try out the Dawn Patrol that is now in the Beachbreak location expecting to be disappointed my Johnny raincloud coming out. Hell if it wasn't fantastic. I had their hash with poach eggs a  scone and coffee. All were fantastic!!!
I would highly recommend you come down to Dawn Patrol and try it out
 Going to recommend to the Dawn Patrol restaurant that  they do  Hawaiian french toast :)"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great location, downtown close to the beach. Fun ambiance, good service. The food ok, not bad, not the best."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The service is friendly and the huevos rancheros hit the spot in a way I didn't think a spot in Santa Barbara could. Tables are stocked with the requisite hot sauce but plates could do without them... just enjoy the food.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Found this place on Yelp while in town for a wedding. No table service, counter service only, which creates lines out the door leaving empty tables. It doesn't really make sense as people just walked away. With 15 people in line, it's 15-20 min just to order takeout. Then another 20 minutes to get your food. The food looks amazing on Yelp which is why I waited:

The French Toast is OK.
The Hash is OK.
The Madagascar  vanilla bean latte is good."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Decided to give this place a try after seeing it had an axxess card deal and good reviews, and was pretty disappointed with the quality of food and service. I had a build your own hash and my boyfriend had the chorizo hash, both of which were really bland and nothing special. It took about 45 minutes for us to get our food, and a lot of the tables they had outside were unbalanced (causing people to spill their coffee). The location is cool and the coffee gets them an extra star, but overall it's overpriced and the food made zero impression. Would not recommend."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"A very delicious alternative breakfast!  I had the Build a Hash with sweet potatoes, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, salsa and poached eggs.  My wife tried the Prisoner Egg Muffin, which is essentially a poached egg baked inside a corn muffin.   All so good. Hot and tasty. A new favorite!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Good breakfast joint. An order at the counter kind of place. They're big on hash. Great coffee. Accepts all major cards.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Madagascar vanilla bean latte OMG Soooo good. Not to many veggie option but the breakfast burrito was delicious with a great salsa. Music inside a lil too loud for me.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Dawn Patrol is a great place for breakfast. Casual but great quality. 

There is a lovely patio for outdoor seating but plenty of space inside as well. 

You can build your own hash here:

Sweet potatoes or regular potatoes
Protein selection (recommend the corned beef)
Veggies and cheese selection
Eggs any style
Sauces- salsa gravy etc. 

Amazing homemade bread with homemade jam. 

House made orange juice is great!

Friendly staff."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Food is delicious, prices a bit high, wait time to get food was way too long 40 min. Although we were warned by cashier that there was a 20 to 25 minute wait for food because of how busy it was but 40 minutes is a long time to wait for breakfast"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Sweet potato hash was the best I've ever had!   Also tried the corn muffin but it wasn't my fav.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I was intrigued by the build your own hash, so I wanted to try this breakfast spot on a day trip to Santa Barbara. You order and pay at the counter and they bring your food to your table. We had the sweet potato, sage sausage, corn, pepper jack cheese, spinach and topped it off with poached eggs and herb aioli. The hash came with a side of toast and baby greens. I thought it was okay. The flavor of the herb aioli didn't really come through. I'd probably choose somewhere else to go for breakfast next time."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Wow - who's the girl that's super rude ?? We usually love this place BUT !!! We recently came in for breakfast while visiting SB and asked to not have onions on the special - I understand no substitutions to specials - I only asked if I could get it without onions - maybe they are sprinkled on top - I don't know - instead of the girl at the counter explaining to me whether the onions are cooked in or not she just rudely said ""nope"" when I asked if she could explain, she said "" no changes to specials, chef's rules"" without even asking the chef. Whenever we drive through or stay over in SB, we always come here - here's the things that aren't good:
1. Always cold in the morning (outside is warmer then inside on most days) 
2. Wait staff has gotten rude over the last few months 
3. Takes forever when slightly busy 
4. And then they can't cut out onions on a dish ???
Definitely noticing a decline. Not sure if I'll be coming back to this place again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Loved it! Great food and super helpful staff. Enjoyed the outdoor seating. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"We had an OK breakfast at Dawn Patrol.  My huevos rancheros included two tortillas plus tortilla strips which was too many carbs, especially since you only get one egg (which surprised me since the description of the item says ""eggs"").  Cheddar cheese would have been better than the pepper jack they use.   I did like the cilantro on the side.  
Their fresh squeezed orange juice is awesome, and they have super friendly service."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Delicious! One of the best breakfast spots  in town... build a hash is amazing! It's real food so be patient and enjoy the view, maybe with some mimosas ;) staff is very friendly, polite, and helpful! Dog friendly patio and they have these PHENOMENAL homemade dog cookies that my dog can't get enough! I highly recommend this place"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Stopped by for brunch here and I honestly thought it was just okay. Service is minimal - stand in line, order food (the cashier was nice), grab your emoji to place on your table, someone drops off food... and that's it. I completely missed the water memo (were we supposed to get it ourselves?) so ended up thirsty. I'm conflicted on whether to rate service as good or bad. The cashier was nice, but the waiters saw us waiting near an un-bussed table and didn't attempt to bus it so we could sit for a while. I noticed two other tables on the patio were also left un-bussed for a while.

The food itself was forgettable. I ordered scrambled eggs (super dry), bacon, and roasted potatoes w a scone (imagine a super dry biscuit). I forget what the bf ordered - some kinda DIY hash, but he didn't seem to remember or enjoy it much.

+1 full star for being dog-friendly and providing them w treats..but otherwise I find the food to be just meh."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"-Gross salad that came with the prisoner egg muffin. Very lemony even though there was barely any dressing. The egg muffin part was ok..wouldn't come back. 
-Mustard for the croque madam ruined the whole plate. 
-create your own hash was very good."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Tiny portions for price. I had a piece of salmon ($7), side salad ($5), and two over medium eggs ($3.50). My friend's was $12 for three home fries, two tiny, hard pieces of sausage, ""scrambled"" eggs that looked like they were made at McDonald's and soggy toast. Yikes. When she asked for butter (twice) she was only given enough to butter one piece of toast.

We were told when we walked up that you order, then find a seat. Said it'd be a 20min wait to order, then 30-40min wait for food. Ok fine; it was rush hour. Well, they were right. We ordered, then had to stalk customers that were finishing their meals for a table and waited 40min for very disappointing portions. Needless to say, I wished we'd gone to IHOP for that simple of a breakfast and service."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Spectacular menu & delicious food! The hospitality of the employees is amazing! Might be a challenge finding parking, but it's the POT O GOLD at the end of the rainbow!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Move over Cajun Kitchen and Jeannine's, there is a new breakfast spot in town. 

Dawn Patrol is bringing the vibes and quality of an LA or SF breakfast spot to Santa Barbara. 

Completely new, you walk into Dawn Patrol and order your breakfast at the counter. My fiancée and I both built our own hash, straying away from our normal high sugar breakfasts. After ordering we moved over to comfortable seats on the patio with our cute hula dancer figurine to identify our order. 

Immediately we were offered water and ensured our breakfast would be arriving shortly. 

I had the sage sausage with an egg over easy which was cooked perfectly. The egg mixed with the hash browns and sausage were the perfect combination of deliciousness.

The lady had an egg over easy mixed with shredded chicken and salsa which was excellent and surprisingly healthy. The portion size was on point (too big for her, but exactly what I would need). The egg oozing into chicken and salsa tasted like heaven in our mouths. 

Prices were as to be expected in Santa Barbara, but the quality far surpasses what you can normally get anywhere else. 

Highly recommended, don't forget a mimosa to top off an epic breakfast. 

PS make sure to check out the tile in the bathrooms!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Awesome vibes at this breakfast spot. We came on a Monday and it was consistently busy so if you are coming on a weekend there could be a wait. Create your own hash ! Yummy! So much food and great tasting. Best part is that the staff is friendly and they were playing Reggae music. Super happy !
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Very good food I enjoyed the atmosphere the staff was very friendly I like places where you pay first and choose your own seats
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The food was really good here only downside the service was super slow. But everything else was great. Me and my sister got the Huevo Rancheros and it was so good and the presentation was so pretty and my mom got the Breakfast Burrito. I think for breakfast/brunch it's a great place to go too.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Food was excellent and the service was even better!! Will definitely be back soon!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This was one of the best breakfast places I've ever been to. I would highly recommend the build-your-own hash. It was delicious and filling without being too much. In addition, they have great vegan options without compromising the experience for meat eaters. And it is in a great location as it is right on state street. Definitely go if you're in Santa Barbara. (Would also like to add that the music was great!)"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday while visiting Santa Barbara. We waited for a while in line to order and waited another while for the food. The food was great! I ordered build your own hash with sweet potatoes, bacon, eggs and herb aioli!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great spot in Santa Barbara. The service is amazing and the food is so delicious. The Madagascar vanilla bean latte is soooooo tasty and to die for. Ate their twice during my visit out there and is now a must stop whenever I go back.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Yum! You can't go wrong with the build a hash. The line was long but we did show up at 10:00, prime breakfast time."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I took a to-go order of the build your own hash and found I probably won't be returning. 

The food was okay, it was cooked decently and the presentation was fine enough but it was much too expensive. The expensive part didn't help when I got back to my office after waiting for the to-go order for 20 minutes to find that I didn't have the avocado I ordered ($2) and it still had potatoes which I asked for no potatoes. 

Overall I found myself scarfing down the food to get back to work, with the disappointment in this mediocre (and wrong) lunch continuing to grow with every bite. 

Maybe I got unlucky but I don't believe I'll find myself going to Dawn Patrol again or recommending it."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place is perfect if you need a place to go with dogs. Food was really good. I was able to make my meal vegan.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The preface:
-Three friends and I tried Dawn Patrol for brunch on a Sunday at 11:30am.

The good:
-The create-your-own-hash was tasty; not memorable enough that I'll wake up craving hash in the middle of the night, but a solid breakfast option.

The bad:
-Absurdly long wait times. We waited in a line headed by a single cashier for 35-40 minutes, and then another 25 minutes for our food. There's really no reason to use this ordering system over traditionally seating people unless you have at least two cashiers working at once; as it is it's just an enormous bottleneck. I had a feeling we would be waiting for a while when I was in line looking around to see what people were eating and noticed that hardly anyone had their food. Some might argue that, well, of course we waited a long time since we went at the busiest time on the busiest day. I would agree except that Dawn Patrol appears to change nothing about their process regardless of how long the line out the door is.
-Certain menu items are insanely overpriced. $7 for a large single-serving orange juice + hash with avocado (for an extra $2) brought my breakfast total to $23 before tip.
-Food was good, but not good enough to justify the price, and certainly not enough of it to justify the price either.
-I'm always hesitant to comment on the quality of the staff since I know everyone has bad days, but ""disinterested"" is the word that comes to mind on this particular day. I'm not factoring this into my rating since I've worked enough food jobs to know that I may have just come in on an off day.

Overall, it was an ok brunch marred by ridiculous prices and long wait times, and at least the latter could be easily avoided by just committing another cashier when the line starts to grow. There are simply too many good alternatives in Santa Barbara to spend two hours here eating brunch."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"It was good, good service, fast, you can make it healthy and it tastes pretty good but honestly nothing memorable or special. I probably wouldn't go back.."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place checks all the breakfast needs boxes. And emoji flare doesn't hurt either. That is all.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,LOVE the benedict! The choice of bread matches with the egg and avocado :) the fried potato could be hotter though- same for my other friends who got the fried potatoes as a side. We felt that they had them all pre cooked but didn't warm them before serving. Overall good experience! The bar tender was funny and played some tricks while we were waiting for our table too :)
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"By far the best breakfast I've ever had at a restaurant.  Ordered the build a hash with: russet pots, corned beef, spinach, tomatoes, pepper jack, topped with the fire-roasted salsa with the wheat bread. The outside seating is so inviting with a cool breeze, the staff is friendly and efficient.  Such a great find on vacation morning!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I hope these guys make it in the tough restaurant game, because they deserve to.  They've obviously put a lot of work into the restaurant, and it shows with a cool, hip vibe.  

We went on a Monday morning, so it was pretty quiet.   Service from the young guy behind the counter was low-key, super friendly, but very professional.  I got a hash, my wife got a breakfast sandwich, and they did a kid's pancake for our little guy....all the food was excellent, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.   The fresh greens on the side were a nice little surprise.   

This may sound kind of goofy, but the iced coffee and toast were some of the best I've ever had...it's the little things that make all the difference!  We don't live in SB, but would come here every week if we did.   Already looking forward to our next visit.   Keep up the good work, guys."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Mmmm, came to this place while wandering State Street looking for breakfast. My friend got the pancakes, which were delicious. And I got the build your own hash which was amazing. You order at the counter and seat yourself. Solid food and it seemed pretty healthy too. Check it out :)"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great food. Very fresh and organic. Great service.  Great atmosphere. Loved everything about it. Highly recommended.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Our family had the build your own hash, veggie omelette and the gluten free pancakes.  Maybe I have lived a sheltered life, but this was one of the best breakfasts we have ever had.  The people and service were really cool too"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Good Hash, coffee and fresh oj. We had to wait a bit in line since its first come first serve, but worth it!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is my ""go to"" breakfast and brunch place in town. The gluten free pancakes are the best around. You can tell that all the food is prepared with care. The portion sizes are perfect, and the staff friendly. I only wish they had a little more space!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Loved this place! 
I had a build your own hash, which was super yummy. I paired my meal with orange juice. Let me tell you, this was the BEST orange juice I have ever had! It was so fresh and delicious. 
I wish I lived in Santa Barbara so I can go here often. I will revisit the area just for this place though."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is probably the best brunch I've had so far during my roadtrip from San Francisco to LA. The build a hash is spot on. You can choose your own kind of potato and ingredients. There are a bunch of other dishes on the menu too. We sat outside and it was very pleasant. Even though you go to the counter to order and then sit down, the service was excellent too. You should ask the waiter for butter and jam, because they have a delicious homemade strawberry and kiwi jam for your toast or scones."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Stopped by for breakfast when I was in town and wandering State St for the day. 

Pros:
- My made-to-order hash was delicious and came with a nice side of salad and toast. I ordered a poached egg on top and it came out beautifully.
- Service was friendly.

Cons:
- The line was long and it took me over 20 minutes to order.
- I then waited an additional 40 minutes to receive my food.

Not sure if this wait is normal given the popularity, but it would probably deter me from any future visits unless I had a lot of time to kill."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Was originally wanting to head over to Rebar Coffeehouse, but to my dismay they were shut down! :( So since this place was pretty much next door, I gave them a shot, and I'm very glad I did. It's a pretty simple menu, but you can customize your own hashes, and they also have some other solid breakfast staples as well as your standard lunch fare (i.e. Burgers, salads). The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful as well as the rest of the staff I interacted with. Very clean and cute place. And most importantly DELICIOUS food. The only complaint I have is the price, but I deem it irrelevant since we are in Santa Barbara after all, so technically the prices are what I like to call ""SB standard"". Definitely come check this place out. Oh...and the coffee is killer!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Love this place for breakfast! Healthier then your average breakfast place, but still delicious! I love ordering their hash any way you like it. Two different types of potatoes to start with tons of toppings to chose from. Mix and match toppings and sauces, the hollandaise is on point, so yummy! I also love how they serve your breakfast with a side of salad with light italian dressing because I love salad. They make homemade orange juice which is sometimes hard to find in Santa Barbara, it's delish! I usually order to go because I live so close but the restaurant is cute and service is good and everyone is nice.3 stars because the place is small inside and it can be hard getting a seat sometimes. Also, the last time I went in to order breakfast to go they told me it would take 45 minutes because of how many people were there. Too long to wait for breakfast without a seat!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Yummy hash, good coffee, friendly staff. Not truly open early enough--I suppose the staff are taking advantage of dawn patrol in the surf!  Give it a try--sage sausage hash scramble was awesome!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Stood inline for a stupid amount of time. But was surprised at how fast the food came out honestly. Good sized portions which was nice but nothing was super flavorful. I didn't hate it but it didn't have a lot going on either.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"For the price, the quality and quantity of food are disappointing. I got the Patrol (photo attached) and was still hungry after--I usually can't finish my entres. The boyfriend got the special, chorizo hash, which he thought was good and mildly filling. Our coffee was decent but nothing special. For $45, I expected more, especially considering there's really no table service.

Unrelated to my scoring, I think it's annoying that people sit down and reserve seats before they order. I think the establishment should remind the patrons to be more considerate of others. For example, this family with a baby (and a baby stroller) had to wait after they ordered while this couple held a table for four and never ordered because they were waiting to grab a table for six and for their friends to arrive."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The cheese and pepper scone!!! The coffee!!! So good. Thank you for being so accommodating to us. Our only suggestion is to have heating lamps for cold days. Thank you!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I wish Yelp allowed for multiple ratings. If it did, I would give high marks for the taste/quality of the food, but very low marks for the service (what service??). We've gone twice now, and each time it seemed like the waitstaff was asleep at the wheel. Both times they took *forever* to bring us coffee/water/silverware. Both times they forgot to bring us the scone we ordered until after they brought out our main meal. When I finally got someone to refill my coffee cup and I asked her for more cream, she said, ""oh you have to go get that yourself inside."" 
You know, if this was a relatively cheap diner, I guess I wouldn't mind having to most of the work myself (you have to order at the counter, get your own drinks set up), but breakfast for 2 of us came to almost $50 for 2 entrees, scones (because they don't even give you any toast or English muffin with your eggs), and coffee. For that kind of cash, I'd expect better service. Any service. Without having to constantly ask for it. 
I miss BeachBreak. I miss the servers at BeachBreak. My guess is that Dawn Patrol won't last unless they get their act together and step it up. 
Oh, and here's a shot of the butter that came with my scone. I actually had to ask if they gave me someone else's partially eaten one???!! Gross."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Waited in line for 30min to order food even though there were tons of open tables everywhere. Once ordered took another 25min before even getting our food. There were so many bussers just waiting around and doing a great job of pretending they were super busy drying cups. One busser literally only went back and forth replacing the water jugs and silverware at the self service bar then stood around while the poor cashier was clearly struggling with taking orders, pouring drinks, and doing many other things. We as well as many others had to walk up to the kitchen just to get coffee refills. Even though there were tons of bussers several tables still had dirty plates on them for long stretches of time. Not only that, but the couple in line after us got their food before us. We ordered the chorizo hash and it was sub par with hardly any chorizo. Definitely not worth the wait and more frustrating than anything that this place had such high reviews and was such a let down. So many people who were waiting in line behind us left because it was taking forever... we should have followed their lead."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I came here for breakfast the other morning with my family and we had an excellent breakfast! When we arrived, it was super busy and there was quite a line. So if it's busy when you go, I highly recommend that someone else in your party goes to find a table while someone else waits in line. You order at the counter and then they bring your food to your table. You choose an emoji to put at your table so that they know where to bring the food. I thought that was a cute idea. The prices weren't bad. 

All of the staff there were super friendly and nice. They got us everything we needed and were pleasant. 

For breakfast, I got the ""Build your own hash"" and got mine with russet potatoes, corned beef, tomatoes, corn, avocado, cheddar cheese, eggs and hollandaise sauce. The hash was excellent! Super tasty. The corned beef was some of the best corned beef that I've had. It was very flavorful. I also got a single pancake and this was good too--nice and fluffy.

Overall, nice restaurant (clean and decorated nicely), staff is very friendly, food is excellent, and the prices are fair. I definitely recommend!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Tasty grub!  The line took a while to get to the front.  We went on a Saturday morning and the place was very busy.  Once it arrived, we really like the ""hash"" meals we ordered."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Stop scrolling. This is the place you want to have breakfast. We had the Eggs Benedict and the Build-Your-Own Hash. Both were amazing. A fresh squeezed OJ, two fantastic coffees, and a fresh fruit side later, and I'm convinced that this is one of the best meals I've ever enjoyed. Plus, bonus points for their condiment selection: Sriracha, jalapeño and regular Tabasco, and Tapatio (the So Cal staple). Rock on, Dawn Patrol."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Good food, but it can be hectic getting a table (especially on the weekends). Might be worth considering doing table service?

The build your own hash is a cool option."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Best breakfast in SB!!!! Loved the croque madam and the traditional hash! They do it the best! Loved it!!!

Don't hesitate to come and enjoy a delicious experience!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great place to eat! We had the Pancakes... KILLER! Prisoner egg... YUMMY! Hash plate #hashtag good! Croque Madame... A MUST!
Sausage... Fresh! Thanks Dawn Patrol see you again"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Mixed feelings overall; somewhere between three and four stars...

Be prepared to wait a LONG TIME for food. Well, be prepared to wait a long time in line (45min) before even ordering, and then maybe another 30-40min for your food. Seems that they would benefit from another cashier, another cook, and another runner. 

My husband got a create-your-own hash and thought it was absolutely phenomenal - he couldn't stop raving about that, and he rarely does that. On and on about how the wait was worth it, and I agree - his meal was excellent, filling and savory and all other good things. The whole wheat toast that came with his meal was some of the best bread we've ever had as well. 

I got an egg white frittata - while this would sound healthy, it was super greasy and buttery; there must've been a stick of butter in the pan in which they cooked it. I mean, we're talking oily butterness galore. Regardless, it was perfectly baked; tasty and well-seasoned overall albeit a very small portion for the price. It's a fancy tourist town, so I get that. I wasn't as head-over-heels for my meal as my husband was, but it was still solid and tasty

In addition to the wait, my husband ordered coffee but they never gave it to him till the very end of the meal - we had to ask three times. In addition, the table staff were very scattered, not particularly attentive to us but much more attentive to the tables around us. 

A good place overall; ultimately would recommend the create-your-own hash thing and getting your caffeine beforehand as you settle in for the wait."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Excellent customer service and food!  Dog friendly place.  I thought the food choices were adequate and not overwhelming.  I had the create your own hash.  Food was delicious and was just the right portion.  Customer service was attentive and prompt.  Best time to go is during the weekday.  Had brunch at this place on a Thursday and the place was not crowded.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place is amazing. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. It's counter ordering so order and sit outside for some fresh. I made my own hash and it was filling and delicious.  I also ordered a half order of buttermilk pancakes which were also amazing.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"We were visiting from out of town and looking for a place to eat brunch before our long drive home. This place did the job but wasn't spectacular or anything.

I found this place via Yelp (thanks fellow Yelp-ers!) so I was prepared for the experience to take some time due to the popularity and it being a Sunday. We found parking a few blocks away and got in line before noon. It was busy but not totally packed. We were easily able to snag a large, comfortable table for our party of 6. 

I opted for the Aloha French toast and it was good and just the right portion for me. I also had two scrambled eggs that were delicious. The rest of my party was content with their food. We were slightly disappointed in the smaller portions for the amount of money. We are used to Hash House a-go go though (amazing place if you're ever near one). I was happy with the quality of food and ingredients which is more important to me. 

It did take awhile for us to order and another wait before our food was brought out. If I did not know to expect a wait beforehand I would have been annoyed. 

My mimosa was also tasty and well-balanced. 

Kids were happy with their pancakes too. 

I would say this is a solid place to grab brunch. It sure as hell beats a Denny's."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This may be my favorite dining experience in California. Food was impeccable, service was beyond friendly and full of personality, and the ambiance was amazing. Prices weren't bad either! I got a Build a Hash with pretty much everything on it, and can honestly say it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. This place is easily missed, but well worth a visit."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Saw they had great reviews and thought we'd try it out- don't waste your time.

We didn't mind waiting in the long line because we were expecting a delicious meal.

Timing:
Took about 30 minutes in line to order.  About an hour after that to get our breakfast. 

Service: 
Nothing special, you order and eventually someone brings your food.

Cleanliness:
Bathrooms were pretty dirty.  Busser, I assume only one because I only saw one working his butt off, worked quickly to turn over tables.  He basically just wiped food off table to floor or seats.  He'd probably do better if he wasn't the only one running around like crazy.

Atmosphere:
It was VERY busy inside and out.  Dogs on the patio.  I was really irritated though that I was sitting inside and the corner booth next to me had a smallish dog (like a shitzu) in the booth with them and the dog walked along the booth to me.  I am not a fan of pets inside a restaurant and people not keeping their pets to themselves.  Sorry.  

Food:
I had their luau French toast, it was good but nothing special.  Best part of my plate was probably the strawberries.  
Side of bacon, asked for it crispy and they mixed up my side with someone else's so they switched it out.
Hubby had the custom hash.  Sausage, potatoes and veggies.  He was really disappointed with the flavor and had some of my toast instead.  

Wish we had tried another place."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,My fiancé and I came here for breakfast before our drive back home. We both ordered the hash. I got mine with russet potato corned beef avocado cheddar cheese and the herb aioli. We sat down at a table and we literally waited 56 minutes for our food. We were super frustrated because we really wanted to get on the road and beat traffic. Also other customers kept getting up to either complain or leave because they were tired of waiting. After 56 minutes of waiting we finally got our food. Luckily it was really good but I would never wait an hour again for it. I'm sure they are not used to it being so busy but still you need to either hire more help during the holidays or find out another way to get the food out to people faster.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I came on a Saturday morning the second weekend of January with the boyfriend for brunch and we were both really impressed. I had the prisoner egg muffin with a side of the house made rosemary sausage and to be honest it was SO good and I was so focused on devouring it I barely remember glancing at what my boyfriend had but given we both had hangovers from a night out at another awesome spot the Good Lion I'm just happy we were upright. 

I would highly recommend the prisoner egg muffin if you enjoy a sweet savory breakfast/brunch option; the egg was perfectly cooked on the inside just a slightly runny yoke and my side of sausage was really tasty, the perfect add on to make it feel like a complete meal. Definitely a must go in our book!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great Build Your Own Hash! I had a Russet potato, sage sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and sage aioli hash. I also ordered a black coffee which was deliciously strong. The hash was yummy (considering I made up the combo on the fly) and was given to us just before our hangry phase started. 
My friends and I drove into SB for the day and came here for brunch before laying out on the beach. We came on a 3 day weekend, so it was a little busy but we managed to find a table. 

Great little spot!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The food was good, however there was a long wait just to order at the counter. That's fine, but then we waited another 45 minutes for the food to arrive (for counter service!). During the long wait we of course drank our coffee, too bad there are no refills on coffee. That's pretty crazy and super disappointing.

If this place didn't make you wait so long after ordering and offered a refill on coffee, it would be 5 stars."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Build your own hash is ahhhmazing. The food was fresh. Coffee is delish and service is great. The atmosphere is super chill and dog friendly on the patio. I will absolutely be back again.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We were looking for a good brunch/breakfast place in Santa Barbara, and we stumbled across Dawn Patrol.  I built my own hash, and it was phenomenal.  My girlfriend had fresh squeezed OJ (that was actually fresh squeezed), and an amazing breakfast plate.

We will definitely stop back when we are in town again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"You have to try the hash! Build your own...potatoes, corned beef, spinach, pepper jack cheese, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was for sure a winner. I was worried it would be too big but it turned out to be a reasonable portion size. My boyfriend ordered the juevos rancheros and enjoyed them, but agreed my order was the winner. Friendly staff take your order and give you an emoji for your table (seat yourself). So why only 4 stars - 2 reasons, parking is difficult to find based on the given location and the seat yourself model is not my fave."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,People are very friendly. The food is delicious and made with fresh products. The service is very slow though.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I love the ability to make your own hash, as this is unlike many restaurants. 
I have never really mixed sweet potato with egg, but I took a chance and ended up loving it. The options are endless and there is something for everyone. 
Going to return to Dawn Patrol :)"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Visited this place during the July 4th week for breakfast. The location isn't the easiest place to spot and we actually past it up while walking since it's right near the walkway under 101 HWY.  Just remember it's next door to Casa Blanca (the white building).  We ordered the hash plate, luau french toast and organic oatmeal.  The food was very good although the corn beef was a bit stringy and not cut up in smaller pieces.  Service and workers were friendly and helpful.  We will definitely be back again when visiting SB."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Do not spend your time nor money here. You will wait 45 minutes to eat, have to aggressively angle for a table, and consume sub-par, flavorless, joyless food. Perhaps all the positive reviews were written by starving customers who were finally fed, but if I'm paying at least $50 for two entrees and coffee, my expectations are a bit higher. Everything was cooked in unsalted butter, and seasoning was not employed by the establishment. The whole process of standing in line, waiting to order, and then pitting myself against other customers was not worth the end product. -1 star for flavorless food, -1 star for long wait, -1 star for lack of seating, -1 star for price."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place rocks! Gluten free option sub out almonds for granola. You can't find anything like it anywhere else!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Came here before heading back home. We will definitely be back on our next visit to SB. The food was delicious with all fresh ingredients
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Exceptional! A delicious alternative to breakfast...create your own hash. Fantastic ambience, food & customer service."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Nope. Just avoid. 

I invited my aunt to breakfast at Dawn Patrol and was so embarrassed to have picked such a terrible place for our meal. 

During the busy morning, the harried sweaty manager took our table # off the table and as I chased after him to get it back our booth was snagged by another party. 

I couldn't get anyone's attention for service. I found myself muttering excuse me excuse me over and over to no avail. The people that snagged our both were promptly served water and provided with flatware as we stood around waiting for another table to cleared off. Did we get an apology? No. 

When our food arrived we realized it didn't come with toast. I don't know about you but I have come to expect at least a damn slice with a breakfast plate and for $15 it seemed safe to assume there would be.

After another round of excuse me's I caught the attention of the girl bussing tables and asked if they offered toast. She was kind enough to take our order to the kitchen but returned to say the harried sweaty manager said we needed to get in line to order- the line that stretched from the counter to the sidewalk out on State St. 

Sorry, he's in a bad mood she said. So there you have it. I couldn't trouble them with an order of toast. 

With our food getting cold we decided to try to salvage our meal together and enjoy each other's company. And vowing never to return again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We were there for breakfast over the Thanksgiving weekend and loved it! They use organic eggs and everything we tried were awesome so I would most definitely highly recommend this place for everybody who wants to have a healthy and delicious breakfast with great people!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great service breakfast brunch and lunch items. Delicious lattes with coconut or soy options. The portions are good sized. We ordered a kale quinoa salad added a poached salmon cooked to perfection. Also ordered a huge cheese burger the first time it was served to us it seemed uncooked. The manager was able to accommodate the correction promptly as well as a refund. Plenty of seating indoor and outdoor with a surfer theme. Parking lot was close by.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Traveled to Santa Barbara for our first time and was referred here by a friend at the next door climbing gym for breakfast. Wow were they right! This place has deliciously amazing healthy breakfast options!
We ordered the breakfast burrito and the egg white frittata and I have yet to crave another breakfast dish that has left me so satisfied without the gut bomb 30minutes after. Their fruit is so fresh and of good portions too!
The staff was so delightful and very attentive, and the restaurant has a great outdoor seating area. I would recommend this place to anyone I know traveling to the area, great job guys!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great new breakfast spot. Had a hash with veggie sausage, vegetables and salsa. Good stuff. Would pass on the tea, pot is a bit small. Very friendly and helpful staff. Outdoor patio protected from the weather.

Definitely dog friendly, a major plus!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The breakfast is delicious. I've come a couple times now and they don't disappoint! I order the huevos rancheros and they're great and really balanced there's the right amount of cheese, egg and sauce. The green sauce is my favorite and has the perfect amount of kick to go with the citrus flavor. You look the menu over and order up front then seat yourself, they have a special machine for the fresh squeezed orange juice and bean grinder for their yummy coffee drinks. They offer beer and wine options and a great cider which is always a plus in my book. It's not waiter service but they pay attention to their customers and are always nice about special requests. The atmosphere is laid back and they have good music playing without it being too loud. Overall a really great place for breakfast or lunch. 

Parking is a little difficult but the public lot across the street is free for the first 75 minutes!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I would give this place 2.5 stars.  We tried the build a hash and the devilish french toast.  Most of the ingredients in the hash were fresh, the eggs were poached well, and the hollandaise sauce was good.  However, the russet potatoes in the hash and the french toast itself were both on the mushy side.  These were major components of our dishes, so it was a bit disappointing."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I love this place. They are not very organized, though and when busy seem to have a knack for running into problems. I will continue to go here due to their delicious free range eggs and amazing fresh squeezers orange juice."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great being able to build your own breakfast. People like options even simple ones. Came here with my wife and we both enjoyed our food.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We ordered the Patrol Combo for breakfast with a side of a pancake. I'll have to say that the whole staff are friendly and the ambiance of the place is very positive. I noticed that the kitchen is neat and very well maintained/organized. The food is well worth the price and you wont be disappointed.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So worth it! We were thinking about going to breakfast on the beach by our hotel & even stopped in a nice-looking restaurant & ordered coffee. ...view of the beach & pier. Just beautiful. But the menu did not excite me. I kept seeing all the pictures from Dawn Patrol in my head. So happy we left the place on the beach. I am not a fan of corned beef. Every St. Patty's Day I hear people talk it up & get excited. Never me. But I had corned beef, eggs over easy w/sweet potatoes & fire roasted salsa w/corn, tomatoes & avocado. Oh! So good! My husband had the chorizo hash special & he's a great cook, but even he was happy I made him abandon the beach. Dawn Patrol is worth the stroll away from the ocean. We're definitely coming back next time we visit our son @ UCSB. Dark chocolate mocha was not too sweet, definitely way less than 1/2 the sweetness of any mocha @ Starbucks & still less sweet than Peet's version. Great music & atmosphere. Professional staff. Will be back soon"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I was in Santa Barbara for a few days and used Yelp to find a new breakfast spot for me and my 2 local hosts. Our tastes are all different, so the build your own hash really appealed to me. Food was fresh and delicious, and nicely portioned - and came with a side salad! What??? Salad for breakfast?!? It was surprisingly light and tasty, and complemented the main dish well. The staff was friendly and patient with us newbies. My local friends were happy with the new find - and vowed to return!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,This place  got really  good music. It does require  the customer  to do allot in order to  get taken care. If you  are looking  for  breakfast  without  having  much to do this is not the place  for you.  The food is not above average.  We got raw pork sausage and it kinda  ruined  breakfast.   The coffee  was great  and there was a wonderful  lady who works there who washelping  me save a bird  that was trapped  between  a couch but the manager  was not very nice and told her to stop because  she had tables to crank up.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"What a cool and delicious restaurant! Stopped in here to have breakfast before a wedding and it really hit the spot! It's the type of restaurant that you order when you come in then sit down and wait for your food (which was perfect since we had to be somewhere in an hour).

My mother in law and I ordered the egg white frittata (it comes with half of an avo rolled in yummy seeds it was so good), my husband got their breakfast burrito, wolfed that down, and they make Mickey Mouse pancakes (complete with a fruit smiley face) for kids! My daughter is a super picky eater and she gobbled hers up! Excellent food!

The coffee was super good too and if it seems like it takes a little longer than normal for it to be served after you order it it's because they brew it in house and it tasted excellent!

The decor in this restaurant is also extremely cool. All surfer themed! The hooks in the bathroom are surf board fins and the tiles in the restroom are pieces of actual skateboards! Loved all those touches.

The next time we are in SB we will definitely be back!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We stopped in here on our way to Pismo and were not disappointed. I built my hash and my husband had the eggs benedict. Everything tasted fresh and had a great flavor. The herb aioli was good but it had a strong flavor so I am happy they suggested to have it on the side instead of on top of the hash. Neat decor and good reggae music to accompany the great food. Would definitely stop here again while visiting Santa Barbara.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I was disappointed in high price (low value), long wait time, and small portion size.

I ordered the ""build a hash"" with russet potatoes, pepper, onion, mushroom, corned beef, scrambled egg, roasted salsa at 10:13am. My friend got a very similar meal.

I was surprised to see that salad took up ~1/3 of the plate when it wasn't even mentioned on the menu board. Also, I was surprised that an orange juice cost $5 for ~10oz.

On the positive side, I liked the taste.
I didn't measure the wait time but it seemed to be ~15 minutes which seems long since it did not seem very busy/crowded."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Stopped over from a drive to have breakfast and wow! Great pancakes and eggs Benedict! Service was pretty quick and good also. Must recommend for people looking for some breakfast.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The line was long when we came, but it was totally worth the wait and we had no trouble getting a table. We had the chorizo hash (a special) and the prisoner egg muffin. The portion for the hash was very generous and the flavor was great. The prisoner egg muffin was cooked perfectly, with the egg yolk oozing (yes, oozing) out as I cut into the muffin. I was impressed that the corn muffin was cooked all the way through without the egg being overdone - quite a feat! It was served with a side salad which was nicely dressed. This is definitely a good option if you want something savory and a little on the lighter side. To drink we had regular house coffee and a dark chocolate mocha. The regular coffee was good, whereas the dark chocolate mocha was just fine. I think when you put the words ""dark chocolate"" into anything my heart flutters, but in the end the mocha didn't really stand out. I'd probably cheap-out next time and just get regular drip coffee."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place was a pleasant surprise.  Decided to go here for the BOGO axxess card deal, and our expectations were far exceeded.  The woman taking orders at the register was the definition of friendly and thorough.  Our food came out and was delicious.  I ate it so fast I forgot to take a picture, or else I would have shared am image of the ""Build Your Own Hash"" I put together. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"As a family we frequented this location for many years before it was Dawn Patrol.  Don't picture a 'surf-shack-greasy-spoon' with reasonable prices.  This place is high-end and expensive.  Yet another wait in line to order and then get your food delivered type of place.  You also have to visit a coffee station for add-ins.  Do you tip at a place like this?  Mmmmmm...

Oh yes - the food!  Make your own hash is a creative idea and for my 20 yr.old son a tasty breakfast.  I ordered 2 over easy eggs and coffeecake - great.  

Outside eating area is classy and so are the bathrooms."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is a good place to have a breakfast. but it was pretty expensive. But you definitely can taste the freshness of their products. My wife and I were on vacation in Santa Barbara. So I need to say that these guys have treated us well but nobody told us how their system works. Go Inline - Order your Wish - look for a free seat - grab a bottle of water(It's free) - and wait for your dish. 
But the experience was anyway absolutely great."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The food was really good. Build your own hash was great! However, if you are starving, the plate is not that big ... so order something else on the side.

I really enjoyed the jam because it tasted quite natural. Definitely give it a try.

When we went on a weekend, it wasn't busy. It's a nice casual atmosphere."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Nice casual breakfast place. Good coffee. Very nice employees. Despite recommendations to have the hash, I went for the French toast and wasn't disappointed. Fun to sit outside and watch the acorn woodpeckers work in the palm tree next to the restaurant."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Too hip for me

I've put Dawn Patrol off for a while baste on price alone. $13 for 2 eggs, meat side, toast and potatoes? Cajun Kitchen offers more choices for under $10, Mesa Cafe @ $10.25 but Tupelo Junction bumps it up to $14 for their, standard breakfast and I'm not even going to talk about at Scarlett Begonia's ridiculous $15 (they do thrown in fruit). A 50%+ swing in breakfast cost is not something to bat an eyelash at and all adds up in the end. Costs aside, I owed to myself to spend a couple of bucks and see if the hype is real.

Since this is trendy Hash House (a-go-go), I'm up for a Build-a-Hash for $12.50
Options chosen:
Russet potato, peppers and onions-
Sage sausage-
Mushrooms, spinach, diced tomatoes and pepper jack cheese-
Topped with eggs over easy-
Smothered with country gravy-

Stood in line for 8min with another 20 before the food was up. Instead is a number, choose your own emoji. I picked ""Unicorn"" for our table. 

Overall the food was good although is was agonist 30 minutes from arrival to eatage. That's fine for a nice place but this is a beach shack. I suspect the natural ingredients and fresh preparation are one cause to the slow down the coffee drinking is another. 

While in line, I watch one of the many bearded ones take orders. It is a slow process, I get that, to build your own hash. It's allot to remember as you're standing in line (sarcasm). Add to that the order taker would pause often to drink coffee. I guess it's hot near the kitchen and you need a refreshing cup of joe to keep you going. This seemed an unnecessary distraction. Drink on your coffee break.   

The location is odd. I visited the previous diner over the years and was not a fan of the concrete surroundings of the State Street underpass.

I may come back to try the Patrol Burger $13 but not for breakfast. Not my type of place."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Finally, a convenient and well priced breakfast spot close to my home! Walking here is no issue, and I have never complained about waiting in line - it's always been worth it. The breakfast burrito is a perfect staple and the staff (every time) has been extremely helpful and friendly."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is definitely my favorite breakfast spot because I love hash and order wherever I go. This is obviously the best (next to Kliens Truckstop which is no longer around) of all that I've tried. The ambiance, staff, and menu are all so much fun. The food is very fresh and prepared just how you ask for, and I'm very picky.  I wish they would come to Fresno,"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Delicious hash but expect small portions! I got mine eggless so it would have been nice if there'd been extra potatoes thrown in to fill the gap. Soooo delicious with the sage sausage that I ordered it again because I was still hungry!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great place for breakfast. Came here two days in a row during our weekend trip. Loved the chorizo hash. The pancakes where good. The fish tacos where good but tinge fish was a little dry.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Was excited to try out this spot. Waited in line to what seemed to not be a very busy restaurant. Clearly open tables. The cashier stopped us before we could even order and said there would be a 30 minute wait for food. Then said he would check if it was less, and came back and said it would be longer. We agreed and began to order at which point he cut us off again and ran back to the kitchen once more. Then returned and stared at us saying nothing. At this point we felt like he did not want us to place an order. Most uncomfortable service situation. Felt like they did not want our service. Ended up leaving feeling dumbfounded. Very awkward and unprofessional"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Not a lot of fancy food just good rib sticking goodness! They are famous for their hash and it is yummy! It is a perfect meal for a day of wine tasting or hanging on the beach. I also really liked their Madagascar Vanilla Latte! It really hit the spot! And the fact that you can pick your own ingredients to make your own hash it just fun! I had the special of the day which was chorizo hash, I had it with sweet potatoes and it was a nice mix of sweet and spicy."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,My husband and I were in town for the weekend and decided to eat brunch here based on reviews. We were not disappointed!! The hash and pancakes were delicious and so were the mimosas and coffee. Can't wait to go back tomorrow!!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So yummy!  First time here...pets welcome on the patio :)  The frittata with potatos and avocado covered in seeds was delish, and my pancakes were legit.  Coffee was even strong - yay!!  The young guy who was, at times, running the register and clearing the table next to us was SO nice and welcoming and gracious as we left!  Interesting location, just pay attention to the map, and park a block away. We will return!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Got there around 11am on Friday and was greeted by an incredibly nice and helpful guy who took my order. 
This was my first visit and I decided to build my own hash. I chose the sweet potatoes, scrambled eggs, sage sausage, spinach, cheddar, tomatoes, corn, avocado, and hollandaise. Literally one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! The food took a little while, but we'll worth the wait.
They also have outdoor, mostly shaded, seating."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"""Coffee station"" was really inconvenient. Don't try to make me get up from my breakfast to prepare my coffee at a sit down restaurant. Really nice staff though!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Traditional American brunch restaurant. You can build your own hash. You have to order and pay at the counter and grab your own sign to your table. The server will bring your dish to you. The quantity of food really big and the salad really fresh. The quality of food is good.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We ordered the huevos rancheros and the prisoner egg muffin, and both dishes were fantastic. Everything that passed by our table looked enticing enough to come again tomorrow while we are vacationing in Santa Barbara. Our server was lovely, kind, and super helpful. We couldn't be more delighted with this place."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Came here late morning on a Monday and it took over 50 minutes to get our food. It's toast and eggs, traditionally the fastest food to prepare. It would've been nice to know the wait time would be that long in advance. Just to be clear this was after placing an order and being seated, it's not as though we were in a crazy line up out the door to be seated for brunch on a Sunday like at other establishments. I'd say the place was half full. The couple that came in after us complained and was offered a free coffee cake. We were waiting far longer and weren't offered any such accommodation. 

The food was good don't get me wrong, but not at all good enough to justify the wait time."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great casual breakfast spot!! They have a California/Mexicana inspired menu with some delicious baked items available as well. Some dishes are creative, and they also have standbys like a breakfast burrito and huevos rancheros. There is no waiter service - you order at the counter and they bring you the food. The dining area was clean and the decor was surfer-chic. We went in a group of 4 and tried a lot of different items; everything I tasted was delish!! Great spot."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Had high hopes for Dawn Patrol based on the photo of their gluten-free pancakes. Well, they're just OK. The gluten-free pumpkin pancakes at Trader Joe's from a mix are 100 times better than these. Trust me. We also had the coffee cake which was dry as a bone and had hardly any crumble. Based on these two menu items, I wouldn't come back. It's a friendly, bright,  open space, though."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We almost didn't stay to eat here because it didn't look like much. But SO glad we stayed!!! The build your own hash was incredible. I got sweet potato base with onions and corn and shredded chicken and poached eggs. My husband was more of a traditionalist with corned beef hash - both were fantastic. We will definitely be back!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We loved this place!  Breakfast was delicious!  From the pancakes to the build your own hash  outdoor seating area is awesome.  Kind of hot to sit inside on a hot summer day but if you can snag a seat on the patio you're good!  Such friendly staff, in fact max the manager was so awesome about helping us get a Great table outside! Super nice guy! And Zoe at the register is a sweetheart. If you're in the area it's definitely a place you should stop and eat at."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great brunch in downtown sb. My bf and I both choose build a hash. The poached eggs on salmons is amazing good!! Next time will try the pancake~
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Our experience at Dawn Patrol was in a league of its own! The staff was so friendly and helpful, the music and TV were relaxing, the food was prepared with finesse and care, and there are power outlets to charge your phone at every table! Not only did we try the build your own hash and typical breakfast plate, but also enjoy a latte and some coffee cake. VERY good!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I ordered the ""build-your-own-hash"" with the russet potatoes, sage sausage, veggies & cheese, overeasy eggs topped with herb aioli (toast and salad included) and it was sooo delicious! 

Sitting outside is the better option; the counter to order is indoors and the brief time I was in there it felt so stuffy as if there was no working AC, with a little amount of guests eating in there. However, the outdoor area is tight on space and quite crowded with people. The wait to receive our food took longer than expected."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,The food was ok. Not as good as I hoped. The frittata was tasty but not fantastic. The huevos rancheros was ok as well. The cilantro was not cut properly because the stems were long. My husband had to trim all of the cilantro. Kind of pricey for what you get. $34 with one coke and no sides no bacon etc.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great breakfast spot! Make your own hash was super delicious and healthy, loved my salsa sauce and all the veggies. Loved the music as well."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Delicious! Was afraid of a long wait due to some other reviewers but at 9am-ish on a Sunday we had no wait at all! Loved the huevos rancheros! Yum Yum!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The food was great and they're really dog friendly, which is always nice."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Very tasty! Loved the hash and the vanilla bean latte was AMAZING! Will def be back! I gave this 4 over 5 bc service was a little slow-- it took 15 mins to get waters. This is a solid spot though!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Food was A-Ok. My daughter loved her pancakes. In the a.m. the seating is limited. My husband got a burrito, and although it was okay, it was messy. It was a challenge for him to eat without it going everywhere. I got Huevos Rancheros. I liked mine. The Dark Chocolate Latte was also good. Service was okay. They were busy, brought water when I asked (it was so hot in the morning), they asked if I wanted ice. There isn't a whole lot of service however. What's nice is that you order and pay, sit, and can leave whenever you're done."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Loved this place and sad that I don't live in SB so that I could eat there more!

Service was great and I thought we got our food pretty fast!  In regards to the other comments about the price...yes, it is a bit pricey but I think it is worth it given the ingredients they use and the fact that they make everything from scratch!

The build your own hash was awesome (great bread served with it along with jam made in house).  Pancakes were really good and they squeeze the OJ right there for you.  Will definitely be back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"cool spot but seriously horrible service.

We walked in and saw 2 cooks in the kitchen and no one out front. Then I saw a staff member in one of the booths eating his breakfast and the other staff person sees me, my husband along with a few other people lining up and doesnt even make any effort to walk over adn take orders. I wasn't sure if we had to sit down and have a waitor or place an order with the front register - it was so bizarre. Like they had no sense of urgency or attempting to help or provide service.

Finally when the staff member dragged ass to the front, the people in front of us placed their order. Instead of him getting everyones order he decided to leave the register go and make the smoothe they requested while taking his sweet ass time, then come back and take another order. Slow and obnoxious!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great food, amazing staff, and cute atmosphere.  I loved it.  Would recommend to anyone looking for killer eats at a great price."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Everything was fantastic. From the friendly staff to the wonderful healthy food. I had the frittata which was very tasty and the wife had the grits hash. 
The music is old school which is fun. I know it seems ridiculous but I have to give a thumbs up for the napkins. They are thick and sturdy unlike other places where you have to use four since they just fall apart. 
They also make a good cup of Joe.
We will definitely be back - I wish we were a little closer so that we could come more often but we will for sure be back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Really friendly and helpful staff- very comfortable atmosphere. In town for a family wedding so we had 15 people coming and going with kids and all kinds of things going on and it was absolutely no problem.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I would classify this as a Yelp FAIL.  Honestly, I don't understand how this restaurant was rated so high.  Perhaps tourists who were overly happy about being in Santa Barbara?  We stopped on morning for breakfast.  Food was marginal at best.  Generous portions, organic and gluten free offers, fresh bacon, but the highlights stopped there.  Ambiance was ok.  Pancakes were not great.  Wait time was not worth it, and like most tourist traps certainly overpriced.  I would suggest traveling down State St.  for something else."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Our family had the build your own hash, veggie omelette and the gluten free pancakes.  Maybe I have lived a sheltered life, but this was one of the best breakfasts we have ever had.  The people and service were really cool too"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The build you own Hash was amazing! I had mine with russet potatoes, coned beef, pepper jack cheese, mushrooms and spinach, an egg and bacon gravy it comes with a salad. 
My wife had hers with sweet potato, sausage, spinach, avocado, cheddar, egg and the herb aioli sauce. We also shared the gluten free pancakes that were just as delicious!
I will definitely come here again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,I had the Huevos Rancheros and it was incredible. Although this place is a bit pricey it makes up for a good atmosphere and service. Being on a college student budget I don't recommend for breakfast or lunch but worth it to try once or twice. I'll be back
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,The vanilla latte was good but the food was kind of plain and nothing special especially for the price. Staff was nice but nothing too special about the food
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"On. Monday morning before a UCSB college tour we dined here for a late breakfast. The place is a cheery colorful restaurant, it is great they have outdoor seating option which is what we decided to do.

You order at the counter and get seated and wait for the food to be served. They have a build your own breakfast option which is a great one as you can choose york protein, eggs, carb, fruits and veggies along with the sauce you want over your meal ($14 option).

I got two poached eggs served with veggie patties and a gluten free pancake. All was tasty, prepared perfect and no issues with our order. The only issue was the fact there was no one ahead of us to be served, and we waited about 15 minutes for our meal. Which was a bit too long... 

Staff is friendly and helpful and all together a nice place to dine and take your time to relax."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Passing through town and I found this place on Yelp. Very friendly staff and the food was yummy. I left my wallet in my car and the guy even put my order in so when I got back it was ready and let me pay without standing in line. I also love the wall with the colored wood and the vibe this place has. Will be back if I ever pass through town again!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Was surprised to find Beach Break Cafe gone but pleasantly surprised by this new place. Cool looking decor and very welcoming. Super friendly people. A little pricey but not surprising for SB. Food is good and fresh. A bit slow on service but seems like they are still getting in their groove having just opened. Definitely coming back! And bonus, it's still dog friendly."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Read many positive Yelp reviews and decided to try this place and was not disappointed! Ordered the build your own hash with sweet potato, veggie sausage, eggs over hard, spinach, avocado and herb aioli and it was delicious, and not too greasy. I also got the house made chai tea which was also really good. Will definitely be coming here again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great breakfast and friendly staff.  Not too crowded   We will definitely be back here next visit!  Very happy
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Food is flavorful. Portion size could be a bit more considering the price. $17 for potatoes, a small portion of greens, 1 pc of toast, less than a tsp of jam and a cup of house coffee. Customer service for me wasn't  except-able at all. Walked into the door and was greeted with a eye contact stare with no greeting whatsoever. This was my second time there and definitely my last. The former manager Bree was a good friend and by far the best greeter and customer service person they'll ever have.  Very disappointed"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Another great yelp find! Pretty quick and easy . Walk up ordering. Seat your self style! Was drawn to this place because the reviews of the ""build your own hash

I ordered russet hash, corned beef, avocado , and over easy egg. The food was definitely good. I would rate it over the top! My wife got a Dawn patrol combo and rated it the same. Would come back , would rate it above average overall!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great breakfast spot on State street. Their 3 egg white frittata with spinach, cheeee, potatoes, and avocado was delicious. The huevos rancheros was also very good. For bigger appetites the create your own hash with eggs of your own choice is also a great option. Food and service is all very good. Be sure to try the orange juice. Freshly squeezed and very tasty. Gets crowded so come early."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We chose this place for its ratings, brunch menu, and dog-friendly patio. It's a seat-yourself restaurant, where you order at the counter. We found a table for four easily enough at 9:30 on a Sunday (brunch rush streamed in at 10), and ordered quickly. Even though there weren't that many people, the wait for our food was quite long - about 15 or 20 min. The food itself was good but not outstanding. It's a solid choice for a brunch spot near the beach, though - especially if you have a dog."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Build your own hash for brunch was amazing!  Great little place with outdoor seating and delicious food.  Staff was very friendly too!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"If I were to rate this based also on how long it took for my food to come, it would only be 1 star.  So I will pretend the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Meh.  I don't understand the high reviews.  I usually trust the yelp averages, but this one is wrong.  Average food. But somehow seems quite popular."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Friendly staff, good food and reasonable prices. Building your own combo (called Hash) is fun and makes sure you really like what you eat."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Visiting Santa Barbara today and stopped by for brunch. Phenomenal! Ecerything is truly home made. Best buttermilk pancakes I've had in a while. The hash browns are a big deal. Don't miss them if you come here. So good!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Ate here for the first time this morning and I WILL be going back. Started with a Madagascar vanilla bean latte (omg the espresso they used was INSANELY good), then ordered a huge breakfast for myself, husband and two kids. 2 short stack pancakes for the kids: huge and delicious. My 4-year old, SUPER picky eater scarfed them down! Croque Madame: eggs perfectly cooked, huge sandwich with yummy ham and what seemed to be home made bread. Gluten free pancakes: delicious and filling with LOADS of fresh, juicy berries on top. Pump smoothie: super yummy and unique smoothie, shared with the kids and they loved it. Overall this place was HIGH CLASS, decor was rich and every detail chosen with care and a discerning eye. Staff was friendly and outgoing. Really hope to see the community embrace this awesome new business."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Nice place off State Street that was great for a fresh but hearty breakfast. Friendly staff that was helpful at explaining the menu to us. They had build your own hashes which was awesome. They also had plenty of other options. This is a go up and order then the serve the food to you at your table, so don't expect breakfast house style. 

We all ordered coffee that came in big cups and was a great roast. For breakfast, I got a salmon hash with potatoes, spinach, poached eggs, and aioli sauce. It was deliciousness! My husband loved his corned beef with potatoes, mushrooms, hollandaise hash that he created and my dad really liked the white egg omelet that came with avocado and a side of berries. We would come back for sure if we lived there or if we travel down again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Wow wow wow this was my second time coming to dawn patrol and might I say the first I wasn't disappointed and northern was I this time around I had eggs Benedict on top of ham and wheat bread it was delicious!! My spouse had the huevo ranchero (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) anyway it was amazing!!! I wanted to help her eat it but I know I had my own dish lol! Anyway if your ever Dwntwn SB before 2:00 please give them a try!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Delicious! Great place to have breakfast. ""Build your own hash"" is the seller here! I had a hash with chicken, bacon, cheese, tomato, avocado and fire roasted salsa and it was as good as it sounds. Also shared some french toast which was very good. The service was also very good. Friendly staff and clean place.  Will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Santa Barbara."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,These folks know what they're doing. Generous portions splendidly prepared. This is one of the best breakfast places in town!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We really like this place, great coffee, hashes and other breakfast options and a great value."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I was immensely impressed by Dawn Patrol. The service was spectacular, the manager was hands-on ensuring that everything was awesome, and even let me order off-menu. Most importantly, the food was awesome. 

The three eggwhite frittata was surprisingly tasty. The breakfast potatoes are cooked into the eggs, which gave it some nice heft and texture, and the veggies were clearly fresh and cared for. Served with a 'seeded avocado,' which was really a revelation - this was a perfectly scooped avocado that was essentially rolled in 'everything' mixture (eg Trader Joe's), adding a wonderful texture and flavor to the avo. The oatmeal was out of this world, with apricots and honey, and the breakfast burrito was a yummy mess. Also, the manager allowed me to order a side of the house-cured lox, which were prepared with pickled red onion and comparable to any lox I've had in L.A., NY or otherwise.

Sit outside if you can, but wherever you'll sit it's going to be awesome. What a treat."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Absolutely delicious and better health conscience options on the menu like the yummy gluten free pancakes with fresh fruit and almonds.  The hash combos are also absolutely delicious!  Great outdoor eating area as well
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We were so happy to find this place! We arrived before 9 a.m.  On a Sunday - so we were able to order quickly AND snag a table. Great breakfast choices - we had delicious huevos rancheros, homemade strawberry scone, scrambled eggs and perfect coffee. Counter service only, but very friendly. Would definitely go here  again!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great food!  Nutritious and healthy breakfast hash. Clearly popular as the line to order was always at least a few people deep. Order at the counter then find a table and a busser will bring you your meal.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Although the staff was friendly, the food left something to be desired. I ordered one of the hashes with the corned beef and was disappointed to find that the beef was cooked in spices that tasted like allspice, not something I was expecting to find in my breakfast hash. The taste totally overpowered everything else on the plate. Knowing that I just hate that flavor, I gave the plate to my partner for eating, who can sometimes be a human garbage can. He thought it was inedible too, sadly. 

I ordered gravy on the side to taste and was similarly overpowered by the amount of pepper in the sauce. 

Last check against the breakfast was that the salad had balsamic vinegar on it, which I was not expecting on a breakfast plate with the other flavors in the hash. It was sort of strange and misplaced. 

It was an unhappy circumstance of being all of the flavors I hate the most combined with the cost of the meal (definitely not inexpensive). The portion was huge to give them credit but sort of inedible."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Driving down form SJ we stopped here for breakfast. It was absolutely delicious. The service was wonderful. Will definitely come again.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I don't eat out often because of numerous food restrictions, so this was an exciting find. The build-a-hash was delicious! Good for gluten free, Paleo or even AIP peeps."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Visiting SB and was looking for a healthier breakfast option that worked for our whole family. Dawn Patrol was great as everyone was happy with their food choices. Service was quick and very nice and accommodating. We would come back again.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Think Santa Barbara vibe with San Francisco food.

There is usually a bit of a wait (don't be surprised if you have to wait about 30 min for your food on a weekend), but it's well worth it!  One of the best breakfasts in Santa Barbara.  Fresh and creative.  Try the hash - build it the way you like.  Don't forget to add avocado."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Waited 20 minutes in line before someone came out and told us that once we order it would be at least another 30 minutes to get our food, regardless of what we order.

Meanwhile, people behind me are grabbing tables before ordering while I'm waiting to order before my party grabs our table, because that's how it's supposed to work.

By the time I get to the counter they're already out of the thing I wanted, at 10:30am on a Saturday. I ask the guy how seating is supposed to work and he confirms you're supposed to order first but doesn't seem to care that the 2 people behind me just took a booth that can seat 6 people.

Bullshit experience, and the food is mediocre as fuck, especially given the wait."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I can't eat eggs, so breakfast is not my meal of choice to eat, however, I had a great experience at Dawn Patrol. I love the way it is decorated, great colors, very bright and vibrant.

The menu: I was won over by the Gluten Free pancakes. It made my day. They were delicious. I tried someone's bacon and it was delicious. The potatoes were great. I had a side of lox, those were ok, not my favorite item on our table. 

I ordered a delicious iced coffee and when the server brought the coffee I asked for Coconut Milk and he gladly brought me some from the back. They have an area where you can cream and sugar your coffee and I was happy to get it for the rest of my group, btu the server went out of his way to bring us half and half and sugar, I really thought that was nice of him.

As I mentioned before, I am not a breakfast person, but this spot was great and I definitely recommend it."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Nice coffee joint with some food options available. Getting a seat may be difficult depending on when you go, there is usually a fair number of people sitting and studying/working throughout the day."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The service was amazing. They were able to accommodate our huge group without any notice. They provided us with everything that we needed without any hesitation. Highly recommend this place, and the food was delicious!!!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We are from the LA area and drove up the 101 fwy as we headed to our Spartan Super.  We were looking to eat breakfast where healthy eating was a priority (egg whites, wheat, etc).  We found Dawn Patrol and decided to stop.  Boy, was I happy we did!!  If you don't care about quality food and you're more concerned about price - this place isn't for you.  I absolutely loved the quality, the taste, and the service.  The restrooms were clean, but it was only 8am when we arrived.  The coffee, the fresh squeezed OJ, the veggie sausage, egg whites, and sweet potatoes!  It was heaven for me!  I will definitely return if I'm in the area again!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"As someone who is not really a fan of breakfast foods (don't eat eggs and bacon or sausage), I loved this place.  I had their build-a-hash with veggies and vegetarian sausage, as well as the Hawaiian French Toast.  The place itself was fairly busy but still relaxed."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Maybe the worst breakfast experience Ive had in the last 20 years in Santa Barbara.
My breakfast was served cold? Yes brought back warm with a tasteless chicken and odd green sauce topping. Way below standard for breakfast in SB.Lets hope they up their game or the won't last long."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great custom skillet like breakfasts.  I had the potatoes with corned beef and all the toppings.  It was excellent.  Their soy cappuccino was superb! We got lucky and there was no line but a minute later there was a line out the door.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great breakfast place. We went on a Sunday and there was a line but I thought the food arrived in a decent amount of time. Staff was very friendly.   They have indoor and outdoor seating.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Their make your own hash option is great and they have some really good gluten free pancakes.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Sunday around noon was busy. Very long wait to order and food took awhile to come out. Employees are friendly and work hard. Food was tasty but eggs and toast weren't hot. Almost cold, but the flavor made up for it. Bacon is thick and tasty. Homemade wheat bread was tasty with the jam. Potatoes were delish, but they only gave me three with the ""patrol combo"". Drip coffee hot and decent. Inside the restaurant it is kinda warm and stuffy. This was my second visit here and I would come again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Best eggs Benedict I've had....and I've had quite a few. Coffee hot and delicious - definitely worth the wait!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Decided to try this place and I was excited after reading the menu online. I LOVED the restaurant that was here before and my favorite thing to order was the corned beef hash. Seeing that this was a place for hash I expected more from the traditional corned beef hash I ordered here. The flavor was off and the beef was seriously like eating rubber! The potatoes were mushy... it was just a let down They also served my hash along with a giant bed of mixed greens tossed with a vinaigrette and nothing else at all. Salad and breakfast? I don't think of those together and it didn't say it came with salad on the menu. It was 13$ and not worth that much!!! Not only that but since you order and pay at the front you have to tip on their iPad, it was either no tip, 15%, 18% 20%. I wasn't going to leave NO Tip, but I definitely didn't want to leave a 15% tip to order up at the register, I mean c'mon thats just stupid, they don't even have to refill your waters because they give you a glass bottle to pour your own which is totally fine and less wasteful but the staff literally does nothing. Any way- the whole vibe does not mesh well. Its like a surfer joint gone hipster and their ""table numbers"" were hula bobble girls with a giant emoji attached to them? WHAT?. The whole experience was just weird and a bummer. Im sure they have some other good food but I definitely won't be back to find out. The local vibe is totally gone...."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Don't be fooled by the good reviews and avoid this place!!

Service isn't bad but man, nothing can make up for bad food and 40 minutes to wait for your dish.

I went here around 11:20am. There were maybe 3 people in front of us in line and an empty table outside. This should mean they weren't too slammed. 
We got a coffee, chorizo hash dish and a breakfast burrito. Btw, I thought a breakfast burrito for $11 was pretty high even measuring against LA price which is where I live.
We paid at 11:23am exactly because I got an email receipt. 
We asked for 2 cups of water and the cashier told us that the server would bring it with utensils. 
20 minutes later, we still didn't have any water, utensils, whatsoever.
It was 12:01pm when we were served food. I'm not joking because I took a picture when the food came out. 
It wasn't just us either. A couple other tables that sat around the same time we got there all had to wait 40min to get their food. 
We went to this place because we wanted to grab a quick bite instead of having a sit down breakfast/brunch. 
When my food came out, it wasn't even made right and I had to ask them to remake it which added another 10minutes to actually eat my food. 
I don't know if they were completely understaffed or what but I was so angry and very close to ask for a full refund and just leave.
If the food tasted fine, it might have made up for the ridiculous wait but my breakfast burrito tasted like something I could make at home. (I'm really not a good cook at all.)
You have no idea how angry I was. It really took me a couple hours to feel better."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"5 stars food and service! What a cute place to come for brunch! The decor is on point making you feel right at home and giving you great new ideas on how to decorate your own living room haha. Overall we got the build your own hash and mimosas and they both did the trick! There is a variety of options for the hash and the mimosas are well balanced! Would definitely come here again. The only downside is the price, but I got to say that its well worth the trip and money. Great date place on state street if you wanna impress your significant other (thats what I did ;) Oh and don't worry about parking we easily found street parking for 75 minutes free (around noon on a Friday)."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Food was good a little pricey in my opinion, but the quality was good. Been living in SB for a while and never noticed this place because of its ""hidden"" location next to Casablanca. My wife and I agreed that our favorite part of our experience was the service. Servers were very kind and attentive. The restaurant was also very clean and had a great vibe.

We will definitely visit again!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Better than a regular diner. But the food is meh. Ordered hash, pancake and eggs. The hash had roasted sweet potatoes instead of rosette potatoes. That was still not the main issue. The main problem was that the entire hash dish was so wet and unpalatable. I ended up eating only the salad on the side."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I wanted to love this place... I really did. This place has a HUGE potential to be great but the WAIT FOR YOUR FOOD is a bit ridiculous. Dawn Patrol has a great concept going; the idea of building your own hash. It's very unique and modern, definitely marketed for the ""brunch"" crowd. But the absolute long wait for some potatoes and eggs is insane. The poor table next to us, a group of girls, only one person got their food, while the other women waited another 30 mins to get theres. By the time they did, she was already finished with her whole plate. Come on guys, i don't know what's going on in that kitchen but you guys need a team meeting and re-focus yourselves."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The breakfast hash was was Damn good. I got the potato with veggie sausage and salsa.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Good food. I'm not a big fan of sweet cornbeef and theirs is on the sweet side but I still enjoyed the make your own hash breakfast and that you could go Paleo. Good coffee, fresh OJ, made a table for us since it was packed. All in all nice people, good food, great spot on state but service was slow. They seemed a little overwhelmed even though they had sufficient staff. Also side note, the bathrooms were clean (huge plus to me) you can have 6 star food but a gross bathroom kills it. And they had old skateboard deck pieces as tile work on the bathroom walls. I want it in my bathroom ha! cool as shizy"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,This place is extremely extremely slow. Waited almost an hour to get our food. When you come here expect to wait in line to order and then to wait almost an hour to get your food. We didn't order anything complicated. Not sure why it took so long. They have to look into why it takes so long to get food out. Will not be returning.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fantastic breakfast spot, food is amazing can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Menu is more of a fancy breakfast so be warned, but it tastes amazing. Service is quality, staff is attentive and does a fantastic job. If you are in the area for breakfasts you definitely should stop by this spot."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I've had the Chorizo Hash special two times here. It's delicious! And their cappucino was very yummy, too!

Because people love this place, the wait can feel foreverrrrr, and sometimes seating is hard to find. Just know what you're getting into, and you won't be disappointed!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"An amazing breakfast, everything was top quality and made with great care. The line and wait is long, just be aware. It is also worth the it. Get the fresh squeezed OJ."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Solid brunch place. Have fresh squeezed orange juice is a plus, and it does tastes good. However, their food (especially salad/fruit) is not that fresh."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"This is a nice breakfast spot that just opened a few weeks ago.  Husband's hash was tasty.  He picked sweet potato hash with bacon, mushroom, and cheddar, topped with two perfectly poached eggs and buttery hollandaise sauce.  I wasn't too happy with my choice and wished I had gone with the hash.  The prisoner's egg muffin was Dawn Patrol's take on the rebel within.  A soft boil egg baked inside a savory muffin.  Its one of those dish that requires very precise cooking time so the muffin is done while the egg yolk remains runny.  Unfortunately, the egg was a little overdone as part of the yolk was set.  In addition, it was baked ahead of the time and given the nature of this muffin, it can't be reheated, so it was also served cold.  The accompany salad was drenched in lemon juice and unpalatable.  The side of sausage was pretty skimpy too.  It was $4 for one sausage patty.  Service was friendly, but the servers were inexperienced and awkward.  This place still needs some tweaking, but I would go there for the customizable hash."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Ambiance: casual,beachy, out door seating ,order at the cash register, find your own seat, get your own water...however the food is not typical for these scene
Service: friendly
Food: Fresh, homemade & tasty, freshly squeezed orange juice is given thumbs up by my son who doesn't like orange juice
Price: $80 for breakfast for family 5 a bit pricier than expected."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"A++ eggs benedict, oh my goodness. The mocha was alright, but clearly Dawn Patrol is not a coffee snob locale.
A word to the wise: if you're in SB on a holiday weekend and are looking to breakfast, GO EARLY. My god, the crowds!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Love this little place. Excellent food and excellent service. Everything has a fresh made to order homemade flare along with some unique gourmet style plates to choose from. I got the make it your own hash and eggs and so did my wife. You pick the ingredients. Great idea and delicious! The homemade seeded bread was seriously excellent. I wish I could buy a loaf! A+ all around
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Very good vegan options.  The coffee and service is amazing!!  The only negative I had was that you order at the counter and have to go to the station to doctor your coffee.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,There was a huge line when we got there and it was fully worth it. Had the most amazing fritatta and buttermilk pancake so far. Will def. go back again!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I was in Santa Barbara. Ca.  3/17, 3/18.  Looking for a place to eat breakfast.  After paying $70 for breakfast at the Hyatt Santa Barbara for 2 seniors & 1 child, I was looking for place that was reasonable in price.  I searched yelp and found Dawn Patrol.  Price was great, My vegetable omelet was out of this world, the service was great.  They were all so attentive.  I would come here when I in Santa Barbara anytime.  Thank you Dawn Patrol, you deserve a 5 star rating."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Ordered a breakfast burrito and their specials chorizo hash. Their food was just okay, nothing special, but if I go again I'll have to try the build-your-own hash because it looks way better than what I had. You order up front and there's a self serve station for water and utensils!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I found myself in Santa Barbara one rainy weekend in January 2017.  On the way out of town to drive south back to L.A., a friend and I needed a delicious place to chow down on some brunch-ish type food.  

A quick yelp search turned up this cool retro-feelin' place.  Perfect.

The only downside is that it's so crowded at peak brunch time that you might have to stand & hold your coffee while you stalk some tables.  The upside is that the food is just what the doctor ordered.  The ambience just adds to that happy feeling you're looking for on a Sunday afternoon.  Highly recommended for brunch in S.B.!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Santa Barbara is a wonderful beach town with great food. Dawn Patrol is in a nice location downtown and close to the water. 
Just a heads up -- it's right before the bridge and next to Casa Blanca. The cashier told us to park in the REI parking lot, to avoid ticketing or towing. 

The ambiance is great and it's got sandwiches, burgers, an array of salads and delicious breakfast options. 

I ordered the Cured Salmon and my fiancée ordered the Patrol Burger. 

Cured Salmon is great with the toast and also the sauce that comes with it. I wish the sauce had a little more Dill in it to bring the kick, but still delicious. If you're a Cured Salmon fan -- go for it. 

The Patrol burger is nice and juicy. It comes with a good amount of meat, so it's worth the price. 

Definitely a great spot."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Been coming to Beachbreak Cafe for years and was surprised to see it gone and in its place Dawn Patrol.

Food was very good - wife and kids ordered the pancakes and I the create-it-yourself hash. The corn grits and country gravy were both homemade and quite good.

It's nice to get out of the hotel and go someplace frequented by locals.

I give Dawn Patrol 3 1/2 stars."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"My fiancé and I were in Santa Barbara just for a couple of days and stumbled upon Dawn Patrol through Yelp. We were not let down at all! We both got the build your own hash and it was by far the best breakfast we have ever had. Although, the wait for food was long (we came during their rush) it was definitely worth it. The ingredients used are so fresh and portions are great! We're going to have to make the trek back to Santa Barbara just for Dawn Patrol."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Cool place. Really yummy hash. Order came with a ton of food, could have easily split. Servers were friendly and helpful. They even made a luke warm version of their hot chocolate for our toddlers."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Nice, fresh breakfast in Santa Barbara. Prices are up there but the portions are large which make up for it. Egg white frittata had nice flavor and strawberries were fresh and sweet."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great food, fun space. Love the build your own hash breakfast. The home baked breads are delicious and the blueberry scone is yummy. 

Wish the coffee was better, and the music could use some help, but regardless - it's a great addition to the breakfast scene here in SB. Quickly becoming a favorite!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The point: good food, small portions

I had the Patrol Combo with the sausage and cheddar scone. I loved the sausage and the scone! So yummy. The potatoes were underdone and disappointing. My boyfriend had the Luau French Toast. This was amazing-- especially the pineapple cream something-or-other. I couldn't help but feel like the portions for my combo meal were kind of small. The plate looked bare and sort of pathetic."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. I came with a group of four and we each ordered and paid separately but all for the same table. All our food came out in a different order and definitely not at the same time. About 15 minutes after ordering, two of our plates came and one more 15 mins later. I ended up waiting about 45 minutes for my food to be delivered while the rest of my table had all their food. I probably would have had time to walk somewhere else, get takeout, come back and still be waiting for my order. I watched as whole groups that had come in after us got their food and left. We asked the servers several times when we the rest of us were getting our food and they just kept saying it was ""on its way"" and didn't seem to be in a hurry at all. Food was decent, but because it was served at completely different times and out of order I will not be coming back here. I expected to wait awhile for my food, but definitely not almost an hour and at least expected to have it all given to us at the same time."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Quality,hearty and delicious. I've dropped by several times for the hash combos. Coffee is high quality."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great breakfast spot off State Street that was close to where we were staying in the Funk Zone. You order at the counter and then grab a seat. Our food took a while to come out but it was worth the wait. We ordered the egg white frittata and the chorizo hash which were both equally great; however, the real show stopper was my iced vanilla latte. We'll definitely come back next time we're in town."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This was some of the best brunch we ever had. The line seemed long and intimidating at first, but once we ordered, the food came fairly quickly. The vanilla bean latte was so delicious (albeit, I was starving), and the hash was hearty and healthy, leaving me with a happy tummy and not overly stuffed like I am a lot of times post-brunch. Wish I lived in SB just to go back to this place!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great breakfast!  Walk up order and pay. Then your food is delivered to your table. Bacon was smoked I believe and it was thick cut. Very tasty. The scone was amazing!  Scones can go either way and can be dry this was perfect texture!  We also had a chorizo hash dish. Huge! Lots of flavor. Oh and the cappuccino was delicious!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Waited 40 minutes for a hash and a burger. Manager compensated us with a cup of coffee and a piece of stale flavorless coffee cake. When our food came, my toast was cold and hard (the pea size dollop of butter they gave me didn't even melt); the herbed aioli  for the hash was gross - thankfully I got it on the side; ordered the burger medium and it came rare - too rare to eat in the middle. The only positives were it's dog friendly, hash wasn't bad, and they refunded the cost of the burger."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"love this little spot on state street! I went for breakfast & was very pleased. I had a breakfast build a hash bowl where you choose your meat & all the other goodies. I chose salmon with sweet potatoes,avocad, poached egg & smothered it in hollandaise sauce, YUM! they also have gluten free options. MUS"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"O gosh, the best chorizo hash special I think I have ever had full of robust flavor and cooked perfectly, the said salsa was just perfect and half of avocado on top.  Great for two to share."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The atmosphere here is great and the food is delicious. The dishes are simple but done so well. Amazing flavors!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The build your own hash is delicious! My boyfriend and I got there around 8 am (yay jet lag !) and the place was pretty empty. The guy at the counter was very friendly. We both got the build your own hash and it lived up to the hype! The vanilla bean latte was phenomenal! Everything is customizable and can be made to fit in with any diet or food preference!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Make your own hash is just brilliant! How could you not give it five stars if you are the one designing your breakfast! Service was fast and super friendly and the coffee very good. Eat inside or out. Just wonderful!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"5 PLUS STARS for the excellent service. Food was great. Location is convenient. Theme is funky and fun. Great outdoor dining, excellent selections too."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"First time coming and the good yelp reviews persuaded us to take the walk. Must say this place is awesome. Food is very well made, savory and has good presentation. Staff is very welcoming as well. So many choices but the must try at least once is the build your own hash. Literally pick what potatoes, protein and veggies and cheese. It tastes fresh and made w TLC. Thumbs up guys! I will make this my come back place when in SB moving forward. Note: I came on a Monday so I didn't deal w any breakfast rush. Not sure about weekends."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Take your favorite breakfast joint and make it with fresher ingredients, home-baked bread, and tons of fun options-- you've got Dawn Patrol."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The food was very delicious!! I had the build your own hash. The quality was good and so were the portions. My whole family went and service was fast and friendly. I was very impressed with the place. Definitely check it out!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Amazing unique breakfast. Coffee is off the hook. The GM and staff are awesome! Great, laid back atmosphere right off of State Street and the beach!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"My wife and I both ordered huevos ranchos--beautiful presentation and delicious--my wife said best huevos ranchos she ever had. I wouldn't quite go that that far but I would say excellent, especially for a place that doesn't specialize in mexican food."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"These breakfasts were expertly prepared : just the right temperature and a great blend of sweet, salty and tart.

Pleasant outdoor seating and cheerful staff, who poured me a coffee as I ordered!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Nice service, nice atmosphere, great coffee, fabulous food. Very young crowd. Kid-friendly. Counter service, great menu including lots of breakfast staples, kids options, and make your own hash. I ordered the hash with sweet potato and peppers, sage sausage, spinach, tomatoes, scrambled eggs and herb aioli. My husband ordered the huevos rancheros. Both were delicious. My picky son ordered the kids grilled cheese and it was a hit. Homemade OJ was excellent. Park in the lot across the street. Great spot in SB."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Came here for brunch. Got the Build-a-hash with sweet potatoes peppers and onions, corned beef, mushroom, cheddar and pepper jack cheese all on scrambled eggs with hollandaise sauce. Also got the Madagascar Vanilla bean latte. The food was good! The sweet potatoes are just the right amount of doneness that it's not too mushy! And the corned beef was tender. I would have wanted a bit more cheese though. They came with toast and mixed greens. Not sure what kind of dressing they had with the mixed greens but it was great! The vanilla bean latte was a little too sweet for me though. Overall I would definitely come back here for breakfast."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"My sister and I rode our bikes from marina del Rey to Santa Barbara for a nice getaway and found this AMAZING spot for breakfast! The staff there was incredibly nice and accommodating for our situation. Besides the delicious food and fresh squeezed oh, their hospitality was through the roof! They will forever be our choice for breakfast/lunch every future trip to SB! Thanks guys!!! :) catch ya next time!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Hash is amazing and I love how you can create your own with so many options. Coffee tasted a little funky is my only complaint. Just seemed kinda weird flavor. Food wise, place is excellent. Would definitely eat there again when visiting SB."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Food and the service is great. Been living in SB for a while and never noticed this place because of its ""hidden"" location next to Casablanca. My wife and I agreed that our favorite part of our experience was the service. Servers were very kind and attentive. The restaurant was also very clean and had a great vibe.

We will definitely visit again!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Today we came here to eat. The orders got mixed up and the manager took great care of us and helped to fix our problem in a very professional way. The review is for the wonderful customer service but also we all got custom hash orders and it was really amazing. 
Good quality, fresh delicious food. We will most definitely return!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I enjoyed my food here and the staff was very friendly! Great location and lots of good seating. Breakfast lovers should check it out. Took off a start because the food took about 20 minutes to come out - it's an order at the counter restaurant and I felt that this was a pretty long ticket time. Yummy food though, so if you aren't in a rush it's a great breakfast option."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Breakfast was great! Orange juice was freshly squeezed. Vibe is relaxed and the service was on point. We opted for the standard breakfast, Benedict and corn beef hash. The purpose for the visit was the Hawaiian French toast but they were out of bread."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I was very excited to try this place, but after having breakfast there, I would say it is way overrated. It would have been great if I can taste the coffee when drinking their cappuccinos, not just tons of milk. :("
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Good stuff.  Try the corned beef hash.  Friendly staff.  Monster coffee cups.  All's fresh.  Yeehaw!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We just ate brunch at Dawn Patrol on State street. We stumbled on this place walking to the beach, they have Fresh baked huckleberry scones  it was amaging!!!!
My husband had the build your Own hash with Salmon ruset potato veggies poached eggs onions and salsa. i had the chicken hash One of the best hash i've ever had. Organic cooffee was very strong but good. Really cool bathrooms made out of recycled skate boards. great vibe."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Best corned beef hash in Santa Barbara. Hands DOWN!  They use real meat pieces slowly cooked and fresh seasoning, not out of a can either!  Good qty for the price tag too."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Ok, seriously the best breakfast EVER! This was the very last stop on our road trip and I wish it was our first because we would have made a special trip to stop on our way home. The staff was great. My daughter wanted to hold the hawaiian girl table marker and they let her choose her own, then brought another one with our food. Happy toddler, happy parents and other patrons! No wait to sit and we had a great table outside on the patio. The ambiance is so quaint yet eclectic. Great coffee choices and the food was amazing. My husband had the Build your own Hash and it was so GOOD!! My daughter shared the gluten free pancakes with me and the fresh berries were more than fresh! I wish there was a Dawn Patrol in my neck of the woods. It would be my #1 place! I cannot wait to go back!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great breakfast, very fulfilling.
The service is great, very quick and the food is very fresh. Its a hipster place in a good area of SB.
I highly recommend them!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Always super slow. Slow to take orders, slow to get the food out. I've never understood the hype. Food is decent tho. Pretty standard quality and pricing for the area."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We come up to watch our son on the mens volleyball team at UCSB. Tried this place out for something new. Well, it's now going to be a staple for breakfast when we're in town. My wife is Gluten intolerant for real and had many choices. I'll eat anything.  All was delicious. I highly recommend the place."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Stopped by here on the way up to wine country and this place did not disappoint! It's an order-at-the-counter type place and they are known for their make-your-own hashs (and for good reason).  I would account for some time in line (we somehow made it right before the rush) but the line on a Saturday morning was out the door.

They are completely customizable so you can choose your meat, your veggies, sauces, etc ($12.50).  I ended up with the standard potato hash with corned beef, all veggies, over easy eggs, and the country gravy.  All delicious, and very filling for the cost.  My only complaint (although not a huge complaint) was that I got an orange juice that ended up costing $7.  I mean, it was really delicious, but a little expensive as it was over half the cost of my meal alone.  Besides the hash, other people got the grilled cheese which was very unique as it had apricot harissa.  It added a unique flavor, with the classicness that is still grilled cheese.  I'd come back if I'm in the area in the future!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Loved it ! Amazing food and loved the Luau French Toast ! The servers are very friendly and welcoming. I would defend recommend ! Love the our door seating and the fresh orange juice is amazing ! If you are in town definitely try it !
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"First time here, we were looking for a nice fashion restaurant with traditional breakfast and nice prices, mi wife found this restaurant within walking distance and here we are, definitly nice place, good food and nice service., I had huevos rancheros, very original and tasty..., we definitly coming back..!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Had the chorizo hash special, was truly delicious. Mimosa's where really good as well. Staff was very friendly and came over to ask about us multiple times. Highly recommend."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,New favorite breakfast spot in Santa Barbara. The build your own hash is exactly what I've been looking for - a healthy breakfast option that isn't made of bagels or bread. Their veggies are always super fresh and the green salad is a nice unique touch! Coffee is good too.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great breakfast - probably one of the best in Santa Barbara. We walked over fairly early and coincidentally ran into our friends who were also checking it out.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great food, coffee and the customer service was five star. These guys go above and beyond to make sure your breakfast is as delicious and relaxing as possible. The restaurant is spacious, lots of tables and a nice big patio. And spotless. We got there just in time to get a nice little two seater outside.

I ordered the aloha French toast, and a freshly squeezed orange juice for my son,  a big cup of coffee and the egg white frittata (made with regular eggs not the egg whites. I'm lucky, don't have to worry about cholesterol). Anyway for some reason the French toast, and OJ got left off my order. My frittata arrived and we waited a little while and then a little longer still no French toast. I went up and let the guys know and within just a couple of minutes we had both. They were super friendly, very helpful, never seemed annoyed even though they were getting slammed at the time.True professionals. 

The food was outstanding. My frittata was so good perfectly cooked yummy eggs just the right amount of cheese beautiful fresh sweet strawberries and BlackBerries on the side and the presentation was lovely. My coffee was great. My son's French toast was thoroughly enjoyed, and the orange juicewas so fresh and the color so bright and almost didn't look real.

We will definitely be back, thank you Dawn patrol for such a wonderful breakfast"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Unbelievably slow service. 1 person taking orders, stood in line to order for an hour. This is not the place to go if you want a faster breakfast. Many pissed off people standing in line. We watched a number of people get out of line and go to the Mexican restaurant next door. 3 stars because food was good, but not worth the wait. Plenty of other places in the area to pick from before I would head back here."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I thought it was okay, wasn't disappointed but coming back? I don't know.  For a place known for its hash maybe I should have gotten that instead but I went for a breakfast burrito instead. You know it was okay, nothing super spectacular and I should have gone with a non vegetarian option as well. 

It's trying to be kind of casual and easygoing with the ordering system but the line can be long and having to order then find a table can be a little nerve wracking. Since there's usually such a rush to get a table sometimes you'll have to get one that's not cleared or wiped down yet."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Enjoyed the cool modern surfer design and ambiance. Fresh and delicious lunch! I had a chicken salad with farmers market lettuce with perfectly cooked bacon and chicken. We also had the chicken sandwich on freshly baked focaccia with pepper jack cheese. Price is fair for the high quality food and service. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this place!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The service, food and ambiance is great. The French toast was yummy and light - not too heavy! I loved it.  Everyone was very friendly."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Yum! Sounds like I should have had the Build Your Own Hash next time! This time, the breakfast burrito was insane. We ordered two and had to take one to go because they were so big! A little weird for me to have beans in a breakfast burrito, but it worked really well. And I love the decor. The last place there had great food, but I always felt the place was dirty - especially the bathrooms. This place was clean and vibrant! And the staff was super nice and helpful! I will go back regularly!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Loved it here! The breakfast was great and the customer service was awesome. I also enjoyed listening to the music they were playing ;)
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Pretty neat little place. Good good. Difficult to find if following google maps. Pancakes were pretty unique. Yummy. Eggs were great. Only had soda in the bottle. We sat in a booth by the coffee and the guy kept pounding everything while making coffee and it took away from the vibe otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. I'd go back but not sit there!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great quick and healthy breakfast, average prices for the area. I had the build your own hash with sweet potatoes, bacon, over medium eggs and the herb aioli (I didn't love this and asked for a side of the fire roasted salsa which was great) and the homemade sourdough wheat toast which was delicious. The toast is served with a lemon butter and strawberry jam and was an interesting combo."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Solid solid solid, everything it's reviewed to be. Don't miss this spot. Amazing grub, coffee etc. really terrific experience."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"A+++
Hands down the best brunch we had in Santa Barbara. Everything we ordered was delicious and the flavors were on point. The wait was long but the food made it worth the wait. The staff was welcoming and the atmosphere was relaxed. We picked the make your own hash option with potatoes, salmon, veggies and egg benedict smothered with hollandaise and the Hawaiian french toast and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Will definitely return whenever I am in Santa Barbara."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Build a hash has me feeling some type of way. Best breakfast brunch place on state street
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Love this brunch spot! Amazing food ! Only issues where with the slowish service. Will return for sure.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Very delicious make your own hash in Santa Barbara! Everything was fresh and delicious. Get there early as the line can tend to get long!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Tasty options if you are vegetarian! 
Our family ordered the egg white frittata, luau French toast, and a build your hash with veggie sausage . All tasted amazing. If you build your own hash, top it with the herb aioli! 

We found a new spot to eat at when passing through SB!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great spot for breakfast. Make your own Hash was delicious! A little pricey, I wish they didnt charge extra for avocado. Sat out on the patio which had a nice ambiance. Friendly staff, cute decor. Would recommend"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Great customer service, food was ok I had the ""Breakfast Sando"" and asked for potatoes instead of the salad, potatoes were great but the sandwich itself wasn't"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,i love coming here ! my boyfriend and i usually come on weekdays so it's never crowed and we don't wait longer than 10 min for our food to arrive. the atmosphere is incredibly cute! the restaurant itself looks clean. my boyfriend always loves what he orders (usually build your own hash). and i absolutely LOVE their huevos rancheros. it's not too expensive but is a little on the pricey side BUT it is santa barbara state st so that's expected and the food makes it all worth it! the food taste fresh and healthy even! we love coming here !
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is a no frills, totally laid back restaurant with the best food. The decor is surf boards cut into tiles and put on the walls of the bathroom, to wood planked walls  painted all the colors of  the rainbow in the dining area. Big on taste when it comes to flavors and the prices are outstanding. My sista and I shared a plate they gave us so much. We had the Chorizo Hash Special, a mix of egg, potato, chorizo, onion and bell pepper mixed together and topped with cheese and Avacodo. Included with the dish was corn tortillas, black beans and salsa. A must visit if your in Santa Barbara or traveling through off the 101 fwy."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I really liked this place.  The concept and food are great.  The line was a little long so we took the advice of Megan J. and had someone get a table for our group of six.  Once ordered the food did not take too long.  The fresh orange juice is squeezed in front of you.  Coffee was decent.  Had the hash with tomatoes, spinach, pepper jack, eggs over easy and hollandaise sauce.  Everyone's meal looked good and everyone enjoyed it!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,New favorite breakfast spot in SB. Great vegetarian and healthy options too! Egg white frittata rocks!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Really cool breakfast spot in downtown Santa Barbara. I loved my breakfast bowl full of potatoes and eggs and southwestern flavors.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Friendly service, very helpful. The food was amazing - fresh, delicious, creative ! Highly recommend any of the hashes. The coffee was the best we've had in Santa Barbara!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"This place is over priced for average tasting food. They won't make a combo with adding eggs and bacon so you're forced to buy another entree. It was $45 for 2 orders of French toast, Eggs/bacon, and 1 coffee."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Only go here if you have an hour to wait for your food. We got halfway through placing our order and the cashier let us know that the wait time for our food to leave the counter and be served to our table was going to be about 40-45 minutes. I appreciated the warning but it made it slightly awkward to back out of the order, so we stayed. The service was good (courteous to warn us of the wait). Food was average for the Santa Barbara area. I don't think we will go back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"A comfortable cheery shop with a small interesting menu uniquely done. The atmosphere is friendly and beachy. Casual in that you order standing at the front counter, yet seating is comfortable and inviting enough to stay a while. A little bit of table service while you're there. 

A couple of meal notes:
OJ - squeezed on site with a funky cut-and-squeeze by the glass machine. Super fresh. 
Tea - several loose leef selections brewed in a French press table side. 
Oatmeal - cooked in milk with peaches added making a unique peaches and cream meal that you can sweeten with maple syrup as needed.

We are not here long, but if we were this would definitely be a regular stop. I don't give five stars very often but this place was close."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Amazing hashes! This place serves really delicious breakfast hashes and coffees. The syrups are made in house and you can tell. The staff was super friendly and very nice. The food and coffee was also really good. You should try this place!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Just wanted a basic breakfast. Had that here but probably would've gotten a better deal at a certain 24-hr restaurant for the same quality of food. Customer service was good though!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Omg!!! Very nice breakfast! Went here twice and really enjoyed it! Benedict was awesome. You can take a walk to the beach after your breakfast and it will be a good start of your day
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"They have healthy options and comfort food, couldn't ask for more! 

I got the egg white frittata and it was so yummy. They give you a whole half an avocado on the side with it and coat it with all kinds of different superfood seeds. The potatoes it came with were seasoned SO well. It's a good amount of food, they certainly don't skimp!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Good food, but didn't give them full 5 stars because it's way to expensive. The coffee is $5 and it's the same coffee you can get across the street for half the price at Santa Barbara roasting company. The build your own hash is great, as well as the ahi tuna sandwich!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is hands down, the best breakfast I have had in over a year !! Sooooo fresh and tasty, I absolutely love this place !!!! The ""build a hash"" concept is fabulous. 10 out of 10 for this place !! Xx"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Everytime we visit SB we hit Dawn Patrol.  Sometimes if we are just passing through we go as well.  We love this place!  The food is great and the staff is great as well!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Waited 40 minutes for food... requested a refund. I have eaten here many times... people were asking where their food was, overheard two complaints about wrong food being delivered. As We requested a refund we were told that our food was being plated. There were customers outside that ordered, prior to our order being placed that had not received food. I've been there during hustle and bustle of food service on a busy weekend. Today's experience was unacceptable, and a waste of time. There was plenty of staff in restaurant and kitchen. 

The thing that was the most unacceptable to me was the dog in the restaurant. None of the staff asked if it was a service animal. In attached picture you can see posted on the wall notification from Santa Barbara County Health Inspector, No Animals Allowed!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The Vegan Option of the Hush Browns, with Veggie sausage was sooo delicious! What a great breakfast! My friend and I really enjoyed it while we visited Santa Barbara!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Nothing bad. Nothing too exciting. 
Full stack (3) of buttermilk pancakes for $11 is tough to swallow and they were just ok. 
Chorizo hash was again, just ok, not much to it; eggs, chorizo and potatoes with some black beans and a bit of avocado.   
Water has a strong chlorine taste, could not even drink it. 
Friendly and hard working staff."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Came back again for the Devilish French Toast. Still great. Breakfast burrito is awesome too. Beverages are expensive here ($4 ice tea) and it's awkward/difficult to try & get any refills, since staff only serves you and does not check up on you... Still great flavors tho"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"What a gem!  Not only was the food delicious but the staff is very friendly and incredibly gracious. They were ready to help us with our order, were attentive during our meal and kept the place so clean. The hash is awesome, try it. Anytime we visit the area we will make this our breakfast destination."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"My wife and  I stopped in Santa Barbara after our drive on PCH from Santa Monica. She found Dawn Patrol from Yelp and glad she did. It was one of the breakfast we had. We love trying local breakfast places on our vacation and DT did not disappoint. I had their ground beef chilaquiles  has. It was like a combination of an open breakfast burrito and nacho. Their tortilla chips were AMAZING! The portion was big too. My wife had the build your  own hash. She love it as well. If you are not a local, you must stop here if you are in SB and try their breakfast. Ask them about how they make their tortilla chips. It was fascinating."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,We wanted to love this place because of the organic nature of all the food. Service was friendly but the food was not fantastic. Coffee was cold (even on the refill!) and the eggs were not good. We just didn't love it.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is outstanding , fresh , delicious , good size portions, friendly service , highly recommend"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Their portions are larger now, food is great too! I loved the salmon omelette special!! Definitely would recommend it as a chill brunch spot on State Street."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I was lucky to remember this slightly out of the way spot where most of state street scoots under highway 101. I'm usually distracted by a cappuccino on the other side of state. 
This morning I found my breakfast light on, meaning that my tank was low. 
Stepped in for a couple of eggs, potatoes, toast and coffee and with tip got out for about $20. Not quite sure if prices are the same in most places but seemed a bit steep for what I got. 
Server was attentive, ambiance was beach-general and nice and the location was okay too. 
One star off for a $20 breakfast (yes, I'm brining it up again :(
And one star off for an unimaginative presentation. Plate, meet eggs and pieces of potato. My experience did not resemble any of the photos that lured me there whatsoever. 
Happy breakfast. 
I may have to try them again to see if it was an off day."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The BEST build your own hash! Very attentive staff and very friendly. I will def go back next time I'm in town.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Always wanted to try this place but it is  B U S Y! Dawn Patrol is a healthier brunch area (at least you can make it to be) and all the food is very fresh tasting.

FOOD: I decided to build my own hash. Had russet potatoes, corned beef, corn, spinach, mushrooms, and the herb aioli sauce. This dish was very flavorful and delicious. Everything was well seasoned and tasted fresh. ~12.50
We also ordered a protein smoothie with coconut water, vanilla whey protein, and coco. It was delicious for 4.50 but something you can make at home.

SERVICE: It was disappointingly slow. Although the restaurant was clearly busy on a Saturday morning, the line took about 15-20 mins before we could actually order. Took another 25 mins to receive our food. 

We had the axxess deal for this place where it is buy one entree get one free, I did enjoy this place but for the prices they have and service I'm not sure I'll be back.

- J"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Breakfast is delicious. Try a hash with hollandaise. Or, if you please, replace the ham in the Benedict with smoked salmon. Service is great for a counter restaurant."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I really want to give them 4 or 5 stars, but I have to give a 3 because the food just isn't as good as I want it to be. I'll start with the good: great location, nice outdoor seating, interesting menu. The food isn't bad, it's just not outstanding. I've been several times, and I'll keeping eating here, but it's not my favorite spot for brunch.

Oh, and the coffee is literally boiling, so be careful!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I came here recently for brunch with my roommate after he said that he was craving breakfast food. Every time I come here, I wonder whether I should finally try something other than their build-a-hash, but it's so good that I keep going back to it.

The manager was very friendly, and kept it casual while I had to wait for my friend. The service here is exceptional and easy-going. Great open, colorful environment to enjoy a casual brunch in. The food speaks for itself and that's all that's necessary for me!

I went for the hash with:
- russet potatoes
- sage sausage
- spinach
- diced tomatoes
- pepperjack
- country gravy
- 2 eggs over easy

The whole concept of putting exactly what you're feeling that day into your hash is fun and keeps you engaged with what you put in your mouth. Everything tastes fresh, and the food really fills you up.

I do think it's a little pricy for what I'm getting sometimes... But I always come back, and enjoy it every time."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is THE place for breakfast! I had the chorizo hash one day, the huervo rancheros the next. My girlfriend had the salmon one day and the tuna fish sandwich the next! All exceeded our expectations! The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure our experience was great."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Ok, holy crap I heard this place was good but man! I had a crazy good crispy chicken sandwich and had some of the build your own hash deal that was very yum yum! Hopefully I can come back and visit from LA sometime again and try more. Btw, the music selection on point"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Hello? Taste? Where are you? 

Remember that story The Emperor Has No Clothes? Well, The Dawn Patrol breakfast San has no taste! Bland as can be. Even the addition of hot sauce doesn't help what should be a great meal. Very disappointing. The Madagascar Vanilla Latte is decent but rather sickly sweet. I couldn't finish. Not an amazing meal. I'd search state street for something better."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Best breakfast I have ever had. I created my own hash. The bacon was so thick and delicious. Fresh wheezed orange juice was perfect. Just wish their vanilla lattes were a bit creamier/sweeter.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Found this place on Yelp while in town for a wedding. No table service, counter service only, which creates lines out the door leaving empty tables. It doesn't really make financial sense as people would just walk away. So with 15 people in line, it's 15-20 min just to order takeout. Then another 20 minutes to get your food. The food looks amazing which is why I waited but had anxiety about where I parked my car. I'll edit the review after eating and hopefully I don't have a towed car or ticket."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Overall: Great food, great service and nice variety of options.

Wait Time/Service: As a local, I would never attempt to go here on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday morning. I can't imagine how busy it would be! But if you can swing a weekday (and an early arrival) I don't think the wait is bad at all. Maybe 10 minutes on a busy day, max. The service has always been friendly, I don't think I've had a bad experience here in that regard. Smiles all around, which is lovely. 

Food: I don't drink juice (green or otherwise) , so I can't attest to the juices, but my friends love the juice here. The coffee is good. I've had better, but it far surpasses most breakfast joints in town. As everyone has said already, the build your own hash option is a great idea that isn't gimmicky, it actually is worth the special ordering option! 

Also, they know how to cook eggs. Over easy, medium and scrambled are done RIGHT....and done right every time. 

Bottom line: Weekends might be busy but probably worth it if you want a high quality, ""real food"" type of breakfast.  Weekdays are quieter and definitely worth it."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,I recommend that you find this tucked away gem.  The menu is perfect. The service is friendly and professional. The food is delicious. The coffee sublime. The decor is utterly cool. This place is perfection. The people who own this restaurant know what they are doing. I will be frequenting this place and you should too. You won't be disappointed.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Let's start with how patrons are seated. You wait in line to place your order and then seek out a table to seat yourself. Of course most people don't respect the rule that you must place your order and receive a table marker before you sit - ""saving"" tables is common. Well I wasn't about to be a sucker and not grab a table either, so I did. A waiter booted me out though and I told him how everyone was doing the same, just look around. Not sure why I was targeted but they should be policing everyone equally.

Onto the food - tasteless and expensive. Take a look at my breakfast burrito, which cost me 11 unsavory smacks. Unceremoniously placed on a plate with none of the usual breakfast accoutrements. It was severely missing a spice, and that was salt. I would've added some myself but, well, look at the friendly creature I found in Exhibit B.

TL;DR: not worth the line, not worth the $$, unless you like bonus protein in the form of critters."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Relatively mediocre...Customized a hash with salmon...there was very little salmon and the veggies were a bit greasy for my liking. Also, shared an egg white frittata that was somewhat greasy and flavorless. The seeded avocado made the plate a whole lot more interesting. Overall, the food was lackluster. Also, ordered a chai that is advertised as spicy, but it was much more on the sweet side of things. Just okay!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The cold brew had to have been old coffee from the day before. My egg white frittata was pretty good and I can't complain for the price. Just go elsewhere for your coffee but if you're looking for a healthy and simple breakfast before a hike, the food was good."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"My girlfriend and I went here to celebrate finishing our first semester of college and we were not disappointed one bit. We've been searching Santa Barbara for the perfect breakfast place and we found it here at Dawn Patrol. The customer service was excellent. The food and coffee were superb. It wasn't the cheapest meal, but it was definitely worth the money. We will be coming back for sure."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Beautiful view but the food was just ok. Took my mom here for an early Mother's Day and we came for Friday lunch. Considering that there were only 4-6 tables the service was lacking.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So, I rarely write reviews. Why? Average food doesn't warent the time and writing a bad review... Don't want the Karma. A good review, well that requires a really good experience. And when I travel, I rely on Yelp reviews to guide me to a good meal. Dawn Patrol was really good. ""Build a hash"" was delicious. Fresh ingredients, exceptional flavors, friendly service. Definitely worth getting off the freeway, finding parking and taking the time for a sit down breakfast. Give it a try, I doubt you will be disappointed."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great Food! My order initially came out wrong, but they have impeccable customer service and it was corrected immediately. Perfect for kids and dogs too."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I come to Santa Barbra often .. just finished the gym and came by one of the only places open. John helped me set up a amazing plate and I have to say I am impressed. The presentation , the service, the vibe. It's all here and a good start to a morning. Thank you guys for doing the right thing and that's good food and service .

John killed it!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Best breakfast burrito I've ever had. No joke. Not elaborating.  I write this as I take the last bite.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Fun to order a create your own hash.  Pretty good too.  The atmosphere was more casual than I expected.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Super yummy place! Loved the options for food available here - and the fact that you can bring dogs and sit outside. Finding a parking place and the line to order were the 2 negatives. I'm a Santa Barbara local, but had to circle the block to find a place appropriate to park. Had the breakfast burrito, and it was sublime. Good coffee."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The breakfast here is so top notch! We got a frittata and a make your own hash. The hash has a variety of things to offer and I don't think you can go wrong with any of it at all - any combination would most likely be good. The hash also comes with wheat toast or mixed greens. I would definitely come back here again for breakfast even though it is a little bit on the pricer side.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,What a great place to have breakfast! Loved it I couldn't take any pictures because I already ate it lol! They use Emojis
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Really good, fresh/yummy food! Go in and grab a table if one is open and send whoever your with to go order. Great service and build your own hash is their specialty and the way to go! We will definitely be back to Dawn Patrol the next time we are in SB!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Don't go here if you don't want to wait at least an hour for your food. The worst service I have experienced in a long time. No empathy or acknowledgement that we waited entirely too long. Save yourself the headache and go elsewhere?
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Build your own hash?  yes please!  Wish we found this place yesterday. The corned beef in my hash was sooo good.  The girl working out front is a sweetheart and very personable.  Next time we are in town we will be back and you should too!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Man I really wanted to love this place. It's good and it has the potential to be great. I have had breakfast a Dawn patrol twice now and both times felt a little like something is missing.

Dawn Patrol does not seat you or assign you a table. You order at the counter and grab a seat. The problem with this is that people don't always respect the first come first serve educate. I have actually had to stand while holding my coffee waiting for a table to open up while people that have yet to order are sitting holding tables, while waiting for friends I am absolutely tired of these fast casual establishments that require you to work for your dining experience. 

The food is creative and pretty tasty but when I go out to breakfast I don't want to feel like I need to strategize to get a decent table."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I've been several times--always enjoyed it. Creative menu, very good food, large portions, friendly staff."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Good little spot to grab some healthy breakfast and good coffee. Outdoor seating was nice with great service.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"great breakfast, super staff. we are plant based eaters, and they helped us out. we will be back for sure."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great place , excellent food!! Love the Frittata, coffee is awesome, clean and good friendly service. Easy access from the freeway. Will come back again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Visited Dawn Patrol for brunch during our vacation trip to Santa Barbara. We had the chorizo hash, a build your own hash with added avocado, and two mimosas.
The mimosas here are probably the best I've ever had- the ratio of alcohol to juice being perfect. 
The price is a bit on the higher side but I give this spot a 5 for generous portions, friendly staff, and awesome mimosas."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Amazing, great customer service. It was our first time at this location. Our server explained the menu and the vibe of the establishment. It gets busy on the weekends but worth the wait. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. My husband and I will definitely be back. Food came out quickly and it was amazing. All Covid 19 rules were followed."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Awesome. Delicious. 15 minute wait but well worth it. Hash was incredible and so were the pancakes. Nice staff too. 100% would recommend.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Not the worse place, but everything taste kind of boring. Cool place, but food not so much..."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is one of my favorite Santa Barbara brunch hang outs. The staff is friendly and although it can get busy they do a pretty good job. You cant beat the build your own hash..tasty and healthy! Their coffee is great and the smoothies as a MUST TRY. My favorite part is that the ingredients looks and taste fresh. I will keep coming back, thanks Dawn Patrol!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place is your go to for breakfast when in Santa Barbara. The line is out the door for a reason! The menu is simple and the food is delicious. The service is great too. I highly recommend this venue.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Very overpriced for what it is.  We paid $50 for their popular make your own hash and a combo and 2 drinks.  The eggs weren't seasoned and the aioli didn't taste like much.  The orange juice was delicious and fresh though
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Excellent breakfast hash. Great customer service and ambiance. Santa Barbara beach Sufer feel. Will come again
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"It's a quaint spot with delicious food and coffee. Opens real early and serves freshly baked scones and coffee cake. Scones were mouth watering,  not too sweet which is great. The made to order hash is great too. Loved it!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great service and food. Very tasty and easy to choose. The scones are to die for. Staff are pleasant and accommodating. There is WiFi available
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Visiting from San Juan Capistrano and I loved the energy and vibe of this place. We chose to sit outside because the day is beautiful, sunny and fresh. Wonderful customer service, didn't get her name but she was blonde with sweet flower tattoos on her left arm:) Last but not least, the food is delicious!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent food. Really friendly staff. I had the breakfast burrito and my husband had their ""Build a Hash"" and fresh squeezed orange juice. It was all fantastic."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"We were excited to try this place after reading some rave reviews. I think it is mostly frequented by tourists who are hungry. That is the only way to explain its popularity. The approach to this place is awkwardly placed next to an overhead pass. The first thing that put me off was the ""fresh squeezed"" orange juice tasted stale and mixed with tropicana or something. The breakfast was absolutely terrible. The pancakes were incredibly dry and hard to swallow without drowning them i syrup. The eggs were just okay. It is a self service place and felt rushed and frantic. Tables were dirty and unattended. Overall it was a big ""NOPE!"""
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I first came here in May. After ordering a hash and a regular drip coffee, I got a hash with no potatoes and had to go up to the counter after 10 minutes to get the coffee. I paid with Square and, for the first time, I left feedback via the Square email. Soon after, the manager/owner(?) came up to me to comp my meal. Also, I got a Square email reply with a $15 coupon for my next visit.

I didn't come back to SB until this past week. Luckily, this time, they got my hash right but I still had to wait for a simple cup of regular coffee. My friend got her cold brew shortly after sitting down (the same thing happened in May) but I had to go up to the counter to ask for my coffee.

It can't be that hard to remember to pour a cup of coffee and either hand it to the customer at the register or bring it to their table like what was done for my friend and her cold brew. Frankly, the only reason we returned was to use the $15 credit. But after they didn't fully redeem themselves, I don't think I'll return again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is definitely my favorite brunch place to go to I'm Santa Barbara. It was a lil hard to find, but I'm so glad I was able to eat here. The servers were nice and friendly which made me feel welcomed. I ordered a Madagascar vanilla bean latte and I kid you know when I say this was the most amazing latte ever. It fit my sweet taste buds perfectly, I'm still in shocked. As for my meal, I build my own hash with potatoes, bacon, and herb aioli sauce. You would definitely not get something this tasty back in LA. Also, their strawberry jam was homemade (just like the coffee) and I fell in love with it. I will be coming back"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I had a protein shake, breakfast sando with bacon and a cup of coffee. It was pretty good. Very nice staff."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Food was decent, service was nonfunctional. I was charged for an item I didn't even order and when I asked the server, he acted as if it was my fault I was charged for the extra item. It's a order upfront and seat yourself type of spot which makes for strange seating arrangements. Food was nothing special, the dawn patrol combo does the job and the French toast with which they use their house Hawaiian bread was decent overall. Would have given a better rating if the service was upgraded. 2.5 stars overall"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I was visiting SB & I just happened to search for ""brunch"" & I'm so glad this came up! Pros: Food was delicious , parking is available across the street , first 75 min was free (on Sunday, not sure what the other days offer) & it's walking distance from the beach or shops if you want to take a stroll after eating. Small cons:it's ""self seating "" so you order as soon as you get to the front of the line, since I was not aware I felt rushed ordering . Wait lines to find a seat can be long ( the place is relatively small for being on State St , a naturally busy location). However , servers are attentive & very kind. Overall , if you like good food, are ok with adjusting to the self seating and can be patient while a spot opens this is a good place to try !"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Build a hash is delicious! My kids get the gluten free pancakes or luau French toast, and both are also good! One of the few places you can get gluten free pancakes and they taste good! Prices are not cheap, but then again nothing is in SB so you just get used to it. 
Weekends are busy and expect to wait quite a while for your food. This place is sit down but you order at the counter and get your own water and sugar etc for coffee."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Delicious food and wonderful service. This place will be my must stop for breakfast/brunch anytime I'm in town.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The build-your-own hash is superb, and everything is homemade and super fresh. Can't resist weekend brunch here!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"In Santa Barbara for our anniversary and I found this place on Yelp. Hubby had make your own hash with potatoes, apple wood bacon, spinach and tomatoes with eggs over easy and salsa - he loved it. When I think of hash, I think of corn beef hash that comes out of a can, this was nothing like that. Instead this was a delicious blend of fresh, delightful flavors. I love omelettes and though they don't have them on the menu they were happy to make one to order. I picked off the make your own hash menu and they fixed it up with egg whites at my request, omelette style - perfect. The setting is very casual, order at the counter and they bring the food to you. We sat on the patio which was quite comfortable. The view nothing special, but it was great to be outside enjoying the wonderful Santa Barbara climate. Service was great."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great local place for breakfast. Ate here a couple weeks ago while seeing colleges with my daughter. A couple guys running the floor the day we were in. I had huevos rancheros and daughter had french toast. Good and Good.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This was some of the best brunch we ever had. The line seemed long and intimidating at first, but once we ordered, the food came fairly quickly. The vanilla bean latte was so delicious (albeit, I was starving), and the hash was hearty and healthy, leaving me with a happy tummy and not overly stuffed like I am a lot of times I leave brunch places. Wish I lived in SB just to go back to this place!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Bomb! I ordered the build ur own hash with potatoes, salmon, veggies, scrambled eggs, and hollandaise sauce, and a spicy chai

The hash was deliciously hearty without being overwhelming. It was served with a side salad and toast. 

The chai was perfect, spicy and not too sweet. I went with a party of four and everyone was very pleased with their orders. Everything was so good! My boyfriend ordered a side of pancakes which I felt were a bit small for the price, other than that, everything was great!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"This was my first time coming here. The place is super cool, they have friendly staff, good music, the vibe is awesome. We ordered, chorizo hash and my Gf built her breakfast. The only reason I'm giving it a three, the salsas that came with my  order tasted like a dressing -glad I got it on the side. The beans were bland, and the vanilla bean latte we got just tasted watered down. There was no real flavor at all. 


 But the places is cool and busy."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great food, great service, great location. Try the chili quilies. Bomb!!! Iced local coffee!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Loved this place! I've tried coming here once before but the line was out the door so we gave up. Today we came back and OMG it was worth it!!!
I love everything about this place!! The amount of details on everything is amazing!!! I live the surfer vibe, the surfer music, the tables made of old wooden long boards; the condiment boxes eith little bottle openers on the side, the fact that EVERYTABLE has its own set of plugs for charges (hello, milenials)!!! 
And the food was super delicious!! I had the burger add egg! Super yummy!!! The hubby had the build your own hash. We couldn't decide which was better.
Service was great and you even get to pick your emoji to be your order ""number"".
Will definitely be back a million times!!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place Is amazing!!!! Bread is fresh and they serve your food nice and hot! Seriously a gem . Fresh coffe
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Very impressed by this restaurant. I just went there this morning. Everything about the restaurant is positive. Food came out fast coffee was incredible service was delightful. I love hole in the wall places like this. You will not be disappointed!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great build your own hash! 

I had potatoes, spinach, bell pepper and salsa. It came with a little salad and was just the right portion!

So many different choices you could have something different every time. 

We will be back soon!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We came here with a large group the night after a wedding. I have the Hash and it was so amazing! The service was perfect and we all totally enjoyed our breakfasts. 
They also have gluten free choices. Great place a little tucked away, so park and walk over! Highly recommended this spot!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We came here on a Friday mid morning, it was pretty slow so I was wondering whether it was any good. It was delicious and the staff were knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in general. I got the corn scallion biscuit with a soft boiled egg inside. Came with potatoes and I had a side of fruit as well. It was fabulous, a perfect blend of flavors. My husband got the French toast with bacon pieces and jalapeño jelly. I had to steal several bites it was so amazing. I also had a nice oatmeal stout from a can. I believe it was Anderson valley from Montana? Also we sat on their radical outdoor patio. Give this place a chance it was awesome!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"One of the best huevos rancheros I've ever had.
The coffee was good too! Friendly service. I will definitely  come back when come back to Santa Barbara."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Dawn Patrol is a good, casual no-frills brunch spot in SB! The restaurant itself has a lot of character, and spacious indoor + outdoor seating! 

I tried the luau french toast, but I honestly wasn't impressed. I found it to be quite dry and not that flavorful. I also paid $9 for a small [2 pieces] but I wish I had gotten the large instead for $13 because it wasn't filling enough. I also tried the Madagascar vanilla latte and really liked it! It had a good flavor and the mug was huge! 

My friend tried the ""build a hash"" and really liked it--that seems to be the thing to get here. Overall, I liked the vibe of Dawn Patrol but the french toast was nothing special. I'm down to come again and try the hash next time!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,I love a good burger and I got one at Dawn Patrol. The portions are large and everything was fresh. The bacon was a big hit with those who ordered it.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"This place is definitely over hyped. It was good- don't get me wrong but great? No, I was kind of disappointed. 

First, let's talk about the positives. It has outdoor seating which was nice because I was able to bring my dog. It's also very affordable and order at the counter which is nice if you're on a budget. I also like the concept of building your own hash- very cool. 

So on to the negatives. The outdoor seating was on a loud busy street which was annoying. The biggest drawback was the food though. Maybe it was the way everyone was raving about this place that is bumping this down a star but the food was just mediocre I think. Here's what we ordered (see pics also)

- Breakfast burrito- it wasn't anything special and kind of small for the price per my fiancé.  
- Build your own hash- sweet potatoes, veggies, veggie sausage, pepper jack cheese, eggs over easy with herb aioli. Also on the side was mixed greens and toast. I was SO EXCITED when I ordered this. However, when it arrived it was just ok. The herb aioli wasn't very flavorful at all. I think I might have done better with hollandaise."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Amazing food and Coen was super helpful and friendly. He made a dirty chai soy latte that was so good! Definitely recommend this place for brunch.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Service is excellent and the food is delicious! Had the ""Make your own Hash"" and went with sweet potatoes, salmon, veggies, avo and pepper jack cheese  the only negative is that my water glass smelled like soapy water...it had that not rinsed well stink. So I had a couple sips and stuck to coffee. BUT the food, ambiance and service was great. Definitely recommend and would come back for brekke anytime."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Ok, let me get started by saying Wow! Incredible build a hash menu, fresh ingredients flavors, they break it down in a selection menu of 5 steps. Start off with a base of russet or sweet potatoes and onions then pick a protein, add your veggies and cheese, then eggs any style, then smother it with 1 of 4 toppings, the holladaise was delicious! 

You have to try the gluten free pancakes incredible with a peach fruit topping and almonds yummy, by the way did I say yummy! Yes I did. 

At state and guitierrez, have a delicious meal here, super friendly and the food is super yummy"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I ordered the Caesar Salad. It was room temperature and the croutons were soggy. The water was straight out of the tap, which is ok, but no ice is offered, so it was room temperature as well. Just sub-par at best all the way around. My wife enjoyed her Eggs Benedict. I expected a more vegan-friendly menu for a Santa Barbara eatery, but no luck. If you're vegan, look elsewhere."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The food is delicious and the vibe is awesome. We were greeted at the door with a welcome and an explanation of the menu and the service. The hardest part was deciding whether to go with the hash or gluten free pancakes. The hash was wonderful and the service made it even better. Try it, you'll like it!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We were looking for a brunch place in Santa Barbara that served great food and didn't have a crazy long wait time. Dawn Patrol followed all our guidelines and the food was fantastic!

Ordered the famous Build Your Own Hash with Corn Beef, Poached Eggs, and the Herb Aioli. The dish was massive and came with so much food included plenty of toasted bread. The Corn Beef was cooked perfectly and tasted divine dipped in the Herb Aioli. Do yourself a favor and try the corn beef hash here, it might not be the healthiest but its worth the calories!

Coming from San Francisco, I thought the prices here were quite reasonable and way cheaper than the Bay Area. $14 for a Corn Hash with plenty of food and bread is a great deal. I seriously can't complain!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Wow!!!!! What a find!!! This place is awesome! Best grilled cheese I have ever eaten! Ace is almost to the 101, but well worth the walk! Staff is very friendly, place is clean! Really happy to have found this spot!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fresh, delicious! Better that baby barnaby. Our second meal in LA! Surprise all the way. This is my family's ten years celebration trip."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Dawn Patrol was good.  Not exceptional.  Good. We ordered the hamburger meat chilaquiles, chorizo hash, cold brew coffee, hot coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice ($47). 

This is a good place to go - helpful attentive staff, nice atmosphere, and good food.  But I feel like I've had this meal many times before.  There are other places in SB with more creative menus and flavors for the same price."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Was so excited to try this after seeing the reviews. Walked there from the hotel and it was closed. Didn't see that update on their website.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Off the CHAIN! Hash with the shredded chicken and cheddar! Poppy had the corned beef hash, and the kids had the buttermilk pancakes! We are adding this restaurant to our ""Santa Barbara eats"" must visits!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great casual breakfast spot with lots of healthy options.  Order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Good coffee.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is awesome - super friendly staff, great prices for Santa Barbara, awesome food and really good sized portions.

I ordered an orange juice, but they hadn't gotten their orange delivery in for the day, kind of a bummer, but I totally understood.

After our food came out I noticed a delivery guy bringing in what looked to be boxes of fruit/oranges. Crap, I thought. Bad timing on my part. I even thought about getting up to go order a glass, but was already eating so I didn't bother.

5 minutes later the manager walks out with a fresh squeezed OJ on the house - who does that?! 

Only a place as awesome as Dawn Patrol! Go here, you won't be disappointed."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The food was good but man, we waited 50 min for two items and it wasn't that crazy busy. Need more cooks in da kitchen!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So good!! Get the quiche lorraine! Also, such a lovely staff that makes you feel welcome."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I wouldn't think that a lack of comfort and convenience would have negatively impacted having breakfast, but it did. During our visit, the restaurant had no heat plus something wrong with the credit card processing so cash only with no receipt.

I don't think well when I'm cold and didn't want to go through the work of ""build your own hash"". Instead, we picked the one pre-designed chorizo hash that was mostly large blocks of potato but barely any avocado and salsa. Designed with Mexican flair, the hash came with sides of black beans, three small corn tortillas, and sour cream sauce flavored with cumin. For a hash, the scrambled egg almost became incidental.

My palate doesn't taste much when I'm cold which could be why the egg frittata was bland. With half-dozen small chunks of potatoes, a dozen leaves of spinach, and jack cheese, the health-conscious frittata wasn't filling.  Additionally, the recipe didn't seem to have strong source of flavor and was underseasoned. On the side was a partially ripe avocado studded with seeds like pepitas.

Order at the counter. Both indoor and outdoor seating. 75 minutes of free parking across the street in the city-run lot. The popularly-written about prisoner egg muffin was not on the menu."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Perfect brunch spot. Build your hash with with homemade spicy chai spoiled me. Great place, great location and service."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Wonderful customer service. Friendly employees. Yummy food. Our family of 4 all enjoyed their meals. Everything is handmade and delicious.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent, quality food. Stopped here for breakfast on our way up the coast because it had good reviews and on the website it said local and organic choices. More than anything, I value quality food and I'm super picky but everything was fantastic. From the friendly staff, to the service and quality of the food, I rate this place 5 stars. I highly recommend the Patrol Combo. Best bacon I ever had! I had the scone instead of toast. Def the way to go! I rarely ever write reviews but since I decided to go to this place based off reviews and I loved it, I figured I should pay my dues back! Enjoy!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Wow this place is good. I stopped here for breakfast and I got the patrol burger. It was one of the best and most unique burgers I've ever had. I absolutely loved it. The service was great, employees were really friendly. I really love all the shops in Santa Barbara. 
A+"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Incredible food!! The hash is amazing and the coffees and fresh juices are delish!  The prices are a little steep, but hey, it's Santa Barbara...  LOL. We will def be going back each time we visit."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Best breakfast in town I'm coming for years and I never be disappointed. Good quality food large portions
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We had breakfast here and it was great. I had the pancakes and they were like home made. The ambience is a very comfortable surfer vibe. You order the food at the counter and then they bring it out to you. The service was very helpful and friendly. If you're looking for a good, quick breakfast in S.B. check this place out."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I am in Santa Barbara for work, and my hotels doesn't offer a hot breakfast. After yelping around I chose Dawn Patrol. 
I am so happy I did. The service was excellent. Though it was a little pricey I the food was worth it. 
I did choose your own hash and a soy latte. Both were excellent, and the place itself is open and airy. I will definitely come back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place was excellent! We called for pick up and when we arrived everything was ready and the service was great! Very friendly and the food was amazing! Great coffee and fresh OJ as well. We got the breakfast burrito and The Patrol, they were both full of flavor and tasted fresh. Will definitely be coming back!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fresh flavor. My boyfriend ordered Huevos Rancheros, and while I liked my own breakfast, I was coveting his.  Usually this dish is just ho hum to me. But Dawn Patrol has some amazing flavors going on. So much so that I kept dipping my potatoes in his sauce. Annoying, right?  I enjoyed their gluten-free pancakes. OJ was fresh squeezed. My hot tea was loose leaf brewed in a cute little press pot. Get there early, the line to order does grow rapidly. Service was super-friendly and efficient. Loved the surfer decor, right down to the surfboard pieces lined up like subway tiles in the bathroom. DP thought of all the details. I'd go all the time if I lived there."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Not too busy, it's counter style so you order at the counter and they bring it to you. 

I had the crab cake bennedict and it was DELICIOUS. Full of crab and came with potatoes and a side salad.

My gluten free date had the hash and it was also very good."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately falls short of expectations. Iced latte was unimpressive and tasted muted. Food took way too long to come out, and when it did, was bland. Eggs had no flavor aside from the cheese, sausage was dry and dull. Way too overpriced for what we received. Having a gluten allergy I ordered the gluten free pancake.. 1 pancake for $3.50.. a bit steep for an underwhelming pancake. The service wasn't great either. I explained to the waiter how I was unimpressed with the latte, and he seemed annoyed and rushed. The only one who seemed to enjoy his job was the younger guy with glasses, he was nice and seemed to care about customer service. He recommended if do come back to try the Huevos Rancheros. As much as I would've wanted to like this place, I can say I likely won't be coming back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Another great breakfast at Dawn Patrol! We've been here 3 Sunday's in a row. Tried something different each morning (w/ a side of pancakes or French toast). Haven't found anything we didn't love!
The worst thing I can say is that we've had to wait in a long line if we get here mid morning. 
Great food and great service."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We tried this place for the first time today, and it was definitely a success! The food was incredible, the vibe was fun, and the staff was so helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend it for breakfast or lunch!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"They advertise on Yelp they are open for take out, however you can't order through yelp or online and have to call instead. Called few times and no one answered."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Food was great! Mimosas were delicious, they use freshly squeezed orange for the mimosas. We also enjoyed the chorizo hash, definitely recommend! Has a chill vibe."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great place for breakfast and the staff was amazing. It's a little hidden but well worth the find!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I'm not going to knock you on this.... But we could not find your place. Even the employees at cash blan a didn't know where you are!! 
We followed the sign... It's posted showing the arrow into the parking lot. We searched all the doors businesses.... Asked people couldn't find it. No one knew where it is... 

As we walked over from Backyard bowl after we finished eating our breakfast and saw it from across the street we said, oh! There it is! Hope someone corrects the sign because we met 2 other couples in backyard bowls that did the same thing we did!!! 

Fix the basics, guys... Like directions to your restaurant!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Pretty good brunch place--a little bit overpriced / maybe small-ish portions for what you are paying, but I though it was great overall. I would definitely go back in the future. I had the breakfast sandwich and then my friend had the roll egg situation, which also was good."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"love this little spot on state street! I went for breakfast & was very pleased. I had a breakfast built a hash bowl where you choose your meat & all the other goodies. I chose salmon with sweet potatoes,avocad, poached egg & smothered it in hollandaise sauce, YUM! they also have gluten free options. MUST TRY!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Found this gem while visiting California and I've been dreaming of the sweet potato hash with veggie sausage and bell pepper ever since.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We were in town visiting UCSB. Loved this place - the food was stellar as was the ambience. Egg white frittata made my day. My daughters friend said her pancakes were the best she's ever had. Hope to go back!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Headed down to State early this morning and we were happy to find a place open first thing in the am. Menu had a ton of choices that covered both healthy and comfort food options. We were all over the board with our orders- huevos rancheros, chorizo hash, scrambled eggs/bacon/toast, build your own hash with sausage, and a state street salad. EVERYONE loved their meal. Serving size was great, flavors were on point, and everything hit great flavor notes- savory, salty, and fresh. Loved the outside seating as well, tons of room and easily fit our party of 5. Will make this one of our go to's when in SB."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Stopped in Santa Barbara for a quick breakfast and decided to try Dawn Patrol. The salmon caught my eye and I was able to sub the sprouted toast with a GF pancake for a few dollars' upcharge. Some friends got the burrito, a skillet, and regular salmon. 

I was pretty disappointed when I got my food and it was just tiny, especially for over $20. The pancake was good, but really, really small. The lemon whipped butter was so good, as was the fruit on it, but the syrup wasn't real, and the almonds aren't anything super special. The salmon was disappointing overall (guess I'm used to Seattle, now...), but the pickled onions sandwiched between the slices of salmon were good...

They forgot my coffee (no big deal, and they gave me a bigger cup once I let them know), and it was pretty good. The place is fun, but too expensive. If you want a lot of food, go for a skillet, and definitely not the salmon."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Build-your-own hash. More details not even necessary. 

Service & atmosphere: the space is casual with a beautiful outdoor space with high ceilings. Going on a Sunday morning? Be prepared to wait in line to order and then wait for your food and then also scramble to find a table. Don't worry, it works out. 

Food: There are a ton of good choices, even within the build your own has option. I chose the special hash with chorizo because all the choices were overwhelming me. It was delicious! Super flavorful and a little greasy (which I love) mix of chorizo and veggies with toast, beans, and eggs. I wish I could give you more detail, but it was just simply good and you'll have to come try it.

When I gather enough conviction I'll come back to build my own hash."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Amazing food. Probably best chorizo I've had. Very friendly service,great location and interior. Great job guys !"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Delicious! Love that you can ""create your own"" hash. Perfect for a big family breakfast."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The food was pretty good.  However, after we ordered and sat down, we had to wait about 10 minutes for the waiters to come clean our tables.  That was a huge turn off."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Love this place. Great pancakes. Fresh fruit. Tasty hot chocolate. And the ham is good.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Went here with a few friends for brunch one day. Honestly did not know this place even existed, it is kinda tucked back where you can't see it well from the main road. The staff was super friendly and cooperative. We let them know we had not been there before so they walked us through the menu and told us how everything looked and gave us their recommendations--this is a huge bonus for me. Having worked in a restaurant myself, I would always give my honest opinion when customers asked me my recommendations and you could tell the Dawn Patrol workers did the same! We all built our own hash with a variety of different meats and toppings. We all left happy and full! Great place to meet with friends so everyone can get a little of everything."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"During Covid... delicious, they served the food very quickly. Everything was pretty good. A little pricey but conveniently located. Yes I recommend this place and I would love to get back"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"A+
It's so nice to go to a not-expensive restaurant and see such attention to detail and be treated like we're spending more.
There was no line which was nice; we've tried to come before but with a long line, we have left,
The food is solid, clean, not greasy. The service was friendly and professional. The decor is pleasant and the service items are clean and modern (glasses, bottles of water, tea pots, etc)"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I chose this spot as my last meal in the city since it was walking distance to the AMTRAK station, and arrived right when they opened. So I was able to snag a spot on the patio to soak in the fresh air while I ate my meal.

The Build-Your-Own-Hash seemed to be popular, so that's what I ordered.

+ Roasted Russet Potatoes Base
+ Applewood Smoked Bacon
+ Poached Eggs
+ Spinach
+ Corn 
+ Mushrooms
+ Wheat Toast
+ Aioli sauce
+ Cheddar
+ Avocado ($2)

It was VERY satisfying! I was impressed with the wheat toast because it wasn't a plain wimpy wheat, but a very hearty and dense, with nuts type wheat. You'll need to request their housemade jam to go with it (it's free).

My particular combo hash was so delicious, I gobbled up everything. I appreciated that it came with a side salad too, to balance out the richness. 

It's fun choosing your own options, but next time I don't think I'll add the avocado. Since you only get half of one, and it costs $2 more.

Patio is dog-friendly too."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Super good.   Staff is polite and very helpful.  The food was terrific!   I had the Chorizo Hash -- asked for sweet potatoes v russet which they happily accommodated --  and it was outstanding.   She had the egg white frittata and liked everything about the food presentataion.   Highly recommend this for a nice breakfast / brunch.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fresh Squeezed orange juice - yum! Pancakes, build-a-hash, luau toast were all great! Will return when we're back in the area."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,I can see what this place is trying to be. It's a good concept but the execution is lacking in several dimensions most notably the food.   The recipes are fine but simply not that tasty.  The staff is friendly but the table was sticky and wobbly and a couple of flies kept surrounding this. Parking's a bit tricky.  Overall... meh
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Delicious breakfast and friendly, helpful staff. Salmon hash and huevos rancheros were fantastic."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Very delicious food! The made your self hash is soooo good. Waiting on Sunday 9.30am is around 30 mins.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This was a great little breakfast spot in the Funk Zone.  It's got Hawaiian flair so think loco moco for breakfast and my favorite:  build your own hash.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.

They had a nice covered patio out front as well as plenty of seating indoors and the service was friendly.  Would definitely stop in again for a tasty and reasonably priced brekky you can wear flip-flops to enjoy."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"BEST BRUNCH IN TOWN
and I don't even like brunch. 
disclaimer: I don't like eggs, I think typical brunch places are waay to carb heavy, and there are never enough vegetables or fruit.

This place is so fantastic and rich with personality. They use emoji place holders to identify your table !! My friends decided to rally there for a Saturday morning and it has easily become our regular brunch spot. Saturday around noon there's also a women's kickboxing class down the corner after which all the women gather outside in their athleisure wear... 

Post-Workout Revitalizer is sooo good after a hike! Coconutty and protein-rich, you might just down it in your first gulp, beware. They also have a huge orange juicing machine so you can get fresh orange juice by the pitcher for your table.

Chef's Special: Calisco, you cooked the steak to perfection. Thank you so much for including a heavy dose of well-spiced vegetables. I don't know what cheese you used, but it brought the whole meal together. You have reformed me into a bruncher, so as long as you cook the meals, I'll be there.

Well-priced for excellent quality food, service and inviting atmosphere. Must visit!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I was starving and looking forward to a hearty breakfast. Although it was Monday after 11am, there was a line that took 15 minutes to get through. Once the order was placed, it took over 30 minutes to get the meal. I had the patrol combo. They ran out of sausage. They ran out of scones. So it was scrambled eggs and bacon and 1 sad piece of dry wheat toast. I could make better at home and it would not take 45 minutes to make. My gf had the oatmeal which was a hearty bowl with apricots and actually much better than my meal. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. The complimentary water tasted terrible- like chlorine. Somebody else commented on this as well. I had to buy the Fiji water. 
I would not return. The servers were nice and friendly though."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"After a night of binge drinking, and watching my beloved Raiders get handled once again by the Kansas City Chiefs - We needed something to soak up the vodka, whiskey, gin, cognac, tequila, scotch, rum, wine, and beer.

A bit overpriced, but no surprise since it is in SB and on State Street...ordered Eggs Benedict and Breakfast Burrito with sausage.  The breakfast burrito cost about 13.00 and at first glance it looked average...but like the old saying goes NEVER judge a book by its cover!  The BEST breakfast burrito I have ever had (I'm a fat a$$ so I know) fresh ingredients and deliciously made.  Service was very good as well.  From headaches and somewhat a acidic stomach from various alcoholic beverages from the night before, this place did the job to cure and tasted great!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Outstanding breakfast!!! Delicious vegan options including the 'build a hash'
Pleasant service, clean and lovely establishment"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Very good food - when we visited, they had only been open a week because of good food. The location is hard to scout out though. There are no signs and maps doesn't really help you find the place."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"While visiting Santa Barbara, my friend and I found this neat little breakfast spot. There was a line outside and tables were full so we felt good about the place. We liked the order first then pick your table and they'll bring your food to you. I had the Eggs Benedict and they were excellent, the eggs were cooked to perfection. My friend really liked their French roast coffee, enough to get 2 more refills, refills are free btw on this coffee. Their strawberry vanilla jam that they served with the toast was absolutely delicious. Probably will come back to it on another SB visit."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Seriously amazing.  First stop on our honeymoon roadtrip (because my name is Dawn) and this place is great.  The Tomato Jam on the Patrol burger was insane.  I loved it and I hate tomatoes.  What ever they put in it was perfect.  The staff was great and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his chicken sandwich.  I know the food we ordered might sound mundane but it is out of this world delicious!!!#sofull
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Love the Chorizo hash!  Great brunch spot.  High quality fresh food and tea/coffee.   Really nice staff and a comfortable SB beach vibe.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Must go. May be our new go to. Great employees and adequate space outside to enjoy the weather and delicious food. The usual favorites with a delicious twist. The seeded avocado is such a great added touch. Pancake may have been the best I've had in years. Thank you!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Eggs benny: 10/10. Almond milk iced coffee 10/10. Outdoor seating *chefs kiss*

Staff? AMAZING

Please give this little spot a try. It was a pleasant experience and great breakfast food."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Worst customer experience ever. Came here for brunch around 11am on Sat because of the high reviews. Waited in line and when it came time to order, it took them almost 10 min because they can't seem to understand our simple order. I ordered a cheeseburger with no onions and ketchup. I did not request for a Patrol burger, I wanted a cheeseburger (off the kids menu) with no onions and ketchup. The cashier seemed so confuse and asked me to repeat my order a few times, then 1 other person came to assist her and asked me to repeat again. The man that came to assist asked if I judged wanted to order a cheeseburger off the kids menu since my order was simple. I said ""yes, that's what I wanted."" And when one of my friend ordered their Tuna Poke Salad, she was told they ran out of Tuna. My other friend ordered the Herbivore and was told they are out of kale. She also ordered an iced vanilla macchiato and received a small hot macchiato. When we try to bring it up to the manager, he gave us a dumb look after we explained the macchiato is not what we ordered. His response was ""and...."", so I had to repeat myself and told him we ""ordered an ICED vanilla macchiato, and this is not iced."" He walked away and brought out our receipt order, he said ""you guys ordered a macchiato, if you guys want iced vanilla macchiato, that's going to be more."" My friend wanted to just make it simple and said ""then can I change to iced vanilla latte"". His response ""it'll be 50 cents more."" So we paid the 50 cents because this was getting ridiculous. This place can't even comp us the 50 cents when their cashier messed up on our order? We waited for our food for 25 min and started to get annoyed and asked for it to be boxed up. We didn't like how we were being treated and the workers seemed annoyed by our order. The whole time waiting, we saw a few people came up to complain about their order as well. 

We finally received our food about 30 min later and when we opened it, our food was just thrown into the box. We would have had better service at a McDonalds."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I ordered the build your own hash, chose chorizo and corned beef for my protein, sweet potatoes, mushroom, spinach, corn, poached eggs, topped with cheese and hollandaise sauce... so yummy!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"French toast was amazing and the hash was good too. Cold brew was also very good, only thing is they had several finished tables that weren't cleaned up fast enough we had to sit in one before our food came. Other than that food was great."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is amazing! Had the combo plate, sage sausage was super tasty. Madagascar vanilla coffee was delicious and strong, perfect for a early Saturday morning meet up. The service is great and the people are friendly. Overall awesome place to eat."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is just the kind of casual fast dining experience I was looking for.  Order at the counter, get your own drink, and find a seat for food delivery.  Fast, affordable, and tasty.  This isn't really a brunch spot where you sit and eat and drink slowly for a whole morning.  This is the kind of place you can grab a freshly cooked meal that's a bit out of the ordinary while enjoying people watching and then get on with your day.  I had a sweet breakfast with delicious fruits and nuts!  It really hit the spot before wandering State Street when it opened.  If you're looking for a slow brunch, keep scrolling.  If you're looking for a hearty breakfast, with a California flavor profile, make this your stop."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Service was good. Waiters pretty polite and attentive. Owner was going above and beyond bringing food to cars. 

But French toast was way too eggy. We asked for extra crisp and it was still mushy. 

Also, and absolutely no fault of the restaurant, the sidewalk is a bit narrow and all the imbeciles walking by with no masks made us a bit uncomfortable. So, beware of a slightly stressful brunch."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,When I came here I was way too hungry... well it took about an hour for the food to come. Don't know if it is bad service or a a special tactic to get the customer more hungry so he'll eat more... the food was great tho
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"-$11 for a small breakfast burrito with no sides after a long wait in line to order from an indifferent (at best), guy at the register.
-Forgot to add avocado to my wife's order and brought out a small OJ when we ordered a large.
-Took about 20-25 minutes to get our food.
I don't know why people not only endure it but give it good reviews but I can't."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is the best brunch place in SB!! I went here with my boyfriend, and we both built our own hashes. Mine was sweet potato, corned beef, spinach, corn, mushrooms, eggs, pepperjack cheese, and herb aioli. 

Everything was perfectly cooked. The corned beef was shredded beef. I loved that they put the cheese under the eggs so it could melt into the rest of the hash instead of only on the egg. Their multigrain toast is good, and they give you a light side salad. I thought the portion was good for the amount you paid for. It was a very satisfying meal! 

It's too bad about the location. It's kind of hard to see unless you're looking for it. It's right in between Casablanca and the SB Rock Gym, and the sign is behind some trees. Street parking was easy though :)"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,The restaurant had a  at vibe so we went to try it. We ordered OJ and a coffee TO-GO. The coffee took 35 minutes for just a latte. The OJ was definitely worth it but the wait for a Togo coffee was not. We missed most of our quiet morning walk bc we waited so long. I wish our first experience was better bc we just moved here.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Breakfast date with my hubby on our anniversary weekend. It's a popular place so the wait in line can be long but very very worth it!! It's right on state street with great patio dining. You order at the counter then wait at your table for food. We enjoyed cappuccinos while we waited. Very good espresso! But you have to build your own hash with sweet potatoes! Must must must do this! You won't regret it. You don't even need to add sauce to it. We also shared the Luau French toast which was quite yummy as well. We absolutely loved our hash breakfast! Very fresh ingredients. No grease kitchen here! We highly recommend this place for breakfast.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This was our second time here and I was so was excited to try the French toast but it disappointed. The hash was amazing, OJ excellent, latte ok. Great location with a good SB vibe. We are locals and will keep it in the rotation."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I can't say enough good things about this place. I honestly wasn't expecting a five-star experience but, well, there you have it. It's a simple and yet interesting Concept in that you walk up to the counter to order rather than have a waiter waitress take your order. However the main draw of this place as the ability to customize. It is undoubtedly true that their most popular item is the customizable breakfast hash. Paleo lovers Will Rejoice at the ability to use a sweet potato base but I found the russet potatoes to be very tasty. You choose a potato base  , grab some vegetables , pick a meat  ( includes multiple vegetarian options) customize your eggs, and then decide whether you want any cheese or not. they also give you a slice of their home-baked bread and man does it taste home-cooked. the coffee was also quite delicious and they weren't shy about offering free refills. And just to top things off, the plate came with a side of fresh spring mix. They were cool people who serves delicious food with a great attitude - what's not to love?"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The food was absolutely amazing ! They are a devoted breakfast place that compares to no other ! The breakfast will make you jump out of your seat screaming ""this is delicious""! One thing that sets them apart from most breakfast places is their potatoes, bread, and incredible service. The potatoes are freshly made, incredibly crispy and seasoned perfectly. The bread is made in house, and is a perfect soaking device for the yolk of your perfectly cooked eggs. I was almost done with my food, and the waiter asked me if I wanted some water ! What a nice guy! I definitely suggest eggs bacon avocado and grab a freshly squeezed orange juice while you're at it !"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Might just be the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. The French toast was good, as well."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fabulous breakfast. Both of us got hash. Came with salad and toast. Enough food and nutrition for the whole day. Wish there were one in Santa Rosa.   Good
Music. Great staff."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"What a gem! My husband and I love brunch places and we definitely enjoyed coming here. We came here on a Tues so it was not too busy. I really liked the fact that you can build your own hash dish. Sometimes with build your own stuff places, the dish comes out tasting very generic and premade still but everything I had ordered came together really well and cooked perfectly. They also make their own jam, which was delish!!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is a review for Dawn Patrol ""delivered"". The food was packaged perfectly. They actually take the time to ""plate"" a to-go box vs. just throwing everything in there. They think about things like how their food can be best served when delivered which hardly any other restaurants do. Check out the hollandaise sauce on the side. It's little touches like this that make a great restaurant. The food is always great; been there as well as delivery. Overall a very solid breakfast spot in Santa Barbara that Will certainly survive the infamous state street curse. Great job Dawn Patrol!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"not a bad place for brunch and the wait wasn't too terrible for a Sunday morning. service is really friendly and they have outdoor heaters although they weren't working when I came :( ...It took about 20 minutes to order and 15 for our food to come out

we got some mimosas which were made really well (just wish there was more of it). I also ordered the chorizo hash and subbed out tortillas for bread. SO glad I did because I loved the bread. I'm also a chorizo fan so of course this dish was great although maybe a bit heavy especially for breakfast

my friend ordered the make your own hash and i tried a bite (the sage sausage is fantastic btw) overall this place is a bit pricey for what it is. the menu is rather limited in its selection and I think they raised their prices recently too which is unfortunate"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"A great brunch hangout with a menu versatile enough to keep everyone happy. Hash is the hero of the morning at Dawn Patrol and the servings are gigantic. If potatoes, protein, vegetables, cheese and eggs covered in your choice of sauce is not enough to fill your belly, you are in luck because it comes with toast and garden salad too. 

I am a sucker for huevos rancheros and my plate looked suitable for framing. This gorgeous meal of black beans, tortillas, cheese, red sauce, chips, guacamole and sour cream is a standout dish. Unfortunately the chef botched my over easy eggs and hid some rock hard, burnt eggs inside of the deliciousness of the dish. Tisk Tisk, I would love to give Dawn Patrol 5 stars but the yolk was on me.

Reclaimed wooden walls exploding in colorful striped hues serve as a refreshing wake up call to energize your morning. This is a prefect location for a lazy breakfast after a hot date or to fuel up before hitting the surf. Whatever you plan, remember breakfast is the most important meal of the day."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent build a hash, cool vibe, and large portions.

Their jelly that comes with the toast is super good as well.

Only negs are there is always a long slow line at the register, and it can be really cold inside/outside in the AM."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Good food. A little on the pricey side. $80 for breakfast!
But the service was food. Parking is at REI."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I came here for brunch with my friends while visiting Santa Barbara seven years after graduating from UCSB. It took a minute for us to find a table that could seat a group of six, but we finally managed. We ordered/paid at the front, fast food style, and then our food was brought out to the table. 

I was intrigued by the build your own hash  idea, so that is what I ordered: potatoes with veggie sausage, pepper jack cheese, diced tomatoes, a poached egg, and fire roasted salsa. The hash came with a side of toast and baby greens. The hash was good but not great or impressive enough that I would feel the need to come back next time I'm in SB."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I got the ""build your own hash"" and it was divine! As a vegetarian, it's hard to find a good, filling brunch place, but Dawn Patrol has it all! Good selection of eggs, hash, and yes, even veggie sausage! I was floored with the quality of the food and the good selection of salsas available on the table. Highly recommended!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I love a good eggs benedict just as much as the next person, and wanted to scout out Dawn Patol on my journey to find my favorite brunch spot in SB. 

Food: The food was good, but wasn't anything special. Pretty average, but what was the most disappointing was that my eggs benedict was overcooked. The best part of an eggs benedict is a runny yolk, yet my egg sadly was already set when I cut into it.

Price: Pretty standard prices for a brunch spot but given the quality of the food, it's a little on the pricier end and not super worth it in my opinion.

Service: I expected it to be crowded given that I came on a Saturday afternoon and although the place was decently filled and even with that accounted for, I felt like the service was just off. The woman at the register was a bit condescending when we asked questions regarding the build your own hash and her attitude was also very reflective in her tone of voice when she told us it would be about a 20 minute wait. We agreed to wait, but after the 20 minute mark passed, asked our servers to check in on our food. We were understandably upset when our food came out another 20-30 minutes later and was cold. 

I would come back to give the food another try but until then I hope that they make some changes and improve on the service here."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place has a super cool vibe, really good food and friendly, attentive staff. 
I ordered a custom hash with veggie sausage topped with a delicious fire roasted salsa for breakfast and my husband ordered a waffle with strawberries and bananas. The coffee was really good and they were great about refills and even gave us a to go cup so we could finish our coffee when we left. 
If we lived in Santa Barbara, this place would be a regular stop for us."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Don't begin to understand how they can be rated this highly unless they are ""stuffing the ballot box"" as they say. Very very disappointing. Expensive breakfast...let me rephrase that, VERY expensive breakfast with deep fried bacon. Yes, you read that right. They deep fried their bacon. It was horrible and tasted horrible. I didn't even finish it. Eggs were cooked wrong. And you're right next to the freeway. I'd give it one star but the waiter was decent."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We just happened upon this place. Although we were a bit wary at first, we were pleasantly surprised! The waffle and pancakes were delicious! The breakfast burrito, fire. Huevos rancheros were amazing! All in all just a delicious and great experience"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I loved this place, a perfect place for a vegan to have breakfast.  I had a wonderful sautéed vegetable dish with delicious bread and a side salad.  My friend enjoyed her huge waffle, complete with whipped cream, strawberries and bananas.  We sat outdoors and really enjoyed ourselves.  Great place, with super helpful staff!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"My family and I were on weekend and happen to find this jem. Brunch is the topic  at this place! 
Nephews had some French toast as they described as yummy. I had a mimosa not pictured and the taste was smooth but of course bubbly.
Alcohol  to juice ratio was perfect. The frittatas and potatoes with a side order of hot sauce was the highlight for me. 
Everything taste so fresh and natural. 
The price for the area and food was worth it. Serving size was regular. There are no waiters here in a sense you sit your self and pick what you want than order. But waiters come to serve the food and drinks. Different and that's great! We had a party of 10 so I'm sure we were a handful on our own. Thank you to the waiters and even the cashier for their patience and hospitality 10/10 Birthday girl . Very very friendly and welcoming"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Stopped in this morning because I really needed to answer a few emails while traveling. Had a gluten-free pancake and Whalebird kombucha (my favorite). Staff was super friendly.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The food was amazing! Very fresh. A little overpriced but I would still go back. All of the staff was super friendly and helpful
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,I love Dawn Patrol.  Menu choices and food are great.  Always a bit packed with limited seating.  Plan ahead or get there during off hours.  Coffee is a bit underwhelming.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I love a good breakfast joint with quality food and interesting options. The build-a-hash is a favorite here and it's not hard to understand why. Great portion sizes, veggies perfectly cooked, and a veggie sausage option, and even a healthy side salad standard makes us happy campers. The whipped butter is unsalted, and toast comes unbutteres so be prepared for that. Paying in line up front gives you time to decide what you want, but leaves you free to go when the meal is over. I love efficiency! We came a little after 9 on a Sunday with our toddler and didn't wait long in line. It is now 950, and the line is gone! Only complaints, the water glass smelled a bit of the dish washer, bit I'm picky about water! Also, wifi is slow, so don't expect to do work! Overall, was impressed."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Omg!!!  Super amazing food and coffees!  They even make the breads and orange juice and syrups homemade there!!!  You'd better believe the next time I'm in town, I will be back!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Some will say this is a lengthy review...
It's definitely worth your time...

I was recommended this place as a breakfast spot to try by someone that I knew.

My friend accompanied me to this restaurant on a Monday
It wasn't busy
Their is outside seating with a view of lower state street.
You get to see the many minds of tourists passing by
People watching they call it.

Before I talk about the food
The customer service at this place is theeee best
Encountered in Santa Barbara 
Julio was the guy that helped my friend and I

He asked if we were familiar with the menu
And despite a few other people being behind me in line
He gave the impression It was all about me
Even when I ordered pancakes as a side
He suggested a way ""the sweet choice of my breakfast could be enhanced "" in a curious, fun sort of way..
I went with his suggestion.
""Waffles with banana/ strawberry and syrup...
I'm not sure if they were gluten free
He did talk to me about them
I just said yes..


The chorizo hash special 
Was my main part of my breakfast 
Lightly seasoned 
It was made where the impact of all flavors would survive 
Not what I would say typical chorizo flavor
Which to me is classified as more salty
In comparison to this dish I tried
The texture was similar to southern ""hash""
Experienced with egg and onions, peppers and cheese 
Packaged in a nice medley 
I believe the hash would work well with all populations 
Maybe those wanting more salt would simply have to add
More salt


What they gave was just enough to avoid a stomach ache
Some places give a lot more... 
Unfortunately I have portion control issues 
Likely to eat everything 
So what they did was good
I tasted their pancakes too
I detected a little cinnamon and perhaps a tiny bit of something else.

The waffle had classic waffle flavor
I would have preferred crusty edges instead of soft spongy edges
Nonetheless the flavor complimented the banana and strawberry perfectly..
I looked at how much syrup they gave 
And thought ""I'm going to need much more than that..""
I was wrong
Everything at this restaurant was just enough 

Even when my friend and I were done
They were asking what else could they do to make the last moments good.
I mean every staff member had really good customer service...
They made small talk where I was from and you know..
The usual...
But they did it with a sparkle of care in their eyes 

I will be going back with my brother
And anyone that comes to visit me here in Santa Barbara"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The girls and I drove in early morning from LA, we were looking for a breakfast spot here on Yelp and found Dawn Patrol at the top of the list. Because of their star rating and the vivid, delish pics we had to stop in. What a great choice!!! The place was quaint and  very clean. The customer service was excellent too. 
For me it's hard to find gluten-free options when we go out for meals. I was excited to order the gluten-free pancakes. They were amazing. We had waffle choice of which she was pleased. And the other choice was the Egg white frittata my Aunt raved over the seeded avocado of which was also the star of that dish. Everything was so fresh, delicate, and tasty.  When in Santa Barbara give the guys over at Dawn Patrol a visit."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Ok, let me get started by saying Wow! Incredible build a hash menu, fresh ingredients flavors, they break it down in a selection menu of 5 steps. Start off with a base of russet or sweet potatoes and onions then pick a protein, add your veggies and cheese, then eggs any style, then smother it with 1 of 4 toppings, the holladaise was delicious! 

You have to try the gluten free pancakes incredible with a peach fruit topping and almonds yummy, by the way did I say yummy! Yes I did. 

At state and guitierrez, have a delicious meal here, super friendly and the food is super yummy"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Mixed feelings overall; somewhere between three and four stars...

Be prepared to wait a LONG TIME for food. Well, be prepared to wait a long time in line (45min) before even ordering, and then maybe another 30-40min for your food. Seems that they would benefit from another cashier, another cook, and another runner. 

My husband got a create-your-own hash and thought it was absolutely phenomenal - he couldn't stop raving about that, and he rarely does that. On and on about how the wait was worth it, and I agree - his meal was excellent, filling and savory and all other good things. The whole wheat toast that came with his meal was some of the best bread we've ever had as well. 

I got an egg white frittata - while this would sound healthy, it was super greasy and buttery; there must've been a stick of butter in the pan in which they cooked it. I mean, we're talking oily butterness galore. Regardless, it was perfectly baked; tasty and well-seasoned overall albeit a very small portion for the price. It's a fancy tourist town, so I get that. I wasn't as head-over-heels for my meal as my husband was, but it was still solid and tasty

In addition to the wait, my husband ordered coffee but they never gave it to him till the very end of the meal - we had to ask three times. In addition, the table staff were very scattered, not particularly attentive to us but much more attentive to the tables around us. 

A good place overall; ultimately would recommend the create-your-own hash thing and getting your caffeine beforehand as you settle in for the wait."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I had the gluten free pancakes. They were spendy, as everything in this town is. They were light and filling. My wife had breakfast combo and said it was her favorite breakfast so far on our trip. Would recommend to anyone."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,I love a good egg Benedict but I do t always trust a place to make a good one. I asked the server here what he preferred between eggs Benedict and a chorizo dish and he said those for both his top two favorite and I couldn't go wrong. So I got the eggs Benedict. Perfect choice.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This spot was quite good! We decided to head on over the morning of the Fourth of July and as anticipated, it was quite busy. The wait was probably about 20 minutes just to order, as this is a place where you wait in line to order, get a number, find a seat, and then the food is brought out to you. We didn't mind the wait, as there were menus that you could take a look at, and when you got closer to the door, there's a huge menu up on the wall to look at. I'd wager that the line takes really long because there is a ""Build Your Own Hash"" option that has about 5 different steps, so if the people ahead of you aren't prepared, then this takes a while to build it at the register. There are tons of other delicious options too, like pancakes, benedicts, egg plates, etc. with some coffee options. 

The food was quite good, well-seasoned and came out in a reasonable amount of time after the initial, long wait. The reason why I give only 4 stars is because the line and the process of getting people's orders and food to them could definitely be enhanced, if only by adding another register or someone helping out by taking orders on paper and then getting it to the register so that things went a bit more quickly. We also didn't get the correct coffee drinks that we asked for (they were made with soy milk without having asked for soy milk), but we didn't want to return them because it already took about as long to get our drinks as it did to get our food. People also clog up the seating area by going and snagging a table while someone else waits in line, and that defeats the entire purpose of this restaurant model, so there were definitely times where people had to stand around waiting. An enforcement on having people wait until they have an order placed to be seated would help. 

Other than that, this place is good, but it is definitely on the pricey side (about $14 on average for a plate)."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So this was originally Beachbreak but they sold and it became Dawn Patrol. We were sad about that, but decided yesterday to give this place a try.

At first its a touch confusing, since the way you order isn't how I'm accustomed, but we both decided to create a scramble. Since some of the ingredients weren't explained, we guessed on a few things.

My boyfriend tried regular potatoes, corned beef, scrambled eggs on top with salsa. It was terrific, and I only had a bite! (That's all he'd let me take) I decided to jump in feet first and got sweet potatoes with corned beef, scrambled eggs and aioli sauce on top as an experiment. It was amazing, but I will mention to anyone reading should they try this combo, its a touch sweet. Amazing, and I'd order it again, hands down, but sweet.

Even the side salad they include is tasty, lightly tossed with a sweet dressing. The bread that comes with was large, light and toasted in some different way that left it crunchy and soft. My only wish is that they would give you more butter and jam with your bread, as the amount we got was enough for only one piece of bread. The portions otherwise were great!

Ordered an iced coffee and it was great despite no creamer-the half and half and milk sufficed with cute sugar cubes. Much less busy than before, which was nice, but steady business. Service was good, food came out fast!

The price was a bit higher than what I'd have liked to pay but this is Santa Barbara, its a short walk to the beach from the location, so -you know! Two scrambles, 20% tip, an iced tea and iced coffee put us back $40, but it was food worth eating =)

As for portions, I ate my whole dish and was stuffed. I think the portion is large enough to satisfy a normal appetite, but not too large to ensure people are packing it up and taking it home.

Will definitely eat here again, and look forward to trying different scrambles!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"It was our 1st time visiting this cozy restaurant. Food was amazing and delicious.
 But the best part is costumer service. I can't express my gratitude how attentive waitress was. They even ask if your pups would like some water that was super cool.
Highly recommend to everyone."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Hooo boy, did we get there at a good time. I was worried about having to wait in line for awhile, but we got there as there were still plenty of seats available and walked right up to order. By the time we were almost done eating, the line was out the door and wrapped around the outside patio. So, tip: We got there at about 9am on a Sunday morning. The line started to form around 10-10:30. Get there earlier!

This was a spontaneous find on our last day in Santa Barbara. I really enjoyed the fun, laid back SoCal vibe. (I know, everyone seems to say that Santa Barbara is ""central"" but it will always be Southern to me.) It was a fun atmosphere and our food came pretty quickly. My only complaint would be that I wish they'd manage the seating a little better. We got there early enough that it wasn't an issue, but as we were eating, we watched several people go save seats well before they ordered - pretty far back in the line. It drives me nuts when people do that - wait until you order, people!! (We have a place up here in Seattle that will not allow you to sit down until you've ordered and have a number. You order, get your number, and then they have someone help you find a seat. It works surprisingly well at keeping things moving and getting people to seats by the time their food comes out. When people run ahead to hog seats, it messes up the rhythm.)

ANYWAY. Again, I totally forget what my husband got. But I got the huevos rancheros (because I have to get them at least once while in ""SoCal."") They were delicious. I would go back in a heartbeat. I really dig the name, too - ""Dawn Patrol"". :)"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Monday morning and it was even still a bit busy, but the line moved quickly. Great hash: russets, bacon, spinach, tomatoes, cheddar, over medium eggs and salsa. We shared and it was enough food...just enough. Mimosa was fantastic."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Dawn Patrol has a casual, surfer themed interior with delicious brunch options. Sporting a focused, yet customizable menu, Dawn Patrol can cater to picky eaters and solidly deliver on breakfast fundamentals.

I highly recommend the breakfast hash, which I customized with Bacon, Scrambled Eggs, Spinach and Mushrooms and was delighted to find it fresh, well cooked, and seasoned properly.

Located on lower state, Dawn Patrol is front and central to all things beach in Santa Barbara. Next time you hit the waves, stop in for a breakfast burrito!

MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I really liked this spot. Service was great, food was good, parking is located in the rear."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We love it here! Great coffee, delicious food and friendly service. The Build a Hash plate was unreal and the gluten free pancakes hit the spot. We will be back soon and they even take the Axxess card!!!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great find. Nice staff.  Great food. 
Lots of creativity on the menu and with the create your own omelette the choices are unlimited. 
We split a build your own plus a pancake which was fluffy and tasty. 

Oh. The latte was yummy. 

Enjoy!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great place for breakfast. Awesome food and close to the beach, bike rentals and the train station. Prices as expected for a tourist town like Santa Barbara. But not too outrageous."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"This is one of those places that is more hype than delivery. I will admit the vanilla latte was one of the best I've ever had and the cute bear in the foam was a great touch... But the breakfast itself is just OK, and their unwillingness to make any exceptions is kind of ridiculous. I've never wanted a green salad with my breakfast, nor will I ever. They treat butter like it is gold... I had to ask for it more twice because they will only give you 1 pat of butter at a time. It was amusing to watch people walk up and ask for more butter the entire time we were there. The management needs to know they are wasting more time going back and getting more butter than just giving people a reasonable amount of butter to begin with."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I came back for more! Last time I was in town, I stumbled upon Dawn Patrol and was thoroughly impressed and satisfied with the food, service and overall experience. 

Their build-your-own-hash is a ""must get!"" First, you choose from russet potatoes or sweet potatoes, which are sautéed with peppers and onion. 2nd, select a protein: chicken, ham, corned beef (+$2), salmon (+$2), applewood bacon, sage sausage or veggie sausage. 3rd, as many different veggies they have (avo is +$2) and cheddar or pepper jack cheese. 4th, choose your preferred style of eggs & 5th, sauce/gravy/salsa!
Yes, this dish can add up if you get the mark-up ingredients and it's an extra $5 if you want an additional protein! However, you will not be disappointed with the quality of the ingredients, seasoning and quantity. Their green salad is a nice added touch too! 

Their Luau French Toast using their housemate Hawaiian bread was fluffy and delicious. Loved that they paired it with fresh fruit as well. 

They have a great selection of beverages from different coffee, teas, kombucha, sodas, beer and wine! 

Dog friendly! 
Street parking can be a challenge."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The four of us had a great breakfast here this morning. The men loved the ""build your own hash"" concept while the women ordered huevos rancheros. Both were excellent and everybody was happy.  (Not easy to do). The coffee was organic and lovely. The cappuccino was perfect.  The owner(?) manager (?) was so gracious and the staff couldn't have been any more accommodating. Great spot for breakfast, coffee.  Highly recommend!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I had brunch here on Saturday and I was pretty disappointed. Food was nothing spectacular, and the customer service was lackluster. Once we ordered food, we looked for a place to sit but there were so many dirty, uncleared tables...so we had to ask for one to be cleaned off. That took almost 10min. Then, our food wasn't delivered to the table for almost 30min. It was a lot of waiting for some OK food. My french toast was extremely plain...I could have ordered the same french toast from Denny's. The only redeeming thing was the frittata; really enjoyed this. Otherweise, everything else was just alright. I don't think I would try Dawn Patrol when I'm in town again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Casual atmosphere, decent prices food was good, simple  and as described. Staff tentative. Dog friendly. Outside patio."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Options aplenty to please our group-- a picky kid, a vegetarian, someone in the middle of a Whole30, and an eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast breakfast traditionalist. Food was tasty and service was attentive but not in your face. Everyone enjoyed their food-- two build your own hashes, a breakfast burrito, eggs and pancakes, and the afore mentioned traditional brekkie. Herb aioli was a high point! Would definitely return."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I feel like it's hit or miss at this place but I've been fortunate to order things I like that come out perfect (others I've been there with, not so much), but I love that it's got healthy options and a fun location. When it's busy, your order can take a while as others noted, but if you're there like I often was, to do work as well as eat, that wasn't a big deal to me at the time. Great spot for weekend brunches."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"When we arrived there was a huge line and there is only one person working the register who is also taking phone orders. So the line was already an annoying experience.

Then I went to order a burger on wheat bread and lettuce w dressing on the side. He said since I made these adjustments it will take longer. 

Ummm ok, I'm asking u to put dressing on the side and it takes longer than tossing it.

So far I've been waiting 25 minutes for my breakfast and nothing has come out yet"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The food was really fresh n good n it was fast too  I order the build your own hash n eggs it was really yummy n the Eggs Benedict was tasty too really good place to have breakfast
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The food was decent...however many of the items are no longer offered. The didn't have corned beef or any of the pastries, and the lemon whipped cream for the Luau French Toast is not offered anymore. The service was mediocre, the staff kept forgetting to bring out things; water, coffee, and instead of whipped cream they brought us butter?!? You also need to battle for a table after you order which makes it hard to plan your meal."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The hash, single OJ, single coffee and single pancake we ordered were tasty but not exceptional for the $40+ we spent. The wait time of nearly an hour was excessive. In fact, the couple behind us decided to game the system by calling their order in from the line. Clever, huh? The kicker is, there's only one order taker so he answers the phone to take their order thereby holding up everyone else in line. In addition, our overall experience was marred by people saving tables while friends waited in line. 
I hope management makes some changes but there are too many other breakfast options in SB for me to return."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Easy going breakfast spot. Food is very good and service is great. Tables are spaced out well on the patio, and dogs are allowed."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"very fresh ingredients used. Made my own mix, sweet potatoes, chicken and eggs. didn't like the salad that it came with for breakfast simply because it was a breakfast item i had ordered early in the am but the mix itself was good. quality food, facility was clean, well put together and all the employees were very nice."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Seriously!! After reading the reviews also we went out of our way to find this place circling several times because of one way streets and parking was terrible. Finally parked and walked over to find out it is temporarily CLOSED! Dawn patrol you need to UODATE your info so that people are not wasting their time!!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The avocado toast is SUPERB!!! The employees were very nice too. Love this place. Would visit again.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We love this place. The interior is cheerful. The bathrooms are whimsical. Most importantly, the food is delicious! We split a hash with soft scrambled eggs, russet potatoes, bacon and a host of veggies like mushrooms, onions and diced tomatoes. A small side salad accompanied our cheddar topped hash. But that's not all! We split an order of French Toast with thick, soft Hawaiian bread. It was served with lemon butter and maple syrup with powdered sugar sprinkled on top. Love Dawn Patrol and recommend it highly."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Outstanding great food good people. Get the build a hash make this your breakfast stop while in Santa Barbara
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Freshly squeezed O.J., Eggs Benedict and Reggae ... what better way to start the day?

This is more of a hip kind of place with very friendly service, fun decor, and and your regular beach customers.  The menu has a nice variety with a little twist.  I was interested to try their make-your-own hash bowls.  However, the Eggs Benedict was tempting me too much.  

A couple of other pluses: bathroom and restaurant is very clean; parking is nearby, and when you order you get to pick your own emoji for the table rather than an order number."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"As a celiac, this is my favorite breakfast in Santa Barbara. Eaten here several times with no issues after alerting them of a gluten allergy. Bottomless iced coffee, too."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Delicious breakfast. Excellent coffee. Great fresh squeezed Orange Juice too. My husband and I went in for a late breakfast. Restaurant closes at 2. We were there before one. Food was excellent. Service , so so. Would definitely recommend, and would go again. Just felt like they were more interested in getting prepared to close, than wait on any more customers. Go earlier!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Some of the best Brunch I've had in town! Our waiter Coen was an excellent server and very polite and friendly. He checked in on us regularly to make sure we had plenty of coffee and such. The atmosphere was great and the staff overall is very friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone who has not gone.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,One of the best breakfast place ever from fresh ingredients to fresh orange juice. The hash was to die for.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Food was super yummy! The boyfriend got their eggs Benedict and had nothing but great things to say about it, but did say that the bread they put it on is ok and he would have preferred the standard English muffin. Hence the 4 out of 5 stars. I got the chorizo hash and it was AMAZING! Boyfriend said it was the best chorizo he has had in a long time. If your looking for a good cozy little breakfast spot this is a great spot!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I ordered the prisoner egg muffin ($8) and it was amazing. It's made with scallions, corn and jalapeño and the egg is cooked soft boiled, surrounded by a layer of herb cream cheese....so bomb!!! Also comes with a small side salad. I also got a side fruit salad ($5) and I am so impressed with the portion size!!! Restaurants like to scam you and charge $5 for 3 pieces of cantaloupe but not Dawn Patrol!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"For a starter, this is not American as Yelp tells for this restaurant. This is a Mexican restaurant serving American food.

Looking for an all American breakfast and this yelp (restaurant owners) not mentioning it anywhere is not right and misleading.

Food was made with old reused oil, and pretty much all the food smelled that clearly shows food were made with low quality, cheap and old, reused products in the food."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Breakfast at Dawn Patrol was quite good.  I had the pleasure of eating their french toast.  The decaf coffee was a tad plain.  But the great service made up for that minor detail.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fresh ingredients, large portion sizes, friendly, young staff. Young restaurant, for that matter! 

Seat yourself, stand in line to order, then they bring the food out to you. The line can get prettyy long on a Sat. or Sun. 'round noon, try to get here before that if you can, rest up for this one. They specialize in build-your-own hash, and we all know how long weighing the opportunity cost of Swiss cheese over jack cheese can take. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day after all and I for one do not want to wind up like Anne Hathaway in les Miserables b.c. I made a dumb call on my hash toppings. 
...anyways, wouldn't recommend the herb sauce (green one) that's optional to put on top, strongly recommend the mimosas, and hope this place continues to do well(:"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place is straight up fire. I got the build your own hash and honestly the best I've ever had. Excellent service and teamwork from Kevin and Coen. Will eat here again and will recommend.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So yummy! We are locals and arrived when there was no line. They offered us a paper menu and to find out seat. A few minutes later there were 20 people in line. We offered our table to a large group so they could all fit then went to wait in line to order. We were very hungry and the line was moving slowly, so we slowly made our way out of the line to head elsewhere. Javier (busboy) saw us leaving and knew we had been there for awhile so they offered to take our order and get us seated. Amazing service!

We orders huevos rancheros (my Mexican boyfriend says they were delish!), a small portion of the Hawaiian bread French toast wth pineapple butter, and I had a custom hash. We also orders fresh squeezed OJ which was actually fresh squeezed! 

This place is our new favorite ;) thank you Dawn Patrol!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Rad place, pretty good food, a little expensive.  They screwed up my order with a buddy's, and when we pointed it out, they took the food away to fix it.  It turns out that they just scraped the hollandaise and eggs off of each hash and put it on the right one.  Experience was 3 to 3 1/2 stars IMO, but I could see it easily having been a 4 or a 5."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Terrible service! The food is alright and comes fast. Our drinks on the other hand wouldn't have came to our table is we wouldn't have had asked 5 (!) times for them! Tipp: Pay for your food/drinks only and give tips after service!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is the only breakfast spot I choose to go to whenever I am in SB or drive by because it's so delicious. I started coming here four years ago and it never gets old. Also, Julio is awesome. Thanks Dawn Patrol!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Exceptionally good breakfast, friendly staff and nice outdoor seating in a semi-private location. Would absolutely return!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great food and amazing service! They have great and very flavorful hash. I love the build your own hash because you can put whatever you want in it, and all of the ingredients are fresh and cooked so perfectly together. The eggs on top were flawlessly poached too!  Chorizo hash is also great! Definitely will be coming here again. Excellent coffee cake and drinks too."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Finally got the opportunity to try dawn patrol recently and experience was great! The last time we were in Santa Barbara we had a difficult time finding the restaurant because it's unpretentious and tucked next door to Casa Blanca Restaurant. One way street on Gutierrez Street, made visibility difficult. If we hadn't parked across the street on Sevilla Square, we would have missed them again. Free parking up to 75 minutes here.

The restaurant is small, but offers casual friendly space and outdoor patio. Beach surf decor compliments the space well. It's semi-casual dining, you order at the counter and food is brought to your table. The restaurant offers a good selection of breakfast and brunch items. There claim to fame is their ""build-your-own-hash!"" which allows you to customize your hash any way you (choice of regular potato or sweet potato hash with pepper amd onions) with choice of proteins, vegetables, sauces (hollandaise, gravy, salsa and aioli) and eggs any style.

We went with the chorizo-hash special and built our own hash (russet potatoes, bacon, spinach, mushroom, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and scramble eggs topped with hollandaise sauce). It was delicious and hearty breakfast indeed. Hash is actually prepared country style as opposed to shredded. Lightly crisp on outside and tender inside. Everything was so flavorful and fresh. The hash and scramble eggs was cooked perfectly, highlight was hollandaise sauce which made it so luscious. The chorizo-hash was fantastic and best I've had in long time. Good coffee too...wish it was free refills.

Both dishes and coffee ended costing us $37 which was too bad. Our order did take a while to arrive (30 min), but overall fabulous meal."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Wonderful breakfast and great service.  We had the ""Make a Hash.""  I wish I lived in Santa Barbara.  I would eat here all the time.  Wonderful setting with lots of outside dining."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Such friendly, prompt service and yummy food! Try the made-to-order breakfast hash with lots of options (sweet potatoes as the base!) and eggs prepared any way you like. Homemade sage sausage patties were fantastic! Order at the counter and they'll bring it to your table. Outdoor seating as well."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We were pleasantly surprised to secure a table for the Sunday brunch time period. We found a two seater outside. It was a bit chilly, but a fun place to take in the flowers, sunshine, and some people watching. Unfortunately, I forgot a mask before we left home, so I sat outside while my friend ordered for us. The line moved somewhat slow, but it didn't take too long for our order to come out. A waiter poured us water as we waited. The bathrooms are cute and clean, but the lock on one of them seemed busted? It may have just been a personal issue figuring out how to lock it, but the 2nd bathroom worked fine. 

I got the Patrol Combo with bacon (super crispy), eggs over easy (cooked perfectly), and wheat toast (they haven't done scones since before covid, boo!). It came with butter and tasty, tart jelly for the toast and warm, herby breakfast potatoes. I ate it all, and it was a satisfying, classic breakfast! I will say the price is a touch expensive for the type of breakfast I can cook myself (I usually see this type of combo priced below $10). My friend got the French Toast, which came with a side of fruit (about half was melon). She really enjoyed her meal!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Thw food is delicious I recommend the chorizo plate it's the bomb, also try the Patrol combo 13  ufffr delicious anf the staff are friendly and helpful,"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Laid back qwerky atmosphere with friendly staff and amazing food.  I had the buckwheat pancakes and my wife had the State St salad.  Both were the best we can remember tasting.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Can I start with the bathroom? I love a restaurant that makes their brand plain in a good way in the bathroom. I like the decor.
OK, for the food. The make your own hash part of the menu is genius. The first time out with regular idaho potatoes and corn beef was a tad dry.
The next time we got the sweet potatoes with corned beef and added tomatoes and other things that I have forgotten. It was moist and delicious and I aspire to re-create its awesomeness.
I love the location, right by the climbing wall and by a gym. Right around the corner from REI. The outdoor seating is great with people bringing kids and dogs. It's just a happy scene to walk through. 
You order at the counter, so if you're meeting with friends you don't have to fight over the check or starve while you wait for them. Get there, order, and they can do the same when they arrive. 
I've been twice and I can't wait to go back and work on my search for perfecting my hash!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"OMG! I'm from So cal so 1st time here and Honestly this has been by far the best breakfast experience I've ever had. If I can give 6 stars I would. Excellent excellent. If there are any bad reviews about this place. It's bc the person giving the bad review is a shit bag. 

Build ur own hash. Corned beef add bacon!! Pepper jack. Avocado a must. I got both the salsa and aioli sauce on the side. Fucking fantastic.  Get the French toast to share. Need the sweet tooth    Only thing missing is a blood Mary to start. Amazing spot"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"aesthetic: 3.5/5
food: 5/5
service: 3.5/5 

i came to dawn patrol w a friend for a post-hike brunch, and we really enjoyed our meal here!! we both got the build-your-own-hash -- my friend's scrambled egg topping was made perfectly, and my veganized version (veggie sausage) was so crispy and had a really delish, not-overly-meaty-salty flavour to it. it was the right amount of food too, and we left feeling a good, not overly-stuffed kinda full :) 

ambiance-wise, there's lots of seating and a cute, tropical vibe corner with giant plant decor (of course, we had to pick that area to sit in lol). there was a line out the door when we came around 11, but it moved quickly and we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. 

i would have loved to see more vegan options on the menu, like vegan pancakes, but for this one vegan item that dawn patrol has, it'll definitely please your tastebuds!! with the super fast service and affordable + yummy brunch options for every diet (gluten free pancakes, anyone?), dawn patrol is so worth checking out!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great! The build your own breakfast hash was really awesome! Large portion and great flavor! The only bummer was I ordered two meats for mine and it came with one in the hash and the side of ham just as a slice on an extra plate which was a little strange. Will definitely try it again though!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Love the food and every time I come back from out of town I get the same amazing quality I've the past 6 years.  Highly recommend!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Hands down, the best breakfast I have ever had. Great service and very clean. Can't wait to come
back next time I am in town."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The 'create your own hash' breakfast was delicious! Great service! even though it was packed, they still brought coffee refills to us, even though it is more of an order-at-the-counter type of casual restaurant. I would definitely go there again next time I'm in SB!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Amazing homemade jelly and toast! Also can't forget the custom hashs. Super tasty! Found this place last week and have been back twice since then. Also very friendly staff and nice outside seating.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Delicious food and excellent service from Julio and the team.  Our favorite part though was the blazing fast WiFi.  Wow what a great experience.  Highly recommended!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Very good breakfast. I got the make your own hash and spicy chai. Everything was really good, even the toast with homemade jalapeno jam. The portion was a little big for just one. Could be shared."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We wanted to have a sumptuous breakfast before we start our drive to San Francisco, stopped by at this place on a Sunday morning. It was super crowded and long waits is what you should expect. It's seems to be a popular family breakfast spot. We were super hungry having an active start to the day, were exhausted by the time we got our food on our table. But totally worth the wait. 

Place cleanliness: Good
Quality of food: Excellent 
Quality of service: It was slow, since it was a busy day, but the staff were friendly.
Ambience: Average
Price for quality: Excellent
Things that I liked: Egg White Fritters and Gluten Free pancakes  
Suggestions:"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Right in the heart of downtown on state street. Very tasty and crowded for breakfast. I recommend. Expect to wait 20 mins for food and a line to order!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Good food but a long wait to order. On busy hours, you guys should have to registers, or since you use square pos, use an iPad pos and take orders from people in line. Would improve the experience a ton."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Dawn patrol is a order sit style restaurant it's a cool little restaurant lots of bright colors. The menus a little tricky at first but they have sweet yams great tasting gravies and fresh squeezed orange juice. My experience was great.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Came here for breakfast with my son and ordered the egg white frittata and a gluten free pancake. Both were delicious. Would definitely come back here for breakfast!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"So awesome, this place.  Loved the breakfast hash, the fresh coffee, the kids meals, the friendly people and the laid back surfer vibe."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Such a cute breakfast spot! I had the egg white frittata which came with a half avocado covered in seeds and strawberries. The frittata had potatoes inside which added a nice different texture :-) My BF got a salmon omelette which he really enjoyed too!
Great seating inside and out. Very convenient to the beachfront hotels on State Street!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great find.  I had the chorizo hash, my wife had the frittata scramble.  Both were outstanding.  Service was great.  My only complaint is the coffee could have been better.  It tasted watered down meaning the don't use the correct grind and/or water ratio.   Fix that and itd be 5 stars."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Dawn Patrol was a late minute breakfast choice and it didn't disappoint!  Had the 3 egg frittata w/ half of a seeded avocado and it was so good.  Just enough food and the chai tea was delicious.  Hubbie had the hash w/ sweet potato and chicken and he loved it.  If you are in Santa Barbara, near state street it is a definite break spot.  Dog friendly and mimosas!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fast, friendly and helpful service! Food was fresh and great quality. Portion size was reasonable enough where I didn't leave too much left overs. Pricing was a little on the high side I'd say tho. Got the hash and I liked how it can be easily personalized. I got the vanilla latte and I'd say it was pretty average. Overall, I'd come again!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Omg. Simply perfection. What a place to sit and enjoy breakfast after time on the water!

Greeted by the sweetest young man that filled my personal cup with cold brew. 

Hubby had the French toast. 

I had the frittata. 

Both AMAZING!

Seating inside and patio. 

We will be back!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We stumbled upon Dawn Patrol while walking around trying to find a place for breakfast. You order at the counter and then find a table and wait. Luckily, when we got there the line wasn't too bad, which also gave us some time to look over the menu and make our final decisions. Upon ordering you are given an emoji instead of a number, which was a cute touch. However, not sure how efficient their ordering system is because it took a while to get our food. We both ordered hashes and added avocado. I will say that I was a a little bummed out about paying $2 extra for not even half an avocado. The salsa and custom hash concoction itself was pretty tasty! We also received butter and strawberry jam with our toast. I ordered the white toast which was great dipped in runny egg yolk, but with butter and jam it tasted like a dessert. While the strawberry jam didn't pack a lot of strawberry flavor, it really transformed my white toast into a sweet treat."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"One of my favorite spots for brunch in Santa Barbara.  We were nervous about finding a spot to accommodate our group of 8, but the staff was so nice and friendly, moving tables to make sure we were all comfortable.  My group couldn't decide what was the best meal that was ordered that day (I think I won though with the chorizo hash). Highly recommend this spot!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,The food was excellent...everything we wanted from our breakfast. The unfortunate part was apparently an employee called in sick and the only way I knew that was because the manager was yelling at the kitchen staff. I was left feeling full of tension and the meal was uncomfortable. Some things should be done and handled in private.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Service- awesome, they don't have servers, you order up at the counter and they bring your food out to your table.  Instead of table numbers you get to choose your own emoji 

Food- wife got classic breakfast and was into it.  Potatoes were so good.  I got the ground beef chilaquiles special and it was incredible - hope they add that to the menu.  

Icing on the cake - free iced coffee refills and fresh squeezed OJ.  When I went to get a coffee refill there was a longish line ordering food - one of them noticed me abandon the refill and walk back to my seat and came out 30s later with another one!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,This place is so good. The sweet potato hash is amazing. Iced latte is pretty good too. One of my frequent brunch stops for sure
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Hadn't been here since it changed names. Really good ""build your own hash"" with sweet potatoes and almost too much bacon. Delish and plenty of leftovers. Plus they take Axxess! Service was next to perfect!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,I have been going to SB for the past 5 years and I finally got a chance to visit Dawn Patrol. The Madagascar latte is DELICIOUS! And their hash dishes are worth every cent.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"best pancakes i've ever had !! 
nice environment, great staff, but most important was the pancakes"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"First time here. Nice setup on inside, family friendly. Our baby stroller was one of a few parked around tables.

The coffee is super fresh, OJ is fresh squeezed in front of you and the food we had was awesome! I had the chorizo hash, seasoned to perfection! They give you 3 corn tortillas with it which is a very nice touch. The potatoes in this hash soak up all the seasonings and the juice from the chorizo making them some of the best potatoes I've ever eaten. Well done!

My wife got the breakfast sando. I asked her how it was a couple times, she held up her finger telling me to wait, next thing I know her sandwich is gone. Any questions as to its deliciousness? 

Highly recommend this place!! You won't be disappointed."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"One of our new favorite brunch spots. We were absolutely blown away by this place. We got the build your own hash, and it was a great amount of food. But the all star...the house made jelly to go with the toast. I almost cried with how amazing it was.

*Update* The place is just as good the second time!!! I still cried when I ate the toast with the house made jam."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The service was great.  Appreciated the fact the Gent behind the counter read off the ingredients of the ""veggie"" sausage which ended up being a no go for me.  Our food was delish and great coffee.  Would definitely come again!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Still dreaming about the breakfast I ate here a couple of weekends ago. My husband found this place on Yelp and his go to breakfast item is always some kind of a hash on the menu. Of course when he found this and saw it was build your own hash we were determined this was a must try. Omgggg the breakfast was soo good. My favorite part was the coffee cake that was served warmed up. I believe it was a strawberry banana chocolate chip creation. It was to die for. Not too sweet or overbearing but the perfect blend of everything. Next time we are back in SB we are going here again!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great breakfast spot- excellent service and great food.. I did a build your own hash and they let me sub items because of being vegetarian. They even made the hash in oil vs butter, and best thing is they didn't make me feel like a pain, in fact they had tons of suggestions to make it vegan. Great coffee.  Great food.  Highly recommend this spot for breakfast."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent food! My new husband and I ate here not once but TWICE while we were in Santa Barbara for our honeymoon (we were only there for 2 days before continuing our road trip, so we did breakfast at Dawn Patrol on both days). Make sure to try the fresh orange juice!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Top choice for breakfast in Santa Barbara. Top quality ingredients creatively combined. They can get super busy so patience is advised. You customize your hash. Delicious. The co-manager, Coen, is very attentive, polite and professional. I ordered at the counter but he gave me full table service! Well worth any brief wait in line."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Fresh, homemade fare, served by friendly and professional hosts. French toast on homemade bread- better than expected- and I expect good. Will be back. Cuisine is very well presented and prepared."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Maybe just the best breakfast I've ever had... beyond words. & a must try for the Santa Barbara world of cuisine.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"What a treasure...fantastic food, super super kind & attentive service, homemade jam, soooooo good!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Very solid, quality breakfast/lunch place open until 2PM. Service is professional and pretty friendly. Decor is a somewhat of a surfer dude/Mexican/slight Hawaiian vibe to it- unique and relaxed. It does tend to get crowded pretty fast- and long lines are not uncommon . But the drink and food menus are very extensive and definitely worth a visit."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"OMG, soo yummy. Full build your breakfast. The line goes quickly and no one tries to rush you. Parking was an issue but we used REI since they were closed that early. One day we'll be back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"As I'm writing this review, the guy walks up to my table to refill my coffee and says ""Did you drop this $10 bill?"". Yes, I did. Dude!  What a rad place. I love breakfast, okay?  I'm a breakfast person.  This is MY FAVORITE local spot for breakfast.  If you like fresh, flavorful, and healthy California food, get here quick.  If there's a line, wait!  Once you're in here though, there's no rush to leave. The vibe is laid back, the music sounds niiice, and even the bathrooms are fun to be in (ever seen a wall made up of chopped up skateboard decks?!).  Breakfast solo or with a close friend can be found no where better than this."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place wasn't what we expected! It kept popping up for breakfast and is close to where we were staying so we decided to try it out. The general manager was very friendly and helpful, although he took a little while to take our order. We liked the counter service though, it made it fun and casual. 

My husband built his own hash, and it was really really good! I got the luau French toast and the whipped lemon butter was to die for! We felt it was a tad overpriced, but that might just be because we are cheap! 

For a Wednesday morning, it was a little slow, but the next time we are in Santa Barbara, we'll definitely be coming back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I paid a visit to Dawn Patrol on a recent Saturday afternoon and was more than pleasantly surprised at this gem of a spot. 2 key things stood out to me: the quality food amongst a casual atmosphere, and the exceptional service. Coen and Ryan took my order and served my every need with pride and a friendly demeanor. Thank you, Coen, for the amazing vanilla latte - delicious to the last drop! And thank you, Ryan, for the ordering guidance with a smile. A truly exceptional experience, and I can't wait to go back when I'm in town again. Time to spread the word about this place!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Perfect pancakes! The build your own hash is genius. I'd come here regularly if I could!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great lunch! We came here on a Monday so it wasn't too busy. We sat out on the patio to enjoy a little bit of sun. 

Service was super friendly and they were great with recommendations. I had the burger and my husband ordered the chorizo scramble. Both were delicious. My burger came with a light salad (you could also choose fries). It was full of flavor and just the right amount of food. The scramble was great, it was a special that day so be sure to check the board to see if they have it. 

They have a help-yourselves-water-station which was great. They have water glasses and glass bottles that you can grab to refill at the table. 

The location is fantastic, right at the end of the main stretch of State Street and very close to the beach."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Avoid this place: cashier (who I'm sure was the owner) had no personality and hesitated to give us back our complete change due to not having .75 cents in quarters. My wife rummaged through her purse really quick and offered to give him .22 cents to receive a dollar back and he said ""oh.. sorry.."" Pathetic! Aside from that, it was way overpriced, food was cold and took FOREVER to arrive at our table, and they never once offered to refill my coffee. 

What good is ""organic"" food if it arrives cold to your table? We come to Santa Barbara once a year and I will definitely 100% SKIP this place in the future."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"It was our 1st time visiting this cozy restaurant. Food was amazing and delicious.
 But the best part is costumer service. I can't express my gratitude how attentive waitress was. They even ask if your pups would like some water that was super cool.
We will be Definitely coming back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,What a wonderful hidden gem. The food is amazing and the coffee is the best around. The organic french roast is dark and flavorful. So smooth. The Madagascar vanilla bean latte was perfection. I had the eggs benedict and  hollandaise sauce was so creamy and wonderful. This is my go to breakfast spot in santa barbara. Staff is amazing.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Bottom Line: Good breakfast!

My family came here after I did the last Santa Barbara Tri and I was hungry.  As in, i'll take that, that, that and that... and are you done with that - hungry.

I had a protein shake, eggs benedict, potatoes, pancakes, bacon and the family shared a little with me.

Everything was good - all of the food was a little different as Im sure that they want to stand out from the breakfast crowd a bit but not so far off that it was weird.

I love the skate art and skate walls that around inside - very creative use of these things so big thumbs up for that.

The service was good as well which is great.  My son spilled the shake and they promptly brought one right out to replace it - very classy move there.

Over all I really like this place!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Ordered two items, french toast and breakfast burrito. French toast was great fluffy and tasted good. Breakfast burrito was not good, needs to be completely rethought. Basically a burrito filled with undrained black beans, was not good."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Awesome service . Awesome food . The huevos rancheros was delicious. I will definitely be coming back when I come to Santa Barbara . Just awesome overall .
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Coffee isn't very good, and the food is average at best. Pricey and disappointing."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This was honestly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had in my life! The build a hash was perfect, and everything about it was delicious. The toast was amazing and the jam they serve is incredible. Not to mention the impeccable service.  This is easily the best breakfast spot in Santa Barbara."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Dawn Patrol is great. We stopped there for brunch on the way up the coast. Great beachy environment with really friendly staff. We both did the build your own hash and it may have been the best breakfast I've ever had. Fairly priced for more than enough food. I highly recommend this to anyone interested. The whole experience was great!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"This place was okay, good but overpriced. I should have gotten the build your own hash, which was my mistake, but I did get the huevos rancheros. It was not memorable, I honestly did not really enjoy it. I thought it was very flat in flavor, everything tasted the same, texture was all the same. I also got a cup of coffee, quite expensive and oddly watery. I don't know why it was so watery considering it was a cold brew, but I would not get the coffee again. I would come back but maybe to try the hash, definitely not the huevos rancheros. The customer service really sold me though, the cashier was the sweetest and so were the servers. We were not neglected at any point and I felt comfortable there!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Came her on a Sunday around 11:30, must've hit the rush because it took us almost a half hour in line before we were able to order. The Chorizo Hash special was great, a little kick and very filling. The Patrol Combo was only ok, a little bland. 

Be aware that the prices online are a few dollars cheaper than the actual pricing at the restaurant! And the actual food is a little different (only a choice of toast not a scone, no cumin sour cream etc). We were fine with the options they had but docked a star because the online menu didn't reflect what was actually available."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"What a wonderful restaurant. It is a little hard to find, being almost at an overpass bridge instead of in the main restaurant area. But it is so worth the extra block or two walk (or just park nearby even). We were able to specify what hash we wanted, from base to meat to veggies to cheese, to how we wanted the egg on top, and they were fantastic. The service was also wonderful, as was the coffee. I cannot imagine being anywhere near this place again without going back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Amazing! Both the food and service were amazing. I'm Vegan and was able to customize their hash & it was delicious! The menu is a bit small, but it keeps the food good quality & coming out fast. It's not cheap, but the quality was worth it. Coffee was fantastic & they have a self serve water station with lovely glass bottles. Would recommend & come again."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great experience! I highly recommend it. Be prepared service is very slow but their outside seating is a great place to relax and sip your coffee while you wait. The build your own hash is excellent. I had the corn beef with hollandaise sauce. Everyone else was very happy with there combinations as well.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"As I search around my plate for more safe sausage from my build your own hash, I write this review. Fricken gooood"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,I was looking for something a little different and I found it here. The menu is short enough that you know everything has been perfected. They call themselves a hash house but the kids behind me seem to be in love with their pancakes. Clean and simple food hot and delicious. Locally made sausage and jam. No big buckets of butter and cheap Smuckers corn fructose jelly. This is the real deal. Probably all food here is locally sourced. Great service and plenty of elbow room. Super clean bathrooms.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"As a local, I usually go to Cajun Kitchen for breakfast outings. Yet, on a mission to use my axxess discount card we ventured to Dawn Patrol. I will definitely be back. I tried the chorizo hash which was super fresh and kept me full all they way until dinner! I highly recommend grabbing a spot to sit before ordering because this place is packed if on a weekend. 

Overall: 
Best part- Fresh Coffee
Worst part- The line"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Go here for breakfast! You can build your own hash of potatoes, veggies, protein, eggs, and sauce. Comes with toast made in-house and a little green salad. No gluten free bread and the veggie sausage has gluten. My salmon hash was really yummy. I will definitely return and highly recommend it."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Amazing little restaurant. Excellent service and food was quite delicious. Only complaint would be the pricing but I can't complain much as we are in Santa Barbara. Definitely recommend getting there salmon.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place is my new favorite breakfast spot in town.  I built my own hash and it was bomb! The food took a while, but worth the wait!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Build a hash was very yummy. Bacon I am guessing was good because my kids destroyed it before I got a chance to try. French toast was a hit. Dirty chai and Madagascar vanilla bean latte was very good, the latter is super sweet which I love, but not for everyone. Outside seating was nice!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Pretty good place I really loved the eggs and the potatoes I feel like it's almost kind of hidden but the staff are very nice and the food is good so over all a really nice experience
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I hope the owners of Dawn Patrol read this review because I really want them to succeed. 

I host a monthly coffee meetup and me and 19 of my friends went their this morning. We like their ordering structure: you order/pay at the counter, then they deliver your food to the table. Works well for our group. However, I've been disappointed recently in the quality of their food as it has not been consistent. I understand that restaurants are still trying to find their footing in a post-covid world, so hopefully this review will give them some constructive feedback.

Let's start with the good stuff first: I ordered the huevos rancheros and they were delicious. Fresh, lots of flavor. Appropriate portion. I also had a decaf Americano. Really good coffee. Their staff are very friendly and seem to be genuinely dedicated to providing a good restaurant experience. Good overall atmosphere and clean. 

Ok, now for the places they can improve upon...

I ordered a blueberry scone, and I was given a chocolate chip scone. Maybe the person at the register misheard me, but I hate chocolate chip scones. I also had a bite of some coffee cake and it was dry, like it had been overbaked. I had to track down the wait staff to ask for my decaf coffee on three separate occasions; finally after 30 minutes (after I had finished my meal), the coffee arrived. They also need to figure out how to identify the customer who ordered a meal; even though we're given a ""cartoon animal"" stand to identify our meal, the servers are always asking us ""Did you order this?"" Something isn't working on that front.

Also please, please, please, get another register! The line is way too long in morning. Takes forever to get through. Some friends arrived a little late and because the line is so long, by they time they ordered their meal and got to our table, we had finished our meal. 

We'll see you next month!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"It was ""Constant Companion's"" birthday, and I woke up before him. We had planned on going to breakfast, but I had a feeling that he wouldn't want to wake up/get ready. So, after a quick Yelp of breakfast places in Santa Barbara, I called this place and put in a to go order. 

I ordered two build you own hashes. CC's had russet potatoes, over hard eggs, sausage, veggies, cheddar, and country gravy (made with bacon). Mine had russet potatoes, over easy eggs, veggies, cheddar, and Hollandaise sauce. The packaged each meal nicely in a take out box. They each came with toast and a salad.

If you are ordering your food to go, I strongly recommend that you get it without the salad because it was all just sort of jammed in the box. I ended up dumping the salad out so I had room to eat the hash. 

We both really enjoyed our meals. There's also a pay parking lot right across the street, which made it really easy to pick up. I was in and out before the minimum, so I didn't have to pay anything.

End note: Make sure you get some of their jam. So good!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"From the fresh squeezed OJ to the homemade sausages & jam this place was a great find. The huevos rancheros came with beautiful presentation and everything had great portions. The service was quick & thoughtful and we appreciated them not having a wait despite it being Sunday brunch! So many of their items are made in-house, it's wonderful and an unexpected treat."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,My go-to brunch spot every other weekend. It's a huge plus that it's at the beginning of State street since you're not around many noisy restaurants and the only people around you are the ones eating there. Definitely recommend the Chorizo Hash special. They have some of the best chorizo in all of SB. The Kale and quinoa salad is also a must if you enjoy a good salad. Great flavor and the produce is fresh and clean. Coen at the front taking orders is always very energetic and explains everything each dish has to offer. Kevin was a great server and always brought a refill of water when needed. Thank you Dawn Patrol! You guys are a staple whenever I'm downtown out and about.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I've been here a few times and decided to bring my mom for her first visit. I usually always get the hash but this time I tried the kale and quinoa salad (although it ended up being spinach and brown rice by the time I got it). It was very good although they were a little heavy handed with the dressing for my liking. My mom tried the hash with the sweet potatoes and veggie patty. We both really enjoyed the combination and she especially liked the toast and jam. 
Overall, I'd say that the food is tasty and consistent, a place I definitely think adds some flavor to SB's breakfast/brunch scene."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Really friendly server Coen was very welcoming and helpful. He kindly explained  all the vegan options they had which was really nice for me. The food was delicious and the ambiance also great. They seem to be following COVID protocols so it felt safe with the doors open for circulation. Highly recommended!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"If you're craving a hearty hash at a casual spot, Dawn Patrol's got you covered! I had some difficulty reading the small font on the menu above the cashier while waiting in line, but this wasn't too much of a problem because their menu is also available on their website. You order at the counter, get a placard with a fun emoji (instead of an order number), and choose where to sit, and the staff brings the dish out to you. Cashier and wait staff were welcoming and friendly. For brunch, I made my own hash with poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, sweet potatoes, peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, corn, diced tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, sage sausage, and sides of two slices of toast and salad. I really liked how filling and complete this hash was with protein from the eggs and sausage, various vegetables, and carbs from the sweet potatoes and bread. It'd be great after a long hike or workout. However, it was glistening with oil towards the bottom. 

Parking's trickier since Dawn Patrol's located downtown, but there is street parking and a parking lot across the street. Overall, I'd definitely come back!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Nothing but great things to say. They had delicious gluten free options. The waiters were awesome and go above and beyond. Pancakes were great and gluten free! Enjoy :)
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Just left Dawn patrol and we loved it, all the reviews saying it's hard to find and that the portions are small, you definitely have to experience it for yourself because we found it right away.  It is hidden but there is signs so we had no problem.  Now the portions are small but perfect because they were just right.  What we should be eating lol.  Not my top review is for the food because it had flavor for sure, props to the chef.  The major reason we'll be back was Julio!!! Very attentive, super sweet.. if you go in I say ask for him you won't regret it.  There is customer service and then there is Julio he went above and beyond to make sure we were ok and to explain the menu of what was good and what wasn't.  When we first walked in we almost walked out the guy before him started off not so nice (might be the owner who knows) then he ease up so we stayed.  He told us how the process worked since it was our first time, handed us a menu and walked away.  Then Julio came out and explained everything, we suddenly felt instantly comfortable the way he was.  We were excited to find out after he was also our waiter so YES.  Thank you Julio"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"We stopped by Dawn Patrol when driving back home to San Diego from Solvang this President's Day weekend. We were excited to check the out the build your own hash that everyone mentions in the reviews. The food, their coffee, the freshly pressed OJ, and the service were really good, but the LOOOONG wait really made the entire experience bad. We had to wait in line for for 20 minutes just to order, then it was 60 more minutes for the food to come. 

When the food came, it was very fresh, well seasoned, and flavorful, but we were just so hangry and annoyed that it took so long to arrive at our table that we weren't able to enjoy it. I think the Dawn Patrol could be a 5 star breakfast spot if they could figure out how to cook eggs in 15 minutes like most restaurants do."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Everything was delicious  Go with the hash! The vanilla latte was good too, super strong but tasty"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great staff. Delicious food. Great location.
This place is amazing, we always keep coming back for more!!
My favorite is the build your own hash, it's nice to be able to customize and it even gives you a choice of veggie sausage!! You can choose the veggies to put on it, either sweet potatoes or russet potatoes, and then your choice sauce! I always get the eggs on the side since I don't eat egg and it's always easy ordering here.
We tried the Luau French Toast and it's very yummy, the Hawaiian bread gives it great taste. 
Very dog friendly so highly recommend this spot because of that, I feel sometimes for breakfast it could be hit or miss with some spots saying they are pet friendly then turn you away either because they can or because it's crowded and don't want the hassle of having dogs on the patio. This place is not like that at all, they do get crowded busy but are always super friendly with dogs and the food is so delicious we will always wait for this spot. 
Don't really understand the comments about it being hard to find a parking spot here, right across the street there is a huge public parking lot which is free for the first 75 minutes and $1.50 every hour after that. With that parking structure there why worry about looking for street parking? Make your life easier, get those steps in and walk across the street!!  This place is so amazing if you turn away simply because you can't walk across the street your missing out on a lot!!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I got the breakfast burrito it was OK. My husband got the hash and he liked it. Tap water was hard to drink. The home made bread was amazing.

Pricing doesn't match quality of food or environment. I am fine paying more for food if the food is higher quality tasting and/or the place is dialed in with decorations and cleanliness. Neither of which we experienced.

If everything was on the same level as the homemade bread I would have had a better experience. I left feeling disappointed."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"A delicious way to start the day, with a very friendly and helpful staff.

Our server Julio could not have been nicer. He got us off to good start with his food recommendations, and kept our coffee mugs full and hot.

We usually dive in to the tasty hash dishes, but today seemed like a good morning for their Fish Tacos, and Huevos Rancheros. Highly recommend both. 

Also a great way to start the day, with a public parking lot right across State Street on Gutierrez, and in between the Funk Zone and all that fun shopping on lower State Street."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Our group grabbed some food here before going to the train station (about a 5 minute walk).
They had both indoor and outdoor seating. They had a wide variety of food as well. 
I got the build a hash plate where you can customized what you get. It was good but I could have done without the salad for a breakfast people. 
The others in my group got the burritos which were large and very filling.  
Reason for 4 stars is because this restaurant was priced high for what you get. My build a hash and coffee was around $25."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This restaurant deserves 6 stars! We ordered the Eggs Benny, Chorizo Hash, and French Toast handmade in house and EVERYTHING was delicious!! Truly, one of the best breakfasts we have had since we moved away from New Zealand. Each meal was a top 10 delight. I wish I took photos as the presentation was beautiful (but we scarfed it all down too fast). Cappuccino was made to perfection and since we had a late Brekkie, they brewed a fresh pot of coffee for us too. Dog friendly, this place is the pot for a scrumptious meal. We will be back next time we are in town for sure!!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Food was very MEH and Dawn Patrol was a lot pricier than it looks. I know it's the area but still. We were visiting so thought we'd try it due to the good reviews. Just meh.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We found this place on yelp and it was only a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  There are plenty of tables available and some indoor dining as well.  The staff was very friendly and nice.  It was out first time so they explained it was order first then choose a table. 

We ordered The Patrol breakfast and added the pancake.  The flavors were good but the eggs tasted a little off and looked pale.  We also ordered the Build Your Own Hash.  This came with so much food!  The bread is amazing and was probably my favorite part of the meal.  We were told that it is homemade bread! 

We ordered 2 drinks - iced coffee and hot vanilla bean latte.  The latte was delicious, flavorful and had a right amount of foam.  I was honestly surprised because most breakfast places do not get specialty drinks on par.  However, the iced coffee was disappointing.  Its the same price as cold brew coffee and it was very watered down.  Speaking of price, our meal was about $45 (without tip) which is a little steep in my opinion."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"The food here was good.  Little crowded and very very slow when we went.  The staff was friendly though, we'd totally go here again for a breakfast bite."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"My cousin and I were visiting the area and stopped by this quaint brunch place on our last day in the city. There was a slight wait to order, but once we did the service was quick and wait to get our food was short. Both dishes we ordered were delicious. Everything tasted fresh and the outdoor seating was so pleasant on a sunny day. The restaurant is also just down the street for the pier and beach, so I definitely recommend taking a stroll down the boardwalk after you finish at this yummy spot."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"First visit, Service was very quick. All servers are actively working to clear tables and Service.  Everyone in the party tried something different and all were extremely happy. Avocado toast, chorizo hash, strawberry waffle with Sausage and fluffy power sugared pancakes. We will definitely be back!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Long line but it moves.  We had the chorizo hash special and it's was delicious!  We also had the French toast and it was just ok
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Fake maple syrup that leaves a persistent funky aftertaste...seems like syrup should be real for the price ($51 for breakfast for three w/ tip)

The single-use plastic straws in every glass of tap water were especially dissonant and off-message given the ocean theme.

Breakfast burrito was good and the gluten free pancakes were fluffy and tasty ... bring your own syrup from home, though."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Had the ""Build a Hash"" which was Amazing. You choose your own ingredients. I chose sweet potatoes, spinach, tomatoes, vegan sausage.  Topped with eggs over medium and Hollandaise sauce. Delicious home baked bread with homemade jam on the side and a lovely salad. You can't go wrong eating here. And great coffee!  A bit pricey but worth it."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The hash that i ordered was amazing and flavorful and the most wonderful! That fire roasted salsa was so delicious. I wish i could bottle that up and add it to every breakfast. 
Fave breakfast spot in Santa Barbara!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great spot for a quick breakfast. Build your own hash or choosing from the items on the menu.  

Had the egg white frittata and it was great.  Nice size and the avocado seeded was an interesting mix of taste and texture.  It worked.  

I recommend this place!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We came in this Sunday morning and it was insanely crowded on state street because the finish line of a marathon was directly in front of the restaurant. It was a bad start because the line was out the door. It took a bit to get to the register to order. After we ordered I had to go to the bathroom but the place was a mess because of all the foot traffic due to the marathon. So I sat donn and waited for my food a little grumpy. The staff was very friendly despite being slammed with a crowd. The food came out pretty quickly and piping hot. I ordered a veganized build your own hash which was very tasty. I sat down in a bad mood but they had me impressed by the end of the meal.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Watched the worker wipe down  all the water glasses with a bleach rag.  Water tasted like bleach.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"The ""Create your own hash"" was absolutely delish! We got russet potatoes, bacon, corn beef, cheddar, tomato, avocado, scrambled eggs and hollandaise sauce. It came with toast and salad! 

The service was great. All the employees were very friendly and checked in on us multiple times. 

The one thing was that is was little pricy if you are on a budget, but it feels like quality ingredients!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"got the hawaiian french toast which was pretty tasty! i liked that you can order up front and go seat yourself, pretty fast service"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Dawn Patrol is a cool place in downtown Santa Barbara on State Street. The staff is so nice here...we arrived alittle before they opened and even though they weren't ready to open (nothing was set out like silverware, condiments, water...) they still put on a smile and welcomed us in! 

We created two hashes...both with sweet potato, chicken, side salad, wheat toast, and salsa. One of them had eggs over hard and the other had eggs over easy. Both dishes came out correct and looking fantastic! The chicken and sweet potatoes came mixed with tomatoes and onions and was really good! The bread is homemade and you can definitely tell...it has a lot of grains and seeds in it, it was delicious! If you're hungry and walking through Santa Barbara I suggest you stop into Dawn Patrol!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This was a lovely brunch place! We came for breakfast but they have lunch as well. They close at 2pm so make sure to get there in time! 

You order at the front and then they will bring the food/drinks to your table.

There is a parking lot right across from the restaurant you have to pay to park. We couldn't find another option for parking nearby. 

Staff were friendly, and there are cute decorations! Lots of people just stayed a while to eat and drink at a slow enjoyable pace.

The food was very good but quite a bit pricy for what you got. 

They have fresh orange juice and loose leaf tea. They also have homemade bread everyday. Yum! 

They have indoor and outdoor seating. For their seating they have booths and moveable tables. They have both chairs with and without arm rests.

Overall a good place, because of the price I would be less likely to return though."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Delicious!

Had breakfast here yesterday. 5 of us plus our pooch.

Popo had the ham and eggs with toast. Loved the Hawaiian bread toast! 

Wife had the egg white frittata she loved it! Thought the vegetables inside were perfectly cooked.

Son had the chorizo omelet and loved it! Nice spiciness flavor of the sausages.

Daughter had the calif burger and loved it! Thought this burger was delicious! Juicy patty, nice strips of tasty bacon covered with delicious avocado.

I had the build your own hash which was delicious. Potato's, Ham with corn, spinach and mushrooms topped with two over easy eggs. Delicious!

Wonderful place to go!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Yum! Dawn Patrol has been one of our favorites for breakfast since their doors opened. Love their Build a Hash and gluten free pancakes. Customer service is always friendly. Highly recommend DP!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,We enjoyed our breakfast here so much that we returned again while staying in Santa Barbara . Jam and toast was a wonderful surprise to the main breakfast we ordered. Service is great and feels homey. I think the place is family owned. Not sure though but either way hard working and kind staff. We loved our experience here. Their toasts is made in house and tasty.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"First off, this place is difficult to park near, as the small parking lot nearby doesn't have spots for Dawn Patrol rather the other small businesses in the same building. Make sure you park in the public parking across State street (which is free for 90 minutes) or you'll find yourself driving in circles with all the one-way streets in downtown SB. 

Furthermore, I was super disappointed in this place, and am kicking myself for not have ordered a build-your-own hash!! Instead, I opted for their egg white frittata which comes with a seeded avocado and ""fresh"" (not so fresh) berries and washed it down with the cold brew. It wasn't at all what I expected, as you would think something that has egg whites would be on the ""lighter"" side. In fact, the frittata was swimming in cheese and so buttery that I felt best to leave most of the frittata on the plate than to have that gut bomb sit in my stomach. I also didn't quite understand the flavors or the point of the seeded avocado? I think I'll take my avos unseeded in the future. 

I even didn't much care for the cold brew (bland and watery)...mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Did I mention this place is PRICEY?! We are talking $20 for my coffee and mostly inedible frittata. Yes, I get it, Santa Barbara but also, it's freaking eggs and potatoes. Don't think I'd return on my own dime."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Food was fantastic. Service could use some help. As the line grew longer and longer there was still just one person taking orders and answering menu questions. it would be helpful when the line is super long, to have someone check in with the people waiting to be sure they've seen the menu and can ask questions. It would also be helpful for the cashier to be more empowered to make common sense changes to orders -- he had to go back and ask the chef if he could offer a small side of potatoes. That probably contributed to the line getting longer and longer as the morning went on. Also be prepared to drop about $60 for breakfast and coffee for two people."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I came here on a Thursday morning for brunch around 10 AM and it's your typical average brunch spot. The menu is quite small and doesn't have many options- you can't customize much other.  They do not have avocado toast on the menu which is a huge disappointment. The young man taking our order was friendly and recommended to get toast and just pay extra for the avocado on top. 

My friend ordered a breakfast burrito. I took a bite and it was good, but just nothing out of this world for me. The one thing that stood out to me is the freshly squeezed orange juice. Oh, and apparently they are known for their hash. Not a budget friendly brunch spot either- we spent about $50, and I only got a piece of toast with some avocado on it, an orange juice and my friend ordered a breakfast burrito."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Perfect spot for brunch. The hash was delicious and there was great outdoor seating available.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"*** 3.5 stars ***

Super long wait in line (even though the line was not that long it moved at a snail's pace) and for food once seated (another 20 - 30 minutes - yikes). The food is probably four stars but not worth the price and the wait. Not a huge menu and nothing stands out as particularly unique (just your standard brunch fare). Probably would not come back."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Chorizo Hash is the WAY TO GO. It was delicious. Sadly the picture I saw on here made me think it was much bigger. Expensive food but Friendly staff. Most of the other food wasn't as great as I wanted it to be. Served with barely any honey butter- needs more. Also the syrup was the cheap gross kind that ruined it. 

Nice spot with a great patio on Lower State Street."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Dawn Patrol used to be a really good restaurant, but this was ""pre-covid."" I hear it got new owners, not sure. But I went there yesterday for the first time after the covid lockdown, and I was so disappointed. First of all, the wait staff is really good, very accommodating. But their food was flat across the board. My husband, my friend, and I ordered the waffles, three-egg white fritatta, and the chicken and potatoes. All FLAT. Very little flavor (and no none of us have had covid to deaden our taste buds). The coffee cake and the coffee were ""ok"" - nothing to write home about. I know it's been a tough time for restaurants, and I really want them to succeed because this used to be one of my favorites, but with the kind of food Dawn Patrol is currently serving its customers, I'm not hopeful this one is going to make it. I tried to email the restaurant my feedback, but their website email link is down. So I thought I would put it on Yelp in case they read these reviews. Oh, and one more thing, get two registers, customers wait too long to place their order."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The hash was great! The ingredients are super fresh and you can really taste the freshness of every ingredient. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Highly recommend the Madagascar vanilla bean latte because it was DELICIOUS!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"What a cute place in Santa Barbara's downtown. First you are greeted by the nicest people. They made suggestions and were patient while we decided from the many yummy choices. We went with their special chorizo hash and the breakfast burrito. First, the coffee. It was so bold and flavorful. I am a coffee snob and this passed the test. The food is great. Like this place almost reached 5 stars. The hash was great with the chorizo bursting with flavor. The avocado was weird to me, but damn it worked so well. Everything worked. The wife reports her breakfast burrito was outstanding. She liked how the many distinct flavors  worked together. The stand out was the salsa. I could definitely drink that shit. So good. Go here, you won't be disappointed.  Come hungry, the portions are big and come early because the lines are big too. Totally worth the wait."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Great place for breakfast/brunch. Restaurant can be very busy on weekends with a wait, but service is efficient and turn over fairly fast. Menu is varied with lots of ways to make your own style breakfast. Ingredients are mostly locally sourced and always fresh. We love to sit outside on the front patio with great views of Santa Barbara. You are sitting along the State Street under past so there is some great people watching. Plenty of seating inside restaurant as well. If you like good wholesome, tasty food from great basic breakfast to waffles or pancakes then stop here. They also have great choices for children; family and dog friendly."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This place was fantastic! Great service, great food, and amazing salsa. The building your own hash was tasty and fresh!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I visited Dawn Patrol for my first time this past Sunday. I had the Patrol combo with buttermilk pancakes - it was delicious! However, the reason I am giving this restaurant 5 stars is because our server, Ryan, provided my group with the best customer service ever. He was helpful, kind, charming, and easy to talk to. If you're reading this, Ryan, I want to thank you again for being you! @iluwee

P.S. shout out to the worker who noticed my ""King"" mask and confirmed he is also a raver like myself. Pretty dope moment!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I had a wonderful Eggs Benedict this morning, perfectly prepared to my specifications--poached well. They are unusual in that they are served on a delicicious bread, rather than the standard muffin. I wasn't going to eat the potatoes and salad because I was so full, but I tasted them both, and they were both expertly prepared. I finished them both. The Hollandaise sauce  was so good, I asked for more, and it was delivered instantly. Service , overall was exemplary.  The coffee was excellent as well. 
They have expanded their outdoor deck so that outdoor dining is plentiful and pleasant, and I felt very comfortable dining here in these pandemic days. 
I recommend the place whole-heartedly, and intend to return here on future visits to Santa Barbara."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,Its overpriced. Also not consistent with the food it was good one time and not that good another time
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent breakfast!  The c
Beef chiliquiles is the only thing to order!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Interesting name for this Beechy looking breakfast spot.  Their specialty is making a custom order of hash with either sweet potatoes or russets and then adding your choice of protein veggies and topped with an egg if wished and finish with a choices of sauces. You also get a choice of toast or salad with the dish. 

Haven't had hash in a million years so thought I would give that one a shot.  Did the sweet potato as I've never seen that as an option.  Would have picked the veggie sausage  but it's made with eggs so they gave me avocado for no extra charge (normally $2).  Added all the veggies available which was tomatoes corn spinach and mushroom.  Got the two salsas they have on top one green and one red and chose the side salad.  

When I first got the dish I was impressed with the presentation.  Colorful with the orange potatoes and fresh looking veggies.  When I took that first bite I though wow those potatoes melted in your mouth.   Mixed in all the salsas and had a mini vegasam ..:)pretty dang tasty.  Love salad at any time of day so that was awesome too

Everyone in my party liked what they got which was the herbivore humus sandwich and the huevos rancheros. Everyone commented how fresh everything tasted.

My only reason for the 4 stars is they don't make the veggie sausage in house and it's not vegan and made by Morningstar and super processed.  Second if you omit many items like the egg or meats it's the same price.  It's still not bad at $13.50.  Overall I recommend people check this place out if you are looking for a hearty breakfast place with a fun vibe."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Decent little joint. Nice outdoor seating but pretty close to the noise from the highway. Great bacon! Very flavorful wedge potatoes. Good house made toast.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Service is second to none. They want to make sure you are completely satisfied. Food is great.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,First time to Dawn Patrol and had a wonderful breakfast. It sits on a busy part of state street but has plenty of seating in-doors and outside. I was able to create my own hash which was fantastic and we also ordered the grain free pancakes. It's a casual space where you order from the counter and wait at your table. The staff was very accommodating after a couple of hiccups but the flavors and choices where excellent. Personally it's only disadvantage is the noise level. They have construction next door and street noise that can be over powering at times.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Nice spot in Santa Barbara to have a quick brekky. I got 2 eggs and bacon and coffee. 


It wasn't bad! But it also wasn't amazing."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,The service was great and the food was delicious. I ordered their hash with sweet potatoes and also their sage sausage is fire!! My husband ordered their luau french toast and loved it.  We also had their orange juice which was fresh and delicious as well. Greatp place for food and outdoor seating. Thank you!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Yum. 

You can't go wrong with the make your own hash bowl with corn beef, poached eggs and sweet potatoes.. Or the three egg white frittata (sub sweet potatoes). I mean it's served with half an avocado rolled in seeds. Enough said.  Wait, I haven't said enough... They bake their own fresh breads daily. 

But really I'm an atmosphere junkie and this place does it for me. Dawn Patrol feels like Santa Barbara, they nailed 'locale' perfectly. 

Enormous coffee mugs, champagne and wine available, homemade breads and build your own hash? Yep, I'll be back.  

Star off because I was craving a fresh juice and it seemed funny to me that this place didn't have any. I also would have liked to see a made to order yogurt bowl. Perhaps a build your own yogurt and acai  bowl to accompany the build your own hash?  Now we're talking."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Cute place! Great breakfast, great service, and it was an overall relaxing stay. I got the combo and it was exactly what you would expect. My friend also got the chorizo breakfast and it looked amazing. So if you are looking for a solid breakfast place, definitely go to Dawn Patrol."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Just a heads up, you may be waiting in line for up to 30 minutes on some days so make sure you have plenty of time cause this place is poppin! My girlfriend told us about it so we went before the tacos and tequila festival. Got the build your own hash, best thing ever!!! Got the sweet potatoes, salmon, bacon, avocado, spinach and the herb aioli, the aioli was the only part I didn't like but luckily I asked for it on the side. The place it self is cool and colorful makes you feel like you're at the beach, lots of seating inside and out so that's great for right now that its so hot! Highly recommend and it's healthy so you won't feel bad for eating such delicious food!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Two stars because a simple breakfast shouldn't take 45 minutes to arrive! I had to check on our order since none of the staff came by our table. There was no apology of any kind when I did check. All I got was ""It's almost ready"".

My order was simple. Eggs, bacon, toast, and a few potatoes. My son ordered the three egg white frittata. 

The bacon was over cooked and my meal was luke warm. Nothing spectacular about it to take 45 minutes! Seems to be an ongoing issue here with the long wait. 

Rewind to my first visit ordering the salmon omelette which was amazing, and a nice surprise to find more salmon inside as well. Great taste and cooked perfectly. 

The chorizo hash was delicious and had great flavor unlike the traditional chorizo. Maybe it was spiced up with cumin? Not sure but it definitely worked. 

As far as service goes the cashier that helped me on both occasions was very friendly and greeted me with a smile. It's just a shame he couldn't give me the same service acknowledging the long wait for my order. 

Seems like hit and miss here because my first visit didn't take as long to get my food. My second visit left me very disappointed in the wait time and my food not satisfying me. 

Sorry to say I won't be coming back here!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We really enjoyed our breakfast at Dawn Patrol. I was in the mood for Huevos rancheros and they definitely hit the mark on this one. I ordered it with over easy eggs and the sauce and freshly made tortilla strips were delicious. We also ordered the special of the day which was chorizo hash and a vegetarian hash with sweet potatoes, spinach and tomatoes topped with over easy eggs. All were enjoyed and we would definitely recommend Dawn Patrol to those visiting the Santa Barbara area and locals alike."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"We came in early for breakfast today and had a perfect dining experience. We were all really hungry so go the ""Hash Plate"". Service was speedy and food perfectly balanced, hearty and healthy! Lots of options for vegetarians too! Savory, big plates, great bread!!!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,First time going to Santa Barbara and was starving Sunday morning! Wanted my eggs benedict and this place NAILED it with their flavor and even their portion! It was so good and the vegan sausage was a plus:) All the servers were nice and very attentive. Always came back to our table to make sure we didn't need anything else and our cup of  water kept getting refilled. I'd love to come back and would recommend it to everyone
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"I love a good, fresh OJ and homemade bread! This place offers both! I built my own hash with the sage sausage, spinach, tomatoes, onion & cheese with salsa. The homemade bread with jam really sealed the deal"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I was stoked to try this place out based on the reviews.
I know we're spoiled living in SLO, but I expected more from this breakfast spot.

Walk in and grab your own table, do it quick as seating inside is limited.
Head to the counter to order, grab a cool cartoon order card and sit down, your food will be brought out.

I love the idea of building your own hash!
I got mine with russet potatoes, poached eggs, (I paid the extra $2 for avocado), country gravy, etc.  I did it all up, tons of options.
So why did it taste so bland, and why the heck did I get an 1/8th of a slice of an avocado?!  I shop at the store, I know what an avocado costs, these guys are making bank on avocado add-ons if everyone gets the portion I got, holy geez.  Common Dawn Patrol, for a surfing themed resturant you're not nearly as chill as I thought.  Greedy much?

My wife had an egg white frittata that was okay.

The self-serve water station is neat but the water tastes terrible.  Seriously and I'll drink just about anything.  This was gross, bad flavor.

So yea wanted to like it more, but the bland food, cheap add-on quantity,  and the bad water just made me wish I had not spent $37 on breakfast here."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Excellent experience. Casual dining, high quality food with excellent service. I had the beef chilaquiles special. It was one of the best chilaquiles dishes I've ever had. I also enjoyed the gluten free pancake. My wife had the avocado toast which she loved and my daughter had the French toast (ate all of it). And the coffee is excellent!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Delicious!!  Homemade breads fresh daily. The tomotillo sauce is just amazing.  Fresh green salad and oven potatoes.   Just delicious for breakfast.  Friendly guys. SB has a new best breakfast restaurant!!!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"One of our new favorite brunch spots. We were absolutely blown away by this place. We got the build your own hash, and it was a great amount of food. But the all star...the house made jelly to go with the toast. I almost cried with how amazing it was."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,I don't really understand the hype about this place. I ordered the breakfast burrito. That by itself was $11. We came early so we were some of the only people in the restaurant and somehow it still took 20 minutes to receive our food. My burrito was what looked like a can of beans dumped onto a tortilla with a little cheese and some avocado slices thrown in. Somehow I just can't understand how a tortilla and black beans can cost $11. If there was egg in there it was so little it was impossible to find. We will not be returning here.
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Stopped here for our early, early breakfast to kick off our road trip.  The reviews were through the roof.  Cool place!  Great service and the food was not bad you can tell the ingredients were high quality and the menu was very exciting.  Liked the coffee a lot.  Really neat beach/surf/skate decor.  Parking was a little weird but nothing we couldn't handle at 7am as barely anyone was around.  Give them a try they have something for anyone."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Overall it was okay, but I wouldn't wait in line here. Portions are small, over priced. I waited as long as the people that showed up 15 min after me and no one checked on me after the fact."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,Great spot for a breakfast burrito!  I enjoyed sitting on the patio in the morning with the wife and baby.  Chill spot with a beach atmosphere
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"Overall, a nice place in the middle of a shopping center environment. 2 kids meals - a burger sandwich (bread has seeds that prevented normal picky kid 1 from eating it); a grilled cheese sandwich that I ended up cutting the ends off & kid 2 ate it all. A small French toast that picky kid 3 ate all of -- the fruit that came was separated on the table cause it was too close to the food. Kid 3 then wanted a side of eggs so we ordered that after we all were done. Parent 1 and Parent 2 ordered the chorizo eggs with cheddar cheese instead of Oaxaca cheese. The clerk had to check to see if that was an acceptable replacement or if I had to start a custom order -- she determined it was ok. That Taste was average or maybe a bit weird. The iced cold brew tasted more like iced coffee."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"I stopped by on a Sunday morning before it got busy and I I ordered the Spicy Chai and the BYOH, (Build Your Own Hash) which came with a green salad and toast. For almost $15, I hoped to get more hash - a little pricey for the amount of food (in my opinion). Both came out luke warm, like it had been sitting around for a while. I was afraid that my food would take forever to come out (based on other reviews), but it didn't seem to take too long. As I ate, I noticed how long the line was to order food. People dove for tables like hawks!"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,"the food is just ""ok"".

Spent 15$, which is way more than I'd spend at a dennys or iHop for a small french toast, bacon and milk with the tip. The french toast tasted like plasticy bread. 

Staff was really nice. Go elsewhere for the money."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"MY NEW FAVORITE BRUNCH SPOT IN SB COUNTY. 
Hands down, the BEST brunch/ breakfast place in all of SB county. I have been dying for this place to open back up since it closed because of the pandemic. It was worth the wait! So so delicious! 

My friend and I got the make your own hash (since that's what they're known for!) We couldn't decide on if we wanted regular potatoes or sweet potatoes, so we just got both and shared. I personally liked the regular potatoes more, but it's just because I cannot eat a large amount of sweet potatoes at once. However, if you love sweet potatoes, get it with sweet potatoes! It's so unique to see it as a hash option at breakfast places. The sweetness of the sweet potato with all the yummy savory veggies, runny egg yolk, and sauce is so DELICIOUS! Out of both sauces, the hollandaise was tasty, but I enjoyed the tang of the salsa more! 

We also got the Madagascar vanilla bean latte & the dark chocolate latte. Both were superb! Also, please don't forget to put jam on your toast, it is so good!! 

As for customer service, it was also amazing! They continuously checked up on us when needed and were super chatty/ helpful! We came on a Monday afternoon and it was packed, so I would be ready for the weekend if you choose to come. 

I will definitely be coming back to get another make your own hash & try to the french toast! 

Fun fact: they make their bread, chocolate sauce, and jam in house! 

Recommendation: 
- Madagascar vanilla bean latte
- Make your own hash: sweet potatoes, salsa, over easy egg, mushroom, spinach, pepper jack cheese and corn"
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"Delicious food.  Ordered the Luau French Toast and the Build Your Own Hash.  Loved that you can make your own hash and add as many veggies as you want.  Yum!  And - if you're into chai (the spicy version), their house made spicy chai latte is to die for.  So good!  The service was also spectacular.  Our server was so attentive and nice too.  Would definitely recommend and come back if I'm visiting Santa Barbara."
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,negative,The host made an incorrect order twice. Portions we're small and overpriced for quality. Ham on my eggs Benedict was served cold. Would not recommend. As a Santa Barbara local I am very disappointed!
MbzgGsMQpGyVrUJXi_Jw0Q,Dawn Patrol,American,positive,"This is why I love yelp. It led me here for breakfast and that made me super happy. 

Order at counter. Friendly casual spot with nice staff. Feels like the perfect local gem. 

Mimosas (duh), great coffee. Great beer selection. I had frittata at the suggestion of another Yelp review. It was delicious and didn't make me feel gross and full! The avocado was such a delicious addition, rolled in poppy, chia, sesame seeds. Why has no one thought of that before?!?!?! I added siracha because siracha. :-)

Friend got French toast, which he loved. Nice lemon touch. Only regret is not trying hash yet. So goals still to meet!!"

Our favorite thus far has been the Backyard Bowl, although there are several more that we still need to try. My husband and I are always full after we each get a kids size, or split a large. The ingredients are good quality,  filling foods. For the quality of ingredients, the price is very reasonable. It can get pretty busy here, but have patience, it is worth the wait."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Bomb. I go for the island bowl, always.  

""For your health!"" - Dr. Steve Bruhle"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I stumbled on this for breakfast. I had a Backyard Bowl - yummy. The large is pretty big. The granola in it was fabulous crunchy but not overly sweet. It's great to find a restaurant that serves up organic foods. Tomorrow I'm going to try the Island bowl.  Pricing is about $6-7 but worth it --- better than eating pancakes.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Amazing gluten free Acai bowl. I just got almonds instead of the granola. What an amazing concept for a restaurant. I highly recommend going here - very healthy, very fresh and you can tell they are proud of what they serve. Very unique and worth a trip.

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Best tasting and healthiest for the price point! Peanut butter Diego bowl has massive yummy energy
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"It's no secret that backyard bowls is a favorite in town, and with reason.  Their acai bowls are really good, everything is fresh and tasty!  All of the bowls I have tried are great and they can be very filling.  The large is A LOT.  Minus one star just because it's pretty pricey so it's not something I get on a regular basis."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Delicious fresh acai bowl that leaves you satisfied and content.  The acai is a combination of ice cream frozen yogurt texture topped off with granola and fruits. Yummy. A good healthy substitute for an ice cream craving.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"If you're looking for the perfect post-beach snack, this it!
I didn't realize how close it was to Lower State street and a little walk to the beach.

To switch things up, I ordered the Dragon Bowl which had pitaya, mangoes, kiwis, and bananas. The texture of the acai was very different. It had a glue-like texture rather than the classic icy-smoothie style. Besides the texture throwing me off, this was great! The sliced fruit was fresh and the acai wasn't so cold that it gives me a brain freeze! What really surprised me was how big the portion was. If you're not that hungry, I would recommend splitting this with someone or getting the kiddie bowl. 

The acai bowls are a little more on the pricier side~ $9 but it is a filling meal. 

There's free parking for the first 75 minutes in the lot across the way."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,My bowl was so delicious. It was so filling even with it being the small bowl. All of the fruit was fresh and it was music to my mouth
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I was in Santa Barbara last weekend visiting my friends who live there and I came across Backyard Bowls on Yelp. This place did not disappoint. You can it is a happening spot, hence all of the reviews and consistent business. 

I give this place 5 stars because the service was quick and friendly. Also, it is definitely one of the best Pitaya (dragonfruit) Bowls I have ever had. They give generous portions and the taste is just impeccable! It includes strawberries, blueberries, bananas, a little sprinkled coconut, and granola! My friend ordered the Berry Bowl and she loved it as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes a healthy & delicious boost to start your day! 

Next time I am in SB, I am definitely coming back. Thank you, Backyard Bowls!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I cannot express how much I LOVE this place! I haven't tried anything I haven't loved, and I have tried almost the whole menu. The Service is friendly, parking is readily available, the environment is welcoming and the fruit is always fresh. My only complaint is that they don't have a location in San Diego!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"im a frequent backyard bowls customer and usually disregard if they make one mistake but this time was different. it started off by them not answering the phone when i called so i resulted in making an online order. i made my usual modifications, nothing major, no banana sub strawberries, no honey sub agave. plain and simple. i was greeted by a guy who fumbled in the fridge to find my order until he realized it was barely getting made. one of the employees was glaring at me and when it was his turn to put the toppings on he sloppily cut strawberries- stems still attached and not even sliced (no big deal im not that picky). he yelled my name for the order even though i was standing two feet away and he knew it was mine? i asked for agave, he rolled his eyes, and barely put any on top. I get back to my car and realize that he forgot the blueberries, kiwi, and 80% of the agave. called back to let them know the customer service was horrible and that my toppings were forgotten and was simply told ""uhhhhh okay"". i immediately hung up after i heard no apology whatsoever."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love love love this place!  I make a point of it to come here every single time I'm in Santa Barbara.  Every time!

I never order smoothies anywhere else as I have a badass blender at home and can make just about any type of smoothie I can dream up (and I do).  But I will go out of my way to pick one up from this place.  I don't know what it is but BB has cast some sort of spell on me.  

Ugh, now I'm craving one..."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,freaking love this place! the acai bowls are amazing
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Good, healthy food. Efficient staff. 

I can't finish the ""small"" size. This location won't do a child sized Yogurt Bowl, but the one on upper State will."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"A quick place for some healthy snacks or breakfast. Service is nice, and the bowls are properly good. The Island Bowl was the first bowl I tried and it did not disappoint. The fruit was fresh, the smoothie well made and flavourful, and was pretty big for a medium size albeit it is a bit expensive.

To sum a bowl up, it would be putting Jamba Juice together with fresh fruit and other various ingredients. Definitely worth a try."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Huge servings of fresh fruit and organic healthy extras. Super yummy, great place for breakfast, with friendly wait staff."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Our first stop in Santa Barbara and I'm so glad we chose this spot for lunch. Delicious and filling! Definitely substitute the local granola for the granola the bowls come with
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Friendly service, priced a bit high, but average for mall location. The cashier recommended a berry bowl, so I ordered a large. It was an admittedly large portion of acai and fruit. 

Tasty, will come back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The most amazing place for a guilt free breakfast. Delicious smoothies and acai bowls all made with fresh ingredients. There is usually a line but it is definitely worth the wait!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I absolutely love acai bowls so I had to stop in when visiting from Seattle.

On a Sunday around 11, all the seats were taken and there was a small line. I only had to wait 5 to 10 minutes to receive my bowl, which I think is reasonable. 

I ordered the Backyard Bowl (which only comes in the large size for some reason... why?). This acai bowl includes a base made of acai, banana, strawberries, and hemp milk. The bowl is topped with sliced banana, chopped strawberries, blueberries, goji berries, bee pollen and granola, plus a honey drizzle if you want. It's already sweet enough so the honey isn't necessary. I added peanut butter to mine for a protein kick and more flavor. I enjoyed the bowl itself, although it takes some work to get down to the actual acai base in the to-go cup. I would have liked a few more berries too. The granola itself is kind of meh... not bad but not great. For the price ($13 to $14 after tax and tip) I think the bowl should have been a little better. Again, don't get me wrong, it was good overall. If you're hungry and can put away a decent amount of food, you should be able to finish the large. Next time I would omit the goji berries because I'm not a huge fan of the flavor but wanted to give them another shot.

Everyone working there was pleasant, but service wasn't spectacular. I don't care too much about that as long as I don't have to wait forever for my food to be ready. The place itself could have been a little cleaner... it wasn't super messy but there were strawberry butts scattered on the floor near the chopping station and the fruity smell in the air seemed a little stale. (That's just me being super picky and an OCD clean-freak... it's probably totally acceptable based on normal people standards).

Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again in the future. I might try the pb&j quinoa bowl because that sounds amazing! Nothing beats the acai bowls in Kirkland, WA though."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is a light yet very filling alternative to surrounding locations. And they're accommodating to a paleo diet all you have to do is bring in your own additions or replacements - like almond/cashew butter. 

The prep area is wide open so you can watch while they make your bowl. They use very fresh ingredients that are cut up at order or minutes before.

Tip: This isn't something I'd recommend you order on the go unless you eat it right away. It'll lose some of it's nutritional value if you don't eat once received."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"These are the best acai bowls maybe on earth. Where does acai come from? Maybe it's better there, but you probably can't get them as beautiful. And you can get anything off this menu (even the spinach one!) and it is reliably fantastic. No stray seeds (a smooth blend), no weird chalky flavor (tempered properly with honey), and fresh fruit. I wish they didn't close early but I get it.

Plus they do stamp cards!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Amazing açaí bowls and breakfast bowls BUT takes forever to get your bowl. If you're in a rush do not come here. I even ordered online at 11:05 am and it said it would be ready at 11:21 and I waited till 11:35. Whoever runs this places needs to find a way to be a little more efficient. I would come here more often if I didn't have to wait 30 minutes for a smoothie.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Stumbled upon this unique ( to me) lunch spot.  Loved the quinoa breakfast bowl piled high with strawberries and blueberries. We sat where we could watch the staff assemble the bowls.  Great for vegans, vegetarians and anyone wanting a quick nutritious bite to eat."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Very delicious!!!  We got the Berry Bowl and the Island Bowl.  The smalls are huge!!!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard Bowls has fresh, local ingredients and tasty smoothies. This is one of my favorite places in town for a light lunch."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Wow. Service here sucks.  Big fan of Backyard Bowls but walked in this morning at 7:04 to glares from 2 staffers as if they were upset to see customers so early, so I asked the boy at the counter if they were open only to get an unenthusiastic, unsmiling nod. Made us feel very uncomfortable being here. We look forward to BB during our trips to Santa Barbara, but I guess we'll try another location."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Super fresh and made right in front of you and delicious. If you don't mind the relatively high prices then go for it. Every bite was very good and of course the weather and open air seating is great too especially in Santa Barbara.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard Bowls was introduced to me by a friend. It's like a really good rich smoothie in a bowl. My only complaint is the price around $6-9.

Other than that I am a fan! I usually get the berry bowl (I don't like carrots and what not in my bowls) and it's the bomb. Coming here for Saturday / Sunday morning late breakfast early lunch is perfect. Heck, ANYTIME is a perfect time. 

The people there are really cool and even the small size is a fair portion. Sitting is a little scarce depending on what time you go.

Go with your girlfriend, boyfriend, friend, girl-girl date, brodate. Perfect spot for any and all of the above!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Try Mama's Oatmeal bowl...tastes like banana nut bread. You do not need to add sugar for the Mama's Oatmeal. Per the Acai Oatmeal...tastes like the berry. It has a strong herbal flavor but that is the taste of the Acai. It was quick and healthy, we would come back again. Perfect if they had their bathrooms. I had to go next door...it was unisex."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I could eat here everyday!  So good. Everything is so fresh and the people there are super friendly!!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"OKAY - LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE.  Not just for breakfast either.  It is healthy and while the downtown location is sometimes difficult to park by, the La Cumbre location is WICKEDLY easy and fast.

The bowls are delicious - I always get the island bowl and coffee with cashew milk - delicious.

The employees are great.  Brought in my best guy and he adored it - even over his choice room service at the 4 seasons!  Yum!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"At 9:30am on a Saturday, when the rest of downtown Santa Barbara is pretty quiet, this spot is packed - and for good reason!

The line to order wasn't long, just a few people. We waited a few minutes and were able to get a table - meant for 4, but we got enough chairs to squeeze 6 chairs around it. 

THE COST: $29 for three small bowls.

Note: The ""Small"" is still a decent sized bowl! We were afraid what the ""Large"" would have looked like. If you want what would be, say a ""Large"" at Pinkberry, then get the ""Kid's Size"". The ""Small"" did keep us full for several hours!

* Island - 4 stars
This is more heavy on the berry/tart flavors, and the toasted coconut on top is a treat!

* Cocoa Almond - 3.5 stars
Definitely sweeter, between the chocolate base and the banana. This would've been too much sweet on its own if I weren't sharing the Island with my friend!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Expensive but worth the occasional splurge. The backyard bowl is big enough to share if you aren't too hungry. I enjoyed every single ingredient:  acai, banana, strawberry, hemp milk, blueberries, goji berries, bee pollen, granola, and honey. I will definitely come back to try other items when I'm next in town."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Dan's Special is the greatest thing in the world. Everything else is pretty great as well.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Large servings with fresh, correctly-ripe fruit.  I will come back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"ACAI BOWL HEAVEN! I was recently in Santa Barbara for a stop during a road trip, and I decided to quench my endless desire for acai bowls at Backyard Bowls. As a die-hard acai bowl lover, I was so happy to find this awesome spot!

I ordered the Cocoa Almond Bowl (honestly tasted better than most chocolate ice cream), and my sister ordered the Green Bowl (kale, spinach, acai, ginger goodness--get this if you like ginger!). Both were absolutely amazing! Definitely a bit on the pricey side, but we ate them for lunch and one bowl was more than enough to fill up one person. I recommend coming here with a friend and splitting a bowl!

All in all, one of the best acai bowls I've ever had. Next time I'm in Santa Barbara, I will definitely stop by again at Backyard Bowls!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,a very interesting change of pace for breakfast.  delicious breakfast (served cold! be careful) that's perfect for vegan/vegetarian/fasting meals.   great flavors and very healthy.  A child's size bowl would be enough for me but I ordered the small which was more than sufficient.  can't imagine how much more the large bowl would be.  very hip location and crowd
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"You will never find acai bowl like this, I've tried many different kinds to try and fill my void of not being able to have backyard bowl and only getting one when I visit Santa Barbara and nothing compare or comes even close to theirs! They do it the best and the staff is always so friendly!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I attended here with my wife. She got the Diego bowl and I got the Berry Bowl. It is a nice little place. The bowls tasted amazing. My only complaint is that the small bowls that we got were still very large! Other than that, I would definitely come here again."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The young man with the very large eyebrows, almost like caterpillars, he was very kind. He helped me pick what i wanted, choosing between the island bowl and the cocoa almond bowl. I chose the cocoa almond. Although it was very loud and i could barely hear in there the food was totally worth it. It was really hot and i was uncomfortable sitting inside and had to take my bowl to-go.  Overall my experience was great and would definitely recommend my out of town friends to visit!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I love the menu,but im a local an i been here many times and there is never a good satisfying  good welcome or would u like to oreder!! Nothing not even a hi! Just a straight face!! Love love the items on the menu!!! But costumers service sucks !!!    
 Worst part!!! When i ask for a container to go! The cashier did not even bother to strive to make up for the straight face! Without a word she just pointed at the to go containers!!!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love this place! I love that there are 2 size options for bowls and smoothies. The green bowl and ginger smoothies are my go to, though I've loved everything I've tried. Would be awesome if they had recycling bins for the water cups, etc. (at least didn't notice any at the La Cumbre location). A bathroom would also be nice!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Best smoothies and yogurt bowls ever! Island bowl and berry bowl my favs, fresh ingredients great service.  Check it out!
Cheers"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I have never been to someplace like this before.  It as spectacular.  I love this type of breakfast!  I had the island bowl and fell in love instantly.  My husband had the yogurt bowl.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I make acai bowls at home all the time, so I was curious to try their acai ""green"" bowl just because it sounded interesting and different.  The first bite was a little bit odd but as I kept eating it it got better and better, and by the time I finished the bowl, I was happy and satisfied.

If you've never had acai before I'd say go with the ""standard"" acai berry bowl, but the other variations of acai bowls are worth trying.  I usually make mine with soy milk because I like the taste and slight creaminess it adds better than the apple juice they use at this place.  I didn't ask this time but I think they would be willing to substitute if you wanted."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Amazed to find a breakfast place that has vegan & gluten-free options. Hard to find that in most places, except for the standard oatmeal (not usually GF), grits (avoid those for GMOs plus the way it's processed, or the less frequent tofu which isn't always GMO-free. But I was really enjoying my hot quinoa bowl loaded with raisins, fresh RIPE strawberries & blueberries (not the standard tasteless kind). Would have liked to try an acai bowl but morning was still cool so the hot quinoa was the choice & I loved it. Filled me up enough that I didn't try a smoothie either. 

Service is super friendly. Like the bulletin board with all the local announcements, yoga studios, etc. This will be a go to spot whenever I visit Santa Barbara. So glad I found it since yelp didn't list it under vegan but hopefully this review will change that so other visitors can find this gem."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love their Island Bowl so much! Had a chance to enjoy a bowl while on a weekend getaway & since I've been back home, I can't stop thinking about it. Lol will definitely visit again when I'm in town or in LA (because I've already looked up all the locations lol)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The service at this location is TERRIBLE. Twice in the last month, I have gone there for lunch and it took 25 minutes from the time I paid for my bowl until the time they called my name. Absolutely ridiculous. The other locations aren't like this. I really don't understand. They have such a good product but this location needs some serious help with their service."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is exactly as advertised: unique, healthy and delicious! 

I had the backyard bowl and this thing was epic! You get your week's worth of antioxidants in one mouthful!

It seems a little pricey on first look, but when you take into acct the ingredients and the amount you get (you can make two meals out of the large), the price is on par!

Parking is a bit of a pain, but this place is well worth the effort. 

I just wish they had a BYB in Austin!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Yum. I've tried about 3 different things from this place now over the last few months. I'll be back. Green bowl is delicious and has great balance.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Atmosphere: Interesting crowd. Very young and trendy. Likely very privaledged people and that are local or college students. Not diverse at all. Most seem to be beach style (trendy but rough like you just got out of bed but your look is premeditated). Comfortable seating area, very busy which is probably great for business. Pretty sure I saw a dude with beach clothes on and a gold chain. Also saw some women in emo style but they appeared to be privaledged as well (obviously not certain of any of this but I want to paint you an accurate picture). 

Food: Pretty good and likely considered healthy (I can never really tell). Lots of Acai and other styles of bowls to include oatmeal and quinoa. I got the quinoa bowl and my wife tried the muesli bowl. The food was pretty good. 

Service: Nothing special. Good service. 

Overall: Probably worth going back based on the healthy option route. Not bad."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Mmmmm, simply delicious! I always want to try something new (a different bowl, a smoothie, or a breakfast bowl) but I can't seem to sacrifice ordering the delicious Island Bowl!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"On our drive from LA to our home in Norcal, we decided to stop at Backyard Bowls for breakfast. Neither of us thought bowls were very exciting, but they got excellent reviews on yelp so why not give them a shot.

We were totally impressed. The menus were clear and easy to read, and we both found exactly what we wanted right away. And YUMMO tasty, delicious,  healthy, lots o' berries, gluten-free, vegan option. ***Heart***"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Best pitaya bowl I have ever had hands down. Full of flavor and topped with the freshest fruit and the perfect amount of honey. Very reasonably priced and the place was very busy but we were served quickly! If you like pitaya bowls, it's the place to go!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Awesome spot, went for my first time today. I got the original Acai bowl (acai smoothie, granola bananas, and honey) and some Green Kombucha...so good. It reminded me of the food I get to eat in Hawaii. Gotta check this place out, it's great and I am already feeling more energized. I wasn't sure whether to add this as just food or in the health&Med category too."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great acai bowl.

I ha the Islander - the great thing about this place is if you get a large they let you split it in two so you can share it with someone without having to buy two bowls and pay more!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Bowls were delicious. Was a little skeptical at first since was just visiting the area and the location was a little funky but boy am I glad we stopped in. Perfect Acai to toppings ratio!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I have tried many versions of Acai bowls from tons of locations and BYB is my favorite. Perfect for if you are in a rush for lunch. Just call it in and feel amazing!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Santa Barbara Staple!! The berry bowl hits the spot but they have new and refreshing blends maybe every other week or so. (Pitaya bowl was a hit!!) Perfect for breakfast before hitting the trails or going on a hike! Everything is so fresh and CONSISTENT...which is important because some places give you an acai bowl that tastes different every time. Love it here! Very small space but that's what gives it character.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Incredibly friendly, fast, and delicious, and reasonably priced for really good ingredients. I got a PB&J quinoa bowl and it came out warm and loaded with banana slices on top. Perfect breakfast."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"This is a local favorite, according to this season's volume of a Santa Barbara food magazine I found lying around. Backyard Bowls is toward the end of State Street, in its own little corner between the chocolate and coffee shops. Ambiance here is super casual. Their little wooden tables and chairs fit so well in the beach scene. 

What's popular here is the acai bowl. Duh. They have a good variety on their menu. What I found different, or what makes them stand out, from other places that offer acai bowls is the hemp milk. I got to try some of it, and you have to really like the texture to be ok with having it blended into your breakfast. I want to say it is very earthy - almost like mixing protein powder in sweet skim milk, but it's not a homogenous mixture. I ended up ordering the backyard bowl and a pitaya smoothie. They do know how to spoil their customers when they upgrade to large sizes!  The acai bowl was ginormous.. I recommend sharing this slushie bowl with at least another person. The reason I say slushie is that the bowl totally came out that way. Maybe it was really hot inside (they didn't have AC and it was even cooler outside than inside).  I was almost sipping my acai from the spoon and eating the granola like it was cereal in milk. I did not like that. I love granola, but I didn't like the kind they serve here either.  The goji berries were dried and added a good hard/chewy factor in the bowl - they were harder to chew than raisins. I could tell the bananas were over ripe, and I had literally three blueberries.  The only good thing about the bowl was the fresh strawberries. I had such good expectations about this place, so I was pretty disappointed. 

I tasted the pitaya smoothie after I had some of the acai bowl. The smoothie was almost bland, but most likely because pitaya (or dragonfruit) is a pretty bland-tasting fruit, the smoothie was much colder, and the acai bowl was really sweet. The smoothie wasn't too bad so it kinda made up for my bad experience with the bowl. 

There are no restrooms at Backyard Bowls, but you can use the ones over by the coffee shop. You'll have to walk all the way to the back, past the baristas and kitchen to get to the unisex stalls on either side. I will think twice before coming here..maybe check out Blended in the Grass next time."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Young business.

Bowls are good.

Smoothies take too long to receive and are ok; I prefer Blenders in the Grass as they make better smoothies and are faster on delivery."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My first time having an Acai Bowl!!! And ever since then...I've been craving it!!!

What a great way to start your morning with a fresh bowl of Mother Nature's goodness. Us ladies were actually on our way to a hefty southern breakfast over at Cajun Kitchen but wanted to ""pre-game"" and have ourselves a healthy appetizer. 

I ordered the Berry Bowl (kids size) which comes with blended: acaí, banana, strawberries, & apple juice and toppings: banana, fresh berries, goji berries, granola & honey. BOMB dot diggity com!

Everything tasted fresh! Love that we can take bowls to-go. And also love their seating area inside this location.

I also noticed little kiddos enjoying some pretty massive bowls. Wowza.

You can see some live food porn of my bowl in my YouTube vlog here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Lz6k-tXhI&list=UU5YaBtOxOYqeFEEQ_aW6JiA"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My company and I came here after visiting Santa Barbara. This is one of the best acai and pitaya Bowl places that I have been too, ever. It's a little acai place by State Street but the line was out the door when we first arrived. Their menus are all written on chalkboards, and there are so many choices to choose from.

My company and I got the pitaya smoothies, the island pitaya Bowl, the berry bowl, and the green acai bowl with kale and ginger and lime. Let me tell you, we got Smalls and the portions were huge. I couldn't even finish mine. They say that honey is $0.50 extra, but they give everyone else honey if one person gets it.  The bowls range from around $8 to $11 and the smoothies were also about $8.  But for the price, the servings are large. 

The Taste, the freshness, the fruits strawberries, berries granola, even the acai we're all very delicious and worth the wait and the price.

This is definitely a spot that I recommend you guys to check out in Santa Barbara or if there any other backyard bowls locations. 

If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me. I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Went to B.B. two times during our visit to S.B.  So refreshing and delicious...both the bowls and the ""hot"" bowls are delicious.  Have you been splurging because SB has such great food?  Do it.  Go and detox a lil."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Fresh ingredients, clever combinations, and fast service. Recommend splitting a backyard bowl with some extra bee pollen and gojo berries."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love this place!  Great ingredients.  Super fresh, I always leave feeling satisfied but not heavy.  I do wish the downtown location offered more seating though.   If you're visiting on a weekend I might plan on taking my bowl elsewhere."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Perfect way to start your morning. Yummy! Great coffee shop (SB Roasting Co.) next door as well.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! About a year ago I visited SB and first discovered Backyard Bowls. During that trip I visited TWICE in 2 days because it was SO good. This past weekend I went back to SB and Backyard Bowls did not disappoint. The acai bowls are so filling and worth every penny in my mind. I wish there were more places like this in Davis. I've had the acai bowl from Jamba Juice and Backyard Bowls is WAAAAAAY better.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"We love coming here for our Acai bowls but today we got horrible service from the girl working calling out the bowls when they were done (young blonde girl with sloppy pony tail) she first called our name and gave us the wrong bowl but then called our name again with the right Island Bowl that we ordered. I then turned in the wrong bowl and she gave us the rudest attitude like it was our fault! I then said okay well here is the other bowl that we didn't touch at all, and she rolled her eyes and I still said thank you and she turned her back and ignored me. The customer next to me even looked at her in discuss with her nasty attitude!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Such a Santa Barbara place. Love it! Very healthy fruit blends with nondairy milks. Even though I think the place is best for those sweet tooths for breakfast, I have enjoyed getting a bowl for lunch as well."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Acai bowls are very tasty and options are plenty. Service is professional and friendly.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,My brief experience here while passing through on vacation made me want to move to the west coast. I was in love as soon as I walked in. Their menu is purely awesome and their operation very high functioning. The staff has a great vibe and wonderful attitude. I couldn't decide between the Green Bowl (I really needed some greens) and the Cocoa Almond Bowl (because I live for the cocoa-almond-banana combo) so I got one of each - best decision I ever made. Incredibly delicious and of high quality. I highly recommend and can't wait to return.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Unbelievably delicious. I even convinced my hubby to order a bowl and he agreed it was like eating a healthy dessert. He got the berry bowl and I got the island bowl. Both kid-sizes, and very filling. $6.95 each but soooOOOOoooo worth it in my honest opinion. Definitely say yes to the honey drizzle when you're picking up your bowl. YUM!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I'm a huge Blenders fan and decided to spice up my repertoire with this local alternative. Didn't encounter the long lines at 3:00pm, the Berry Bowl was quite tasty and really large portions even for the ""small"" bowl. It's just not for me. 

Pros: Fresh berries, innovative menu options, friendly customer service. For the ingredients and portions, I feel the price is reasonable. 

Cons: I don't like granolas with clusters, but this could be my own personal vendetta. Flavor got too repetitive after 5-6 bites. 

Despite the reasonable price, I probably wouldn't risk going back to order something again unless I had a friend to share it with. This is due to not enjoying my huge Berry Bowl (size small) and forced myself to finish it so it wouldn't go to waste."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Healthy and delicious!  A bit pricy though if you get addicted to it.  Luckily, or unluckily, I live too far away."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"For a quick, nutritious, and delicious breakfast you can't beat the Acaí Bowl.  With whole blueberries and the crunch of the granola...it's the whole package.  And SB Roasting Co is steps away!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Healthy, plentiful, overall great!

My girlfriend and I were visiting SB and we shopped around downtown SB during Black Friday. We were a little hungry but not for heavy food. Luckily, we were able to go to this local acai bowl spot and got just what we wanted.

We both got bowls and they were pretty well-sized. Absolutely taste, full of fruit, and there's actually a hefty selection of types of bowls to choose from.

There's different bowls for everyone so no matter who's in your party, there's something for everyone!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Had breakfast here with my mom (and dog) since they have open seating. Yummy and healthy options and the service was pretty quick. Cost about $17 for two yogurt bowls and I definitely want to go back to try the other options.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I've only had bowls like this at a few places, so maybe I'm not well versed. I got a Diego Bowl, girlfriend got a Berry Bowl. I don't like Berry Bowls as much, but usually love bowls with peanut butter in them. 

The Diego Bowl wasn't that great. It was a bit bland, the banana was a bit hard, and I could barely taste any peanut butter. However, the granola was really good, and the area/vibe is neat. Portion size was solid for a small too."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"So heavenly! I can't believe in all the years I lived in Santa Barbara this was my first time having Backyard Bowls. Definitely worth trying out! 

Order a kid's size if you can. The kid's size is still pretty big! The cost for a kid's size is roughly $7! $7 well spent! 

When they ask you if you'll like honey, say yes. It may sound weird to have honey with your smoothie bowl, but it's delicious."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Everything about this lovely, smoothie cafe tucked on the very end of State Street ticks all the boxes Santa Barbara has reputed for - ultimate perfection. Anything off the Backyard menu will leave you feeling full, vibrate and well worth the price. I would eat here everyday if I could!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Backyard Bowls: if only you did a few more things right, I'd really love you. 

Let me start by saying the concept and bowls are awesome. The fruit is always fresh and tasty -- if you get your order in a reasonable amount of time. 

The order pick-up process is frustrating. When your bowl is complete, it's placed on a counter with your ticket and one of the staff members will call your name out. However, there's no order on this table...staff members just throw the bowls on the table and the name caller just picks a random bowl up. I stared at my last order for nearly 15-minutes as my smoothie melted away and the fruit began to warm up. 

Which leads me to my next point: it's expensive. I get that they're making fresh fruit creations to order -- love it. However, it's not cheap, so make sure I get my bowl in tip-top condition. Having my order sit for 15-minutes and dragging my experience out 45-minutes makes your store inconvenient. Add the long lines and you may be there for awhile. 

3-stars: ""A-OK"""
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Quite nice yet a bit too sweet and too copious for breakfast. A refreshing treat but probably well around 1k calories per bowl
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I'm gonna make a bold statement. Backyard are my favorite variety of bowls. Whether it's a soft base of oats topped with the freshest of all berries and a drizzle of honey, or a thick hand crafted organic acai base topped with a vast landscape of culinary creativity my backyard bowl always exceeds my expectations. 

The place has a local vibe going on being next to the roco and with all of the local flyers hanging up on the walls tipping off locals and tourists alike with spectacular events. The smoothies are prepared well and it's hard to even taste the greens in any of the healthier smoothies. Other beverage such as the Yerba matte fridge make this place a go to spot for a healthy breakfast treat. The price can set you back but goji berries are fucking expensive so you're they aren't bending you over on markup.

If you want quality food, organic acai, or even just a smile on your face go to backyard bowls."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I had the backyard bowl and it tasted quite boring for the price. I probably wouldnt go to this place again.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Had the green bowl, super delicious. Granola is crunchy and the blended fruit is super cold. Generous serving of strawberries on top. Went back again same day and got the cacao smoothie + peanut butter. So good!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Decent and extremely popular with the local crowd, they serve several different smoothies and bowls with a variety of fruits and other healthy ingredients.

Why the 3 stars? The Acai. On my first visit I tried it and was hoping for the same flavor as I had recently had in Brazil - not quite.

On my return visit today I tried their PBJ bowl which, for breakfast was good. Lots of bananas, quinoa and both nutty and sweet flavors."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,An amazing option I hope to one day find on the East Coast. My friend and I were driving from LA to SF and wanted something filling but not heavy. We hit the jackpot at this place. Fair prices and yummy ingredients. Expand to Maryland! :)
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I first had acai at the Health Bar in Hawaii, and I hated it. It was just icy and very cold. Didn't offer very much to me. It was like eating medicine.

All my friends rave about Backyard Bowls; it's a must for any of their SB trips. I went here with low expectations, and they were surely lifted! The acai is creamy and paired well with crisp rice and granola. Portions are filling. I give it 4 stars though since I thought the prices were kind of high. I suppose anything in SB isn't cheap, though."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Full disclosure: I didn't actually eat here, but I'm still rating my experience.

Took a day trip to Santa Barbara and was looking for a nice treat to soothe the hot summer sun. Yelped Backyard Bowls to find a very highly-rated option. Excited, we parked and went in and walked right back out.

The options were complex, overpriced, and limited. It didn't look like I'd be able to get a simple vanilla frozen yogurt. Santa Barbara could benefit from a simple ice cream shop or a Yougurtland or something similar."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,I usually come to this place a lot and enjoy there smoothies and acai bowls all the time. Sometimes the wait can get pretty bad but nothing too crazy until today.  I ordered a Hercules smoothie which I get all the time and the wait is usually 5-15 mins. Today I waited 30 mins for a smoothie.  I go up and ask about my smoothie after waiting 30 mins and found out they haven't even started it.  After that I watch the guy behind the counter make my smoothie in less than a minute.  Honestly probably one of the worst smoothies I have ever bought and I dont think I will ever come back.  I could have made a better smoothie.  Just very disappointing.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Best acai in town   
Great smoothies
Super healthy 
Great staff
Great location 
Easy parking
Perfect pick me up"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is so good! The feel is kinda like an organic Jamba Juice but the menu is made of real ingredients made in house vs previously frozen fruits and yogurts.  Most of the menu consists of acaí bowls. They have a few hot bowls made w granola or quinoa and finally about 7 or 8 smoothie options. 
I had the berry bowl which was delicious. So refreshing! My husband had the P&J quinoa hot bowls which he loved so much he asked me to try and make at home:-)
They have a small seating area next door with maybe 6 tables, so finding a spot may be tough. I noticed a lot of people ordering to go which is what I would do next time. 

I wish SD had something like this! 
I'll definitely be back next time I'm in SB!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"We go here everyday when in SB. Lots of ingredients, awesome bowls. Fun atmosphere. A healthy way to start your day or get refreshed."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"After reading reviews of people who seemed thoroughly addicted to Backyard Bowls, it was time to try them out.

And by addicted, I mean, describing an exhilarating rush when consuming the bowls, and looking desperately forward to the next time they can have one, and noting that they can't live without the bowls now.  What is this, crackyard bowls?

First, everyone inside the place looks like a yoga/pilates/some kind of healthy lifestyle type or surfers if they are dudes. Ugg boots, yoga pants, tank tops, ball caps. Slather on a little extra estrogen, because the primary clientele appears to be women. So guys, take note: might be a good place to meet women. 

The options are bowls of acai yogurt base, or granola or oatmeal, or cups of smoothies. Everything's in the price range of about $6-7 for regular sizes, or $9 for large sizes.

I ran into a friend who'd just sat down with this large bowl of stuff. It had the acai yogurt, granola, strawberries and bananas, goji berries, lots of fennel pollen bee pollen type stuff and the whole thing was drizzled with honey. It was the large bowl and it was massive.

I got, I think, the berry bowl, which appears to be very similar to what my first friend had, minus the pollen bits. The friend I came there with got the island bowl, which looked like both of our bowls, but with shredded coconut on top.

I have no doubt that the offerings are rich in anti-oxidants and the food provided is very nutritious. But I do wonder if people are so overwhelmed by the idea of so much Good Stuff that they ignore the fact that most of these items are still 700+ calories.  Are they eating this with the idea that nearly half their daily calorie intake's been covered? This is definitely a better 700+ calories than, say, a burger, but will it sate people's hunger for the same amount of time, or are they eating the bowl and then going out for the burger?  Hmm!

Overall, I enjoyed the food, although it was a bit cool that morning and this definitely would have seemed more refreshing on a warmer day. I did feel cold after eating it. As a consumer of yogurt, fresh fruit, wheat germ and agave nectar, I felt I was already eating breakfasts like these, so perhaps it was not worth paying an additional $6 over eating it at home. But Backyard Bowls was terribly popular and crowded, so it's doing well, and this is a Santa Barbara originated company, which I wholly support. 
For those who can't put together a bowl of yogurt or oatmeal to save their lives, Backyard's here to help. You can find them at the corner of the parking lot. Tell your friends.

ps. For those who've never been and are confused as to why a place with such rave reviews has so few actual photos of the food, I hope the ones I've uploaded help."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Super healthy and everything on the menu is great. Sometimes a long line but it goes quick
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Acai bowls truly are the best food invention ever! Everywhere I go, I'm always on the lookout for the ""it"" acai bowl place in the area. This seems to be the place in Santa Barbara. I always opt for an acai bowl with peanut butter, so obviously that's the one I went with. The bowl was freshly prepared and their serving sizes are big! Definitely a neat spot...and there's coffee and yoga right next door!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"THIS PLACE IS WONDERFUL.

PARKING: Lot and some free street parking if you're lucky!

FOOD: I ordered the berry bowl (small). I can't wrap my head around the idea of finishing a LARGE bowl. This ""small"" bowl was packed with acai puree, fresh berries (which were incredibly fresh and ripe!), granola, and bananas. Who knew that goji berries could be sweet? Apparently they're great for red blood cell regeneration! 

SEATING: There's limited seating to the right of the establishment, but I saw people just sitting in the sidewalk and enjoying their to-go order. Seems like a great place for the neighborhood!

This is a great spot for a breakfast post-hike or a healthy start to a packed day. I'm craving one right now as I'm writing this!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Healthy Whole Foods are so fulfilling! The Backyard Bowl is my fav and you order the large and split it into 2 bowls for $1 more. I just have to get a bowl every time we drive through Santa Barbara. And my hubby doesn't usually go for healthy meals, but surprisingly did LOVE it! He finished before I did! Bee pollen helps with seasonal allergies and the fresh blueberries, strawberries, and bananas are so simple yet satisfying. Goji berries are so chewy and flavorful."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This place has changed our outings. There might be a wait but well worth it. The customer service is great and so are the açaí bowls. Do yourself a favor be patient and you should not be disappointed.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Came here after hiking Inspiration Point. I got the backyard bowl which is huge and delicious. I mean really really good. Only took of a star because the cashier seemed out of it and confused and the bowl took sorta forever to get to us. Bowl is very refreshing. Wish we had one of these where I live. 

It's next to the Vons in the shopping center off Plaza."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Pretty disappointing as far as the SoCal acai bowl scene is concerned. I got a small green bowl and it was less than 1/4 acai, a pathetic smattering of granola, and 3/4 strawberries. When I asked if that was intentional, they said all their bowls are like that so I kind of feel like I paid $8 for sliced strawberries. Not to mention the several spoonfuls of chunks of still frozen kale and spinach. Will not be back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This was my first acai bowl experience and although maybe an acai bowl neophyte, this has to be the tastiest, most refreshing bowl I've had. My husband and I returned every morning for more. The bowls include incredibly fresh ingredients, are a decent price, and the menu options are inventive."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Simply amazing! I got the Spartan bowl and couldn't have been happier
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Food: (5/5)
I got a classic acai bowl. This place LOADS IT UP with toppings. Usually when I get a bowl, i struggle with having too little toppings, but here? I have just the right amount to have toppings with every bite (And maybe more). 
Yeah. It's dank.

Service: (4/5) 
Decent.

Environment: (4/5)
Decent."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Best açai bowls in town! Fresh, tasty, and healthy! I'd come back every day if I'd live here."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Diego bowl was SO good! Huge portion, we said we would split one next time.

Often times bowls fall short on the toppings to acai ratio, but there was plenty to go around. Can say nothing negative, perfect start to the day!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"been lovin backyard bowls forever. yes it can be a little bit of a wait, but it's so worth it!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I am in LOVE with this place. When ever we are in in SB I always stop by to get a bowl. They are so fresh and taste amazing. My daughter absolutely loves them. Only two things I can complain about first the price for a bowl is a little high and I wish they posted or provided nutritional information for their food. Over all a great place to stop in and get a snack.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love Backyard Bowls!! Seriously, no acai or pitaya bowls can compare to here.  All of the ingredients are so incredibly fresh.  They have great extras that you can add to any smoothie, bowl, oatmeal, quinoa etc.  Backyard Bowls is 100% better than Brasil Arts Cafe and Blenders."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,We came back here a few times during our vacation.  The acai bowls are just so delicious and refreshing. We grab some on our way to the beach. It made the perfect breakfast on a hot sunny day.  He place does get quite busy in the morning.  It takes them a while to make each one so be prepared to wait.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I come into this backyard bowl and get my breakfast before work everyday, and for some reason the girls that work here have always given me attitude. I came in on saturday and ordered the same thing I always do not only did they give me the wrong bowl but the two girls that were working were just plain RUDE! I would think that they would take better care of there regular costumers."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great place, great customer service. They will always go out of there way to help- whether through recommendations or running your order to your car. Breakfast bowls are fantastic and very very filling."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Best acai bowls I've encountered (and I have had my fair share!) A bit on the pricey side but worth it. Try them..you won't be disappointed!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,The employees are novice millennials who offer mediocre service at best. The cashier had difficulty performing basic transactions and servers forgot to fill half of our order. The bowls are delicious but not worth the overall experience. I recommend Diego's Power Bowl.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"20 minutes for a small bowl of granola, yogurt and fruit is almost as ridiculous as paying over $8 for it. This place needs to figure out that if you are going to charge primo prices the customer service needs to get a lot better.  Until then, don't wast your time."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Excellent selection of acai bowls, smoothies, and breakfast bowls! The fruit is fresh and delicious!!

Well worth the money!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Call ahead. A 30min wait. Bummer. Too successful or poorly managed. Needs more people behind the counter or better process to handle the orders. Large serving sizes at least.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love this place. Eat here at least every other week. Consistantly fresh, refreshing, and delicious."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Everyyy timeee I go to SoCal I HAVEEE to hit up Backyard Bowls.

Heard about it from some foodie friends and it's basically the best acai bowl place evaaa. 

I always get the small Green Bowl, I love the ginger kick in smoothies and I think this bowl has a good amount to it. It's a little bit on the pricey side but it's a great guilt-free snack that makes you feel good once you finish it.

Heads up, they have no bathroom so you have to go to the coffee shop next door.

I give it 5 stars for the texture of the acai bowl, fresh fruit, bomb granola, and friendly service. Just watch out for the brain freeze, because you'll eat it thattt fast because it's that good!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Incredibly loud with all the drink making inside and people trying to talk over the machines. If it's not a nice day to sit outside, I don't go there."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This place is fantastic!  Even my 7 year old and hubby enjoyed it. We got the berry bowl as most suggested. Super fresh and tasty. Looking forward to findng something similar in OC.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Awesome acai bowls! Can't go wrong. Lots of seating, and reasonable prices. We went with the Berry Bowl and the Island Bowl. Both were excellent!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I live in LA and I am SO upset that there is no backyard bowls here. Although that is probably good for my wallet, because I would be here all the time if I lived closer! 

Backyard bowls is the best place I've eaten ACAI infused food. I shared a smoothie and a bowl with my friend and they were both delicious. 

I highly recommend this spot to Santa Barbara visitors and locals."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Wow, what a surprise!  This place completely rocks.  Was in SB for vacation, and stopped by to check out what all the fuss was about.  My husband and I both loved this place so much we are still craving it after coming home!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard bowls is excellent. Clean establishment, friendly staff, and delicious bowls make this place somewhere to return to. I usually get the classic acai bowl or the bowl with peanut butter and cacao. Always have the freshest fruit, especially the bananas!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Huge jamba juice fan and these guys/gals blow them out of the water. Kind of on the high scale price range, but you get what you pay for here. Awesome breakfast spot in the downtown area and of your not trying to have a heavy meal."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard bowls is a cool, modern place serving tasty food for the health conscious! I got to try the Deigo bowl.

The Diego bowl is absolutely amazing!! The slight peanut butter taste just elevates the bowl for me as I love nutty flavors. Also the toppings provide the right flavors and texture contrasts. Just a good bowl overall. 

I also liked the fact it is within walking distance of many attractions, like Stearns Wharf, the beach, and State street."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This is the only place that entices me to eat healthy! Great for breakfast and huge portions
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"this is one of my favorite placed to get acai bowls. This place has by far the best acai bowls I've ever had. I recently had the backyard bowl, which was nothing short of amazing. Keep in mind that the large bowls are very filling, so be ready to eat, or share. If I lived in Santa Barbara, I would probably eat here several times per week. If you haven't already, give this place a try - pretty tasty!!

I will definitely visit this place on my future trips to Santa Barbara!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,4 1/2  I visited SB this weekend and discovered this amazing place! I got acai berry bowl and added hemp seeds in size small. It's absolutely yummy! 1/2 star off for the prize. A little pricey but hey I was on vacation!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I loved this place!  I was in town just long enough to grab the Island Bowl on my way to catch the train. It was great!

I don't eat Gluten, so they suggested I add almonds to mine, and it was the best thing I've ever had!   I had Acai smoothies in Brazil, and this was just as good, but different if you now what I mean. 

The fruit and ingredients are really fresh and great, and highly worth the price.  And I definitely recommend the Island Bowl.  

It's sure to be a stop on my list every time I head home to SB."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,BEST ACAI BOWLS AND SMOOTHIES!!! Seriously obsessed with this place and used to come at least 4 times a week when I lived in SB.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Berry bowl all the way. Love how refreshing their acai bowls are! Each bowl is filled with healthy goodness, you will love it!

I got mine blended well with acai, bananas, strawberries, crunchy granola, and apple juice topped with honey, lime and blue berries. 

They are very generous with toppings and add-ons. Their bowls are super filling, I could barely kill mine (even though it was really good). I saw people getting mini size but I found that actually pretty big too. But no worries, the bowls are mostly fruits and carbs, you will find yourself hungry an hour later. 

I highly recommend giving this place a shot for anyone whos visiting sb & this needs to come to LA soon! I can eat this alllll dayyyy (:"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love backyard bowls! Hands down best acai bowls in Santa Barbara. If you go during peak hours it can be super busy and take a while for your order, however it is seriously worth the wait. 

Backyard Bowls is SUPER generous wth their sizings and portions. I've been to a lot of acai bowl places in San Diego and Backyard Bowls is better than most. Definitely worth the wait when it is busy, and the service is always friendly!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Probably one of the coolest out of the way places that I have ever gone to. I ended up getting the berry bowl, which tasted pretty darned amazing. The service was pretty quick too despite the fact that it was crowded (for obvious reasons). Overall, it is definitely a great place to check out if you are in the Santa Barbara area."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Oh My Goodness. This place is so freaking good. We both got the yogurt bowl and it is incredible (although I have to say I was expecting it to be a little colder in temperature so that was a bit weird). I also got the Pitaya smoothie which was amazing! Definitely eat here, you won't regret it."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Solid place for a quick healthy b-fast. Fresh and quick! The service was quick and helpful and they were flexible with their bowl ingredients. Nothjng about this place is a must have or unique.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Loved it.  Want to go back over and over and try everything.  I had the acai bowl and BF had the oatmeal.  Will definitely return when I got back to Santa Barbara.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"If this isn't already a famous franchise, it will be.  I never wanted the bowl to end. It definitely has aspects of Korean poppinsu (which you should absolutely try at cafe jack or koffea in Koreatown.)  but makes blended fruit its base.  It's like eating the most refreshing ice cream without the guilt!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Ate here 2/2 days while in SB. LOL. Guess I'm a fan.

Warning: This NOT a snack (or desert). I tried to treat it as such and left each time stuffed and unable to finish. This is a meal, dear friends. 

And for the uninitiated: This is NOT frozen yogurt--but more of a frozen smoothy, with cereal toppings. And it is good.

We had: Diego's Power Bowl (3/5), The Island Bowel (4/5), and The Green Bowl (5/5)."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Eco-friendly and delicious! Backyard bowls is absolutely mouthwatering! Try the berry bowl or the island bowl :) Definitely a local favorite.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"We need more backyard bowls!! I love this place, I would eat here every day if I could.  Large berry bowl to-go, Done.

P.s. maybe Montecito is the next location? Pleaseee :)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,been going to this place since it opened and have loved it ever since. now i'm in SF and miss it. come to SF! they have good smoothies and bowls. it feels like exactly what I should be eating. almost everyday.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I'm a bit of an acai bowl snob, had some great ones - these are right up there. 

Usually a bit if a line and wait but only because these are legit."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Was only in Santa Barbara for two days but had a great muesli breakfast bowl at Backyard Bowls.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is the best acai bowl you will ever have. I have had many in my life and this is by far #1. It's pricey because it's a pretty big quantity for an acai bowl, bigger than any other acai bowl I've had. But it's never big enough. I always want another when I finish one. My favorite bowl is the Diego bowl because it has peanut butter. The island bowl is also really good because it has coconut shavings. I've tried the smoothies which are delicious too but I would prefer the bowls. These items leave you feeling energized and refreshed. Very healthy!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious and healthy breakfast or mid-day snack! I have been coming to the Santa Barbara location before they opened up the West Hollywood Location. I love that they have ""kids sizes"" which is filling. Love the fresh fruit and granola they put on top. The line is a little long but good things come to those who wait! It's definitely worth the wait!!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Every time I'm in Santa Barbara or past through I have to stop and get a bowl. Which happens to be often. I have had acai bowls before but none that compare to Backyard Bowls. I always get the Island bowl and I am always pleased. Everything is just so fresh! Come to L.A. please!!!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Solid acai bowls with fresh fruit. Only problem is I found a long hair in my bowl! Workers need to be careful when making the bowls. Pretty grossed out when I found it.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I used to love this place, but it seems to have been ruined by its popularity. Good food, yes, though the prices are high. You might have a reasonably good experience at an off-hour. But in prime time, the lines are long, and the staff are grumpy. The constant whirring of the blenders in close proximity is almost deafening and must be stressful for them to be around all day.

I started using the iPhone app to avoid the long lines. The signs say you can avoid waiting altogether by ordering ahead in this way. Simply not true! Most recently, I placed an order through the app, waited until my order was supposed to be ready, showed up, and the place was mobbed. It took me ten minutes to get the attention of a staff member. Now 20 minutes past the time my food was ""promised"" to be ready, and 35 minutes after I ordered, they hadn't even started making it yet! I left, late for work AND hungry. 

I'm hoping they will move to a larger location and improve their work flow. The food itself is tasty. Just don't expect to get it quickly, or even on time, regardless of whether you phone or app your order in."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delish, a lil pricey, but delish

I asked for cinnamon and they added for free...
Try the quinoa one for a healthy late brekkie, then go next door to RoCo for coffee."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,So THIS is what white people eat for breakfast! This place was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I mean it was a bowl with yogurt and fruit. Sounds more like a dessert. No wonder why I'm so fat. I would definitely come back here. So many hot white girls in yoga pants AKA the Asian-American dream. NOM NOM NOM!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great spot for breakfast or a fruity treat. The bowls are pretty much like a good, thick, smoothie with fresh fruit, granola and honey on top give or take a few different ingredients. We've tried the Island Bowl and the Berry bowl and both are delish. The portions are big too!

Service is a little slow and the decor/ set up is a little half ass-ed hippie/tacky, surf art, but it tastes so good!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I love this place! It is my favorite anytime healthy meal in SB. The only downside is that it is not very quick and they put a little too much honey on everything that is already sweet. I keep hoping they make honey optional or at least put it in self-serve squeeze bottle and leave it off completely!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I got the Diego Power Bowl and loved it!

A little pricey, but so worth is when you are in need of a good blance meal with a boost of veggies and other good stuff.

will def be back when I am back in SB."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Expensive. But def. Worth the try as its a delicious treat. and fun to bring out of town guests to. I Had my first Acai Bowl in Hawaii. And this lil stop has brought that island treat 5,000 miles to our small town of Santa Barbara. Def Worth a try (as i go there often) My favorites are the ""Diego or the Berry"" The diego is like having peanut butter crunch with berries its AWESOME. But this place is def on the pricey side but understandable due to the cost of the raw ingredients"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"So fresh and delicious! Fast and friendly service even when the line is out the door! Is a must do when stopping into town! But is a tad on the pricey side so if you believe you may not like this, then stick to what you know. They do have tons of options to chose from to oatmeal and smoothies, the acai bowl is my personal favorite."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Good product but how about have something up front that shows how long the wait may be. If I had known it would have been a 30 minute wait, I would not have ordered and gone somewhere else.  The people there work hard but needs more workers.  
Also get more metal spoons instead of having a plastic spoon when eating there."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I'm a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo student who lives in LA so any time my friends and I pass by SB, Backyard Bowls is a must. 

I'm a huge fan of the Backyard Bowl, Berry Bowl, and Island Bowl. They're a bit pricy at about $7-9 but they're pretty big and could easily be a healthy meal replacement. The blended acai is refreshing and light, yet creamy and filling. The fruit is always fresh and just the right amount of sweet. Admittedly, I'm not too fond of goji berries, but I'm willing to power through them for the rest of my acai bowl. There's not really much else to say about Backyard Bowls except that you want it all the time. I've never loved a food so much that I didn't know how to pronounce (ah-sigh? ah-psy-ee?)."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The Island Bowl is awesome. Great coffee next door at the SB Roasting Co.   The fruit is fresh and the service is fast. I usually get a small. Two can share the large.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Back yard bowls is sooo good. The perfect healthy treat on a hot Santa Barbara day! Try their Island Bowl. Yum!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My favorite is the Berry bowl and I order the kid's size, since it is way more than enough for one person (and cheaper). It is a very healthy and delicious breakfast. I would recommend calling 10 minutes ahead of time since it gets busy, otherwise, you will most likely have to wait for your order."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I have to admit, when I saw spinach and broccoli in the smoothies, I wasn't excited (at all).  Thankfully, there was a whole other side of the menu that looked a lot more appealing...and just consisted of fruits, granola, and honey.  

My wife and I got the Berry Bowl, which consisted of acai, strawberries, bananas, granola, gogi berries, and honey.   It was delicious!!  We had just the right amount of crunchy texture to balance out the creaminess.  Who knew blended fruits could be so good!??"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Diego power bowel was great. I wasn't fond of the breakfast berry bowl.  I wish there was something similar to this closer to me.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Stopping here while visiting one of my closest friends in SB / on the way to LA is a MUST! Berry Bowl all the way. Love the refreshing acai, fresh fruits, honey, and those effin' goji berries. I was a little skeptical of the bee pollen but my friends ensured me that I would not attract any bees if I included it in my berry bowl, PHEW! 

I love how versatile this place is. You can grab a smoothie or a wholesome, refreshing acai bowl treat! One of the best acai places I've ever had!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Healthy, delicious and fast. We enjoyed the warm backyard quinoa bowl and the cool berry bowl. This will be our new go to place when driving through. Please open one in SLO- we need you up here!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"One of my favorite places in SB! Whenever I'm in the area, I always have to make a pit stop at Backyard Bowls. 

You can either eat the acai bowl there or take it to go. If you take it to go, you can enjoy it by the wharf nearby (just a short drive).

I recommend the Island or Berry Bowl! I promise that you won't regret it! Besides, acai bowls are healthy?"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"In today's economy, wanting more bang for your $ is the norm... I learned the hard way. Portions are always enough.  My desires for a large size put me over the top.  I ate about half of my cup and tossed the rest away.  Quality was good, can't complain about fruit and grains. Can't really screw that one up at all.  Just put it all in a bowl and consume."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The fruit is always so fresh! I love coming here in the mornings.  Keeps you full all day
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Driving down the 101, a stop in Santa Barbara was in order. In the unsettled lands of the Southeast we have never heard the words ""bowl"" and ""smoothie"" used in the same sentence, let alone actually combine the two. 

Backyard Bowls is tucked away in a quaint part of Santa Barbara, strategically located near a Yoga Soup; healthy lifestyles are promoted here, or something. 

A breeze gently blowing through the quiet streets, I make my way toward the revolution that is Acai Bowls. It is an open-face store front, which was both inviting and economical. With the paradisal weather that promotes outdoor activity and happiness, an open air business structure is a wise and creative decision to implement.

I am used to the cold yellow walls of Smoothie King, where drinks are whipped up by absent minded college students, who do not know the first thing about quality ingredients, or the art of crafting food. Backyard Bowls has an aura of naturalness and quality. The concept of blending high quality organic fruits and super fruits, and then pouring it into a bowl like yogurt is a concept that is not radical, but brilliant. The bowls, which range from a $6 small to a $9 large, seem expensive at first; but after further thought, heath-conscious people pay $10 and beyond for salads that are often the least heathy items on the menu.  

I settled on the Island Bowl, which was a blend of blueberry, acai berry, strawberry for the base, and topped with granola, blueberries, strawberries, organic honey, and coconut shavings. 

The bowl is a concoction of differing sensations sparked by the opposing textures. First, the creaminess of the fruit base is a mixture between a smoothie and a sorbet. It is cool and refreshing and much lighter than ice cream. This is accented by the soft fruit, which added freshness and a tangy tartness. The coconut shavings blanket the top like crunchy snow on Christmas morning, covering the bright gifts below. The coconut is extremely refreshing, and balances the creaminess with its crisp flakiness. The granola was a gravel road that paved the way into the Winter Wonderland of Acai. The crunch was a prominent factor that could not be absent. Without it, the bowl would be a texture nightmare. Having something creamy that is void of accents or other textures is a recipe for disappointment. The granola also countered the enveloping sweetness with its grainy taste; the granola had a honey taste, which was sweet in its self, but also a softer, bran taste that paired perfectly with the base. The honey was the glue that held the bowl together. 

Backyard Bowls would do well to have a larger selection of bowls. Many of the offered bowls only have slight differences or variations from the others. Fruit, fruit, and fruit. I like fruit, and this is a business focused on heath; but they have a smoothie named 'Peanut Butter'. That is what I want to see in bowl form. Bananas, peanut butter, honey, granola...it would be too good. I think that is why they have opted to exclude it; from fear of people killing over with satisfaction. 

Acai bowls are going to sweep the country. This will be a heathy fad that won't rise up and then fall like cupcakes. It will be a better option than those smoothie joints that get their fruit from unknown places, and then do not tell you about it. Get to Backyard Bowls and try these before they hit huge."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious guilt free breakfast. Portions are big, and very fresh. I'm already planning a return trip"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place has the best selection of acai bowls in Santa Barbara.  They taste great and have the freshest of fruits.  Backyard bowls has become a regular breakfast place for me, and I love it!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"It's amazing here just how delicious the Acai bowls are. I've been to a few in LA and other places and backyard bowl does it right. The menu is simple and they mix their acai bowls well compared to others who just throw random things like coconut shavings etc, which is great but sometimes you lose the authenticity. My favorite is the Baobab bowl because of the spinach mix. People love the island bowl, the backyard bowl, the berry bowl. Any of those top 3 on the menu are great. Thankfully they are opening one in DTLA.

Tip: eat it there don't do Togo because you get less fruits from what I see."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"When I first heard about this place, I immediately wrote it off as hippie food and swore I would never eat there. But when I was dragged here by some friends after a run, I had to eat my words. It is freaking delicious. And I did not smell even the faintest hint of patchouli in the place! 

My favorites are the backyard bowl and the diego's power bowl (the latter has peanut butter in it). They are basically really thick smoothies with a whole bunch of yummy stuff piled on top, like granola, honey, strawberries, bananas, bee pollen, goji berries, etc. Each bowl has slightly different ingredients, and they have pictures of them so you can see what they  look like ahead of time. You can also get any of the bowls with a layer of yogurt underneath, but I haven't tried that. They also have a couple of bowls with veggies in the smoothie part - I'm not quite brave enough to go there, but some of my friends swear by them.

The fruit is so fresh and you just feel so energized after eating here! It's perfect for after exercising because it doesn't undo your whole workout like a giant plate of pancakes would. But I'd eat here anytime. 

The only downside is that it's expensive - you can get a small size of most of the bowls but it will still cost you $7-9. But personally I think it's worth the money. I mean, it's like the whole farmer's market in a bowl! 

Love love love."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"For a breakfast place really good bowls but if you are health conscious just beware lots of sugary granola etc. Would be totally helpful if they had nutritional info for everything. Also they put stuff like bee pollen in a lot of stuff so be wary of that's not your think but fruit was good and fresh and I really like the cacao bowl wth avocado and cacao. I in general
Don't like breakfast food at all and this is only place I have ever liked for breakfast hence the for stars."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Refreshing breakfast bowls of cold acai slush.  Not too sweet and each bite blended well with the banana and strawberry.  Kids size was plenty to share for my wife and me.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love this place! Acai bowls with crunchy granola and topped with fresh fruit and local honey. I usually get the Diego bowl (peanut buttery taste) or the Berry Bowl. It's a bit pricey, but I really do enjoy having a refreshing breakfast/lunch that's healthy. I've never tried their smoothies but I've heard great things about it. Definitely beats Blenders in my book though :)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Went here for the first time and it was delicious. Ingredients appeared very fresh and they had a great variety of acai bowls and other goodies like smoothies and breakfast bowls. I got the island bowl and my bf got the backyard bowl. Small was a good lunch portion size, the kid size would probably be better as a snack. The girl who worked there was so nice with answering all my questions (kind of an acai bowl newbie). Will definitely be back to try their other acai bowls!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,my favorite acai in the whole world! I love this place. I live in San Clemente and stop here every time I'm driving up to Northern California
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"We wanted Acai, they had Acai. Both shake and bowl was on point. Will leave one star out due to a bit slow service and really noisy place."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Rockin' fruit and acai bowls. Very popular place always a line but it moves fast and worth it. Super fresh and tasty. Honey option is good! Love it.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Me and my girlfriend love coming here for the health conscious bowls that satisfy our morning cravings, but honestly the customer service is lacking big time. In our last visit we quickly ordered our bowls ( only thing significant was that we asked for no goji berries, granola, or honey on the berry bowl) the cashier quickly repeated the order to confirm. We noticed that people who ordered after us were getting their orders first, but the one that really was discouraging was a young girl walks in with her dog chatting up an associate and within minutes (which she also claimed not having money to pay for it) has a large bowl ready to go all while it's been 15 minutes and not even a noteworthy mention of our order and not to mention the same associate that gave the special treatment made another large bowl and simply walked out with it. After another 5 minutes they finally seem to realize  we are still here and they bring out our order which was still wrong after 20 minutes, but by then we have places to be and we can't be bothered to ask for it to be corrected. I tend to be easy going in these situations since I do work in customer service too but this was a clear neglect of our order and not to mention the associates clearly play favorites with what order they make."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"On 35 minutes of waiting as of now. Wrong orders going out. No receipt was handed to me so I could even prove my order. It's a real cluster you know what in here.

I don't care how good this bowl will be (if I ever even get it).

Will not be back"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love the concept of this place, love the food even more.

The bf and I shared a Backyard Bowl for a Saturday afternoon snack.  The fruit was fresh, the bee pollen was sweet, the goji berries were chewy, the granola was crunchy, and the blended smoothie part was refreshing.  Just a perfect, perfect combination of fresh, (mostly) organic and local foods.  It is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for... and it's definitely worth it!  I want to go back and try the other bowls... but you have to be careful with calories on these.  Although it sounds and tastes healthy, I think it's better to share a bowl unless it's your lunch (forgive me, I'm on a calorie-counting kick right now).

I also really like this location.  A walk from the major shops downtown, and there is an open-walled outdoor area to eat and enjoy the Santa Barbara breeze."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,It was our first time here and we loved our açai bowls!! Definitely plan on making weekly trips out to this spot. Super filling and nice covered outdoor seating!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I typically make acai bowls at home but I was in Santa Barbara for the weekend and was so excited to happen upon this place!

They use Sambazon brand acai and they have various flavors of an acai bowl typically topped with fruit granola & a drizzle of honey. You can also add on other sides for a small charge. They also have smoothies, and hot breakfast bowls for anyone that doesn't feel like a cold acai bowl. They also recently make pitaya (dragonfruit) bowls which were really yummy.

Expect to pay on average around $8 which can be a little pricey but it's worth it for the amount of food you get. The standard size bowls are pretty huge, it's hard to finish, next time I would go for a kiddie size bowl!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Berry bowl please!!! with extra granola and honey. Great for lunch or a afternoon cool down snack
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Acai is life and this place blends their bowls right. I love it SO much. It has a super relaxed atmosphere and it's a great place to hang out and get your acai on.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is heaven to me! I really love the fruit bowls so much. Finally got a chance to try the acai bowl in Downtown Santa Barbara. I tried the berry bowl , which is based on banana, strawberry, acai berry, and apple juice; then is topped with banana, strawberry, blueberry, gogiberry, granola, and honey. This absolutely addictive; freshness, sweetness, and crunchiness came all in one! I hope they will open in Bayarea."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Hmmmmm.... these bowls are just delicious!!  I've never had one that hasn't been amazing. And I don't feel weighed down afterwards.  Super lovely and delicious; I can't say enough about these delicious bowls.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is pretty much like having ice cream for breakfast without all of the guilt.  I mean that the acai bowls were tasty and piled on with lots of fresh fruit.  The portions are huge.  I could put it down but found that the regular size was large enough.  There's a wide selection of bowls that let you try lots of different things.  I tried the Island Bowl which had lots of banana, mango and coconut.   Yum.

Island Bowls is located on State Street in Santa Barbara as you head down towards the Wharf.  There's a nice little indoor seating area with a giant roll up door which keeps the place open and airy.  The place was packed so expect a few minutes wait.  However, the staff was quick to serve and clear tables away when guests leave.  I'll go back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"my favorite place ever!!!
i wish i could eat here everyday, and i also wish they would open one in hermosa beach."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,So im a big fan of this particular backyard bowls but recently they've really started skimping on the fruit in to-go orders...not sure whats up with that but its a little disappointing...my to-go order used to be overflowing with fruit..thats like the best part. Step up your game BB!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard Bowls knows how to do things. They keep everything green and organic and delicious! It's sooo good, I crave it all the time. It's incredibly popular among my co-workers as well."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious!!! I came here with my folks while I was on vacation, and we all liked it. I had the small diego bowl, which was both filling and delectable. My parents both had oatmeal served with yummy fresh fruit. The place is dog friendly."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Had the Spartan bowl, very good. I was impressed.This was in June"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Yummy bowls! Is basically smoothie in a bowl with toppings. It makes me feel so healthy and energized. Great for hot Cali days.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,One of the best açai blends me and my friend have tasted! Coming from two girls who consider ourselves professional açai lovers after living in Australia for a year
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Got the Green Bowl and it was pretty good.  Got it togo, and it held up for quite awhile.  Enjoyed all the fruit, but probably would have like blueberries and other fruit on top than just strawberries. all in all, good stuff."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,So delicious! We stopped for breakfast while in Santa Barbara and had a great experience. It was our first acai bowl ever!  I had the island bowl and added peanut butter on top.  The acai with coconut base was delicious. All the fruit on top was really fresh and the granola was so good. Highly recommend!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"They have some very creative acai bowls here. I really enjoy the island bowl. The portions are actually quite large so if you're the person that thinks they can't really be filled up by fruit, think again. The staff is pleasant and healthy. All-in-all not too bad. My only issue is that the bowls can seem expensive especially when you're comparing them to Jamba Juice or Blenders, but when you start to think about the ingredients and the portions, it's not as bad."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Hands down the best acai bowls I've ever had. Every other place you try will be a disappointment after Backyard Bowls. Favorite is the Island bowl.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The concept of breakfast bowls, while wittingly simple, is better bought from Backyard Bowls than prepared on one's own. I had a yogurt bowl with berries and banana and flax seeds and a cinnamon-y granola. I tried to recreate it on my own, but it's just not the same. 

My boyfriend had the Island bowl--similar to what I ordered but with coconut, which was also amazing and the perfect choice for the coconut lover. 

I must admit, while I am not particularly fond of breakfast foods because they tend to be too heavy too early in the morning, I love eating at brunch time. For that reason, Backyard Bowls is perfect. It is a light, creative, customizable breakfast or snack option. Bravo!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I used to love this place. It was healthy and delicious. But as of late, I have noticed that they ruin their bowls with copious amount of granola rather than the delicious fruits and veggies I always expected. Before, the bowl was a perfect, homogeneous mix of granola and fruit/veggies, but now it tastes like I'm eating a bowl of cereal. Not ok, backyard bowls. Stop being stingy and give me the probiotics I need, not an overload of sugary granola crap. For goodness sake!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My sister came back to the place we were staying last weekend with a bowl of oatmeal from here.  I wasn't expecting much because it's oatmeal but it was GOOD!  It has gochi berries and nuts and blueberries......well, that's what I remember because I ate it so fast.  Next time I am back in town I want to try something else, or just get the oatmeal again.  Though she did mention it was a little expensive for a bowl of oatmeal and she's from NYC so that must mean it really is a little expensive."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"One of the best acai bowls I've had in the US.
Love the variety at this little place. Please open a store in San Francisco!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Like jamba juice without a blender for the trophy wife that's hard pressed on time and doesnt want to miss her private yoga appointment.

the bowls are good if you're rich, 
cant be bothered, and allergic of gluten or 
whatever the next trendy thing to avoid is.   



she probably didnt vaccinate her children either.
ugh."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is one of my fav stops in Santa Barbara. Always fresh, always tasty, and sooo good. The classic Berry Bowl is delicious, but I like to add peanut butter to it. Since the bowls are mostly fruit and carbs, that pb keeps me from being hungry an hour later. If you eat it, you can use a frequent eater card for helping to save the environment. Yay!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Best breakfast spot ever! The pb&j quinoa and the  cocoa acai bowls are the best! You can't miss this place :)
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,One of the best açai bowls I've ever had. Tons of options and toppings for you to customize your bowls! Super creamy acai which I liked. They have other food there as well for people who don't like acai bowls which is nice. Only disappointment is that  I wish they had a backyard bowls where I lived!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I walked three miles to get an acai bowl in Santa Barbara, you'd think being in a town like that, there would be a ton of options for bowls and smoothies. Unfortunately, I was wrong but this place was worth the walk! It was amazing and tastes so fresh. I got the tropical bowl and of course added some crunch PB. Little pricey but would come again for a special occasion."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,A bit overpriced and overrated in my opinion.  I think I should try the smoothie next time. The acai was just too much. A kid size is perfect I think for most.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Came here with our Vegan granddaughter. Vegan or not these are really yummy!  It was pretty busy & the seating is limited. The only negative ( not fault of the business) was a couple of very rude guys who were sitting at a table for four & oblivious that people were waiting for a place to sit. They had finished their bowls. They both had dogs-one that they let lick & slime the table. They did not seem to notice their chairs almost prevented people trying to dit st the bar area next to them. Rude, thoughtless people made this less than a great experience!!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Legit bowl, tasty. Healthy. A little pricey but overall worth it."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"PROS: Lots of fresh choices. Smoothies, oatmeal, acai bowls and yummy toppings.

CONS: Seem super healthy- but still pack a (deceptive) punch to the diet.

My first time here the staff was extremely patient with understanding my confusion on what an acai bowl was ""Wait...so is it like a paste in a bowl? Oh it's like a smoothie? A smoothie in a bowl?!""
Well I ended up really liking my choice and boy was it filling!
I would still come back for sure - just don't be fooled by thinking your meal is under 500 calories because it's packed with what seems to be 'super healthy' stuff."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I love this place so I won't let one bad experience ruin the goodness of it BUT what is with the portion sizes these days? The cups are half filled and i'm paying $10 for a good amount of fruit please. Really wish they were overflowing like they used to. Smh
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Shit's expensive - duh. Service is kinda snotty-surfer-teenager, but whatevs (-*). Berry bowl was hefty, refreshing, & delicious. Island ambiance got me feeling homesick (in a good way)."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while since my sister continuously raves about it. I finally did. Not going to lie, it was really refreshing. I had the small berry bowl. The blended part includes acai, banana, strawberries, and apple juice. It is topped with bananas, strawberries, blueberries, goji berries, granola, and honey. I really enjoyed it! Very filling, sweet, the perfect breakfast or midday snack. I was able to try the Island bowl as well and wow that was good! Loved the coconut shavings on that. All ingredients tasted fresh. The honey was added to balance out all the flavors from being too acidic. I thought it was a perfect idea to the bowl.

It is pricey but trust me it is filling. You can always share. Seating is limited. People were sitting on the curb eating. Also, sometimes they let the bowl sit there for a bit and some of the blended parts are already melted. They need to get out orders quick so they don't melt. 


-Give it a try!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Our group of six girls are acai bowl enthusiasts. We've been spoiled in San Diego with perfect acai bowls of all shapes and flavors, and we looked forward to trying Santa Barbara's Backyard Bowls!

We were a bit let down. The service was great at first--shoutout to the dude at the cashier! He was super friendly and patient with everyone, as the line was long and people seemed impatient. The menu is a ginormous beast of a selection...so it helps to look online at the menu before getting there so you have an idea of what you want.

I'm allergic to nuts, so I focused on the coconut water-based/juice-based bowls. I settled with the Protein Bowl which sounded so delicious with peanut butter and strawberries blended INTO the acai (WHAT!?). The consistency of my acai was actually a bit runny for my tastes, but my girlfriends' had more solid-looking acai bowls. I think next time when I am here, I want to have my fruit outside of my acai base, so I can actually eat the fruit and not have that change the consistency of my acai bowl...which I like on the frozen side. 

They also have ""special acai bowls"" that are on their chalkboard. I'm assuming those change by the day or week. They also have smoothies, which one of the girls ordered...and she LOVED it. It looked so frozen and good--perfect for the beach or after a workout! I would totally come back again, just so I can try all of the nut-free bowls they have. Parking isn't too difficult--we came in the morning like around 10:30AM, and we didn't catch a line on a Saturday morning. After we ordered, there was a line out the door.

I do have a bone to pick though...the acai makers called out the name of a customer that had the same name as one of my friends, and the other customer took the bowl that my friend ordered first. My friend ended up waiting over 20 minutes for her bowl, then finally spoke with the bowl makers...frustrated and confused as to why we all had our items, but she didn't. The customers who ordered after us even spoke up for us and said that the other girl took the bowl that wasn't hers, but under the same name. I suggest Backyard Bowls take first name and last initial to avoid further confusion. There are a lot of Amy's, Christine's, and Kelly's in this world."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Insanely generous portions - the backyard bowl was absolutely delicious and the toppings were plentiful. I would give this place 6 stars if I could.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Bowls are amazing and delicious! Small green bowl with a splash of yogurt is my go-to. They lost a star because sometimes they really do take forever.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,We've tried all kinds of acai bowls up & down the coast of Cali and Backyard Bowls is top notch! Unusual options but very scrumptious if you venture to try something new!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Im really upset, and now Im a customer at Blenders in the Grass. I used to go to BBowls REGULARLY. But now they have redesigned their walls , taken down all signs as to what they are serving there, and what it contains. So I am forced to use a hand menu which often times I simply cannot see. So they have taken AWAY the information about their product, replaced it with NOTHING, then issued menus with fonts smaller than this. Good luck talking to the friendly staff, they will not help you order, tell you what is in the smoothies or bowls, they just laughed said "" thats what the owners wanted"" and turned her back. I wont ever go back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Verdens beste acai bowl. Frisk og gid frukt og bær og crunchy granola med søt søt honning.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Thank you to all the Yelpers out there for allowing me to find this place on our vacation!  Upon arriving, I thought about 5 bowls looked really appealing. After careful deliberation, I ended up going with the medium Berry Bowl which was excellent and plenty big. I don't think you can go wrong with anything they have there. 

It was pretty full when I got there but the line moved fast. It took about 5-10 minutes to get my order so not too long to wait for all that goodness in a bowl.

My stomach thanked me for the delicious and healthy gift that morning. When you start your day off with a meal like that you know it's going to be a great day!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Finally tried an acai bowl... Pretty good. The small is huge though,  definitely can be shared :)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Had the Diego protein bowl...I love blended acaí, but the peanut butter in the bowl was a little too much nuttiness for me. The granola was amazing- the hemp seed and milk was a perfect touch! I would have asked for no honey the next time around. The employees are phenomenal- the cashier helped me pick a bowl for me, he was super helpful! The best part is that my ""small"" bowl kept me full almost all the way until dinner!!! Well worth it!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Obsessed with Acai bowls. There are tons of options and they are delicious. Unpretentious, chill vibe. Only feedback: it takes what feels like forever to get your order given the amount of staff they have on. Seriously... please add another blender and examine the efficiency of operations... it could be even more fantastic! That said, worth every penny, just don't go if you are in a rush."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I'm still eating backyard bowls in my dream!  Visited here on a trip down the PCH and I can't get the bowls out of my head.  So YUMMY!  I want a trip back to Santa Barbara just to eat here again.  (Maybe they will make a chain and open a store in Boulder, CO.  Hint hint...)

(This place and a couple others have made me a huge believer in Yelp!)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great atmosphere, with all of the pop music and energy! Very healthy and my type of snack!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"First time here and this was exactly what I was looking for. The fruit was extremely fresh and delicious. Best of all, the price was right. The crew was friendly and the restaurant was clean. It's a great setting for a Saturday morning. I was sad that I had to get our order to go because we are only in town for a volleyball tournament. I will definitely bring my family back when we have more time."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I pretty much only acai bowls here, but that's because this place is the best place for acai bowls. It definitely has a sorbet like texture and it doesn't melt as quickly as other places. Its definitely a bit pricy, but acai usually is. Also the portions are fairly big and it could basically replace breakfast. It normally comes out to around $7-9. My favorites are the Berry Bowl (classic) and the Island Bowl for when I'm craving mango. Love this place. Always a pitstop driving between LA and SLO."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"If you have the ingredients at home, it is incredibly easy to assemble.  We bought all the stuff at the farmers market to make our 3 favorite ""bowls"" and are making them for about $0.75 each!!!  Apparently, Martha Stewart loves this place, but she's a billionaire, and was convicted of lying to the People."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Really delicious stuff and a nice break from the doughy, proteiny stuff we 'Mericans usually eat for breakfast.

I can eat a ton of just about anything but a child's portion here is plenty.  Trust me on this.

A bit pricey but super fresh and yummy."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Ordered an açaí bowl and all I got was a bowl of granola and fruit. Maybe having more than 3 workers in the morning during busy months (summer) would create happier customers and better accuracy with orders. I mean how do you make an açaí bowl and not notice the bright purple açaí missing when you put the granola in smh.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Move over, Nekter, this place wins. While visiting Santa Barbara, I got the PB+J quinoa breakfast bowl and it was so filling and tasty and warm. It was a huge portion for the price.

The setting was nice, you get to sit outside, and the staff are extremely friendly. 

Highly recommended!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"BEEN DYING to come here for a while & finally drove up from San Diego to Santa Barbara one weekend just to try it.

Surprisingly we came on a Saturday & there wasn't any line, just had to wait for our bowls to be made. Sat right outside on the bench & ate our bowls in the shade.

Bowls are on the pricey end, but for the amount, variety & quality of the ingredients they put in I'd definitely come back.
Split a backyard bowl & it was a good portion for me a few hours after walking around the beach & eating lunch.

Who would have known you could eat bee pollen?

Also, I give them props for their green policy of eating in or returning to-go containers for frequent buyer stamps."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Backyard Bowls is amazing! I've been going here for the past several years. Every time my wife and I stop in Santa Barbara we have to drop in. The concept is pretty new and the freshness of the ingredients is unmatched anywhere. I've tried everything on the menu but in my humble opinion the Island Bowl is the best! Highly recommend.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious! I feel bad for the people working here because it's so loud, and acai bowls are a hard thing to prepare. They should really have 10 stations and a person at each station, but business owners can't afford that much of the budget going to payroll when the materials themselves are expensive for quality. 

Anyways, for that reason it can take a while to get your bowl, but always worth it when it comes out.

If you want to wait next door at the coffee shop, they'll run your bowl over to you when it's ready! It's quieter at the coffee shop too."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great acai bowls with all the ""fixins"". Highly recommend this place."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Not as good as the Kravabowl in Avila beach but still worth stopping by for a nice fresh fruit bowl;-).  Feels right.   Healthy, but still so good."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"30 minute wait I asked about my order and they said it was coming. 15 minutes later they claim it must have been overlooked. Yes that what I was saying when you ushered me away the first time. 

No apology just excuse. Won't be back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I LOVE the bowls. The green bowl is my favorite, it leaves me energized and feeling really healthy for the rest of my day. The only thing I can complain about is the prices, $8 for a bowl is a little steep."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"YUMMY & FRESH! I stopped by this place on my way to an event. Everything tasted so healthy, in a good way. My order came out pretty quickly and the staff was nice.  I had the island bowl which was jam packed with favor! Great concept! Wish there was one in LA."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The BEST acai bowl spot I've found yet. I love the goji berries. you cannot go wrong with any of their menu options.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Island bowl is my favorite!! Green bowl is delish! Love this place!!!! Always yummy and energizing!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I wish I could have this for breakfast every day! So tasty, healthy & refreshing. Great comfortable environment. Highly recommend this place!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,We absolutely LOVE this place! Generous portions of great for you foods! Our favorites are the Island Bowl and the Quinoa Bowl. Nice atmosphere and a great place to stop by on your way to the beach!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place serves a sizable and delicious acai bowl. They have a variety of mixtures you can get, customizing to each person's taste preferences. We've gotten the island bowl each time we've gone (large) and been very satisfied taste-wise, as well as full for quite a few hours after. The base (smoothie-like) part of the bowl is blended with acai, banana, mango, pineapple juice and coconut milk. It has the texture of a thick smoothie, but it doesn't have clumps in it, it's quite smooth. It's topped with (a lot of) banana, strawberry, blueberry, coconut shavings, granola and honey. It's definitely a breakfast on the sweeter side. I eat very little granola and pass the rest onto my fiancé, but I do enjoy how piled high this bowl is with fresh toppings. For $10 you leave very full! We had this twice on our trip to Santa Barbara.

Generally, service is friendly and quick, and there's a good amount of seating. Beware, the seating is all exposed to the outside, and eating the acai bowl makes you quite cold! You can get the bowl to stay or to go. They also sell a variety of tea flavors and (regular caff) coffee. There's also a traditional coffee shop two doors down if you want that instead (they also have a bathroom, which Backyard Bowls doesn't).

We'll be back next time we're in SB again!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"If you need a quick and health breakfast or snack option, this is the place!

One of the few places I can find a green bowl or smoothie in SB, and have it taste great! Wide selection of smoothies, exotic ingredients (e.g. flax seeds, goji berries), and hot and cold bowls. My favorites are the brazil (an Acai smoothie topped with fruit and granola) or the Hot Quinoa Bowl (fresh, soft Quinoa with bananas, strawberries and coconut milk).

I love that you can order from their app and have your breakfast ready to go when you walk in the door.

Definitely a must visit if you want a fast, filling but healthy start to your day."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Amazing breakfast, healthy doses of fruit...strawberries, blueberries etc... very fresh and good for you. Friendly staff, water pitcher also a plus. Nice place. Go there non stop since I discovered this delicious & healthy spot."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is SO great! Everything is extremely fresh. I went for my first time after Reality at SBCC and ordered myself the Island bowl. It was such a joy to eat. The price was also awesome. I ordered a small bowl for $6.95, and I ended up not finishing it even though I was starving when I first ordered the bowl. 

Can't wait to go back and try some other bowls!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"While it's a bit expensive for my taste, I'd happily pay premium for these bowls anytime. I love their homemade granola and fruity ""sorbet"". After eating one of these hefty bowls I felt full, satisfied and healthy from the tips of my toes to the tip of my nose. It was awesome. So, I retract that earlier statement. I'd pay my whole paycheck to feel this good after eating every time. Definitely worth a stop."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is a great place for breakfast/snack 
They make acai smoothies and bowls with a lot of healty toppings...kinda expensive"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I would have given this place 5 stars but had to deduct a star due seeing ants on the counter and due to the lengthy wait (25 minutes!).  I normally would not want to wait 25 minutes for an Açaí Bowl but I was on vacation, waiting for a friend to arrive and not in any particular hurry, I decided to try the Açaí Bowl which tasted amazing considering it was already warm at 11:00am.  I have to say that the fruits and ingredients used are fresh; staff was slicing the bananas and strawberries on the spot.  I was a bit concerned about the ants crawling on the pick-up counter but thought it was due to the honey used as an optional topping for customers.  If you're craving an Açaí Bowl and have time to spare, I would suggest trying Backyard Bowls."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"What can I say about Backyard Bowls that hasn't already been said?  This place is awesome!  Fresh and ""good for you"" Acai bowls that are great meals on their own!  I LOVE BACKYARD BOWLS!!!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Went here for breakfast this morning and purchased an island bowl. The small size is actually quite large, and though I did finish it off, I would have been fine with less! 

My husband and I are both huge fans of acai bowls and these hit the spot. We'll definitely be coming back!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"LOVED this place!  Why?  Huge delicious bowls of goodness!  One day for lunch I had an acai bowl, the Diego: acai, banana, strawberry, hemp protein, peanut butter hemp milk topped with strawberries (it comes with bananas, I subbed in strawberries), hemp seeds, granola, and honey.  It was huge - lots of the bottom part plus tons of the fruit topping.  It was amazing.  It was not overly sweet like other acai bowls I've had.  I loved it.  The next day for breakfast I had the Spartan Museli: hot (you can order it hot or cold) rolled oats, almonds, flax, dried fruit, cinnamon, cashew milk, banana, strawberry, blueberry, hemp seeds, and honey.  SO GOOD!  The portion was huge.  You feel so good eating such healthy food AND it tastes so good.  PLEASE COME TO THE EAST COAST!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The concept is cool and the bowls and smoothies are fine. The service is very slow - both times I was there I thought it took way too long to get my bowl/smoothie (over 5 minutes). Those types of places should be a lot quicker - I've seen smoothie places work through the crowd much quicker. Both times I just sort of awkwardly watched the staffs' behinds as they chopped strawberries frantically and seems like not the most appealing thing to see. Also all the smoothies and bowls are extremely similar - it'd make a lot of sense to offer more variety. The area where the flyers and posters were displayed also was in disarray (I had a long time to stare at it all) and there were so many items on it that were very expired - if you have a display that like, seems like it needs to be maintained. Also, and getting a little picky now, it just looks funny when their bev cooler isn't fully stocked - just looks like an afterthought."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Excellent endroit pour un petit déjeuner vitaminé... fruits et oat-meal à l'honneur .... je recommande vivement. Pour le café et le thé, il y a le Santa Barbara coffee à deux portes."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard bowls is sooooo good! 
Their portions are huge! Every bowl I've gotten is delicious. My favorite is the original Backyard Bowl. There's not much to say, but they are very filling! Don't underestimate fruit, acai, and its other delicious components; you will be full for awhile!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"When we come to Santa Barbara this is a must stop on the list. We come here for breakfast. My husband always has the PB&J Bowl, it warm with bananas and quinoa and a few other things. I got the Island Acai Bowl. We also got the tropical ginger and peanut butter smoothies. I would recommend both bowls and the tropical ginger smoothie. The place is small but has outdoor seating in the place next door. It's clean but sometimes the tables are a little sticky from the customer before. Just ask them to clean the table. Staff is really nice and friendly."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Amazing for breakfast or lunch, this place offers a great selection of smoothie-type items. I've had a few things, but the berry bowl is my favorite. And the large is just that...LARGE!
The green bowl sounds strange, but it's delicious. If you like ginger and need some extra veggies, go for it.
The peanut butter bowls are also good, but very peanut buttery. Be ready."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Every time I am in town I visit for breakfast.  We are hooked.  Friendly, quick service never disappoints."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Because of this place, I'm officially addicted to acai bowls.

Love the Diego Bowl but I sub mango for the strawberries since they don't have organic strawberries (berries are a smart item to eat as organic). I also opt for agave or no honey. I LOVE IT! I went 4X on our trip to Santa Barbara. The texture contrast is awesome: crunchy n smooth. My husband tried a few different options which he liked them all. I want to try the hot quinoa but can't bring myself to part with Diego's Bowl.

What do I wish? Even more organic ingredients. I wish they had better/more comfy seating. And it's quite loud with the blenders. Too bad the blenders don't have those silencing containers around them. I hope the employees wear ear plugs. 

Service was always great. I think price is reasonable given the ingredients."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Hands down my favorite spot to grab a bowl between SB and SD.  Always tasty and filling, I really can't decide which one I like best because they are all good.  They make a killer oatmeal as well.  Perfect way to start a day."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I'm local to the area and have always loved Backyard Bowls  for the healthy meal option they provide but this location I've now had a few very poor experiences with. Unfortunately it is the closest location to my house AND to my work. 

This morning I arrived at 7:30am with an out of town guest. There was nobody in line. My friend was contemplating her decision and a man came in who asked if we were ready to order, since he was a single guest we let him go ahead of us. We ordered next. Ordering was a little confusing since on the menu they list ""Hemp Protein"" yet when I ordered it as an add-on to the ""Island Bowl"" they said they no longer carry Hemp Protein and only have Pea Protein. Then why is it on your menu? False advertising for sure! I highly doubt they are telling everyone who orders a bowl with Hemp Protein that they are out of it and only have Pea Protein. C'mon folks! Update the menu. 

We placed our order by 7:39am. After we had paid and were standing waiting for our bowls one of the workers lets us know there is a huge order ahead of us and it'll be a 15 minute wait for our bowls. I looked around for who possibly could have made a huge order...he told me it was an order phoned in last night for pick-up? So in other words, he had terrible time management and all of a sudden realized he had to devote all three workers in the shop to working on one group order and ignore any orders for waiting customers. I let him know as long as it's 15 minutes (as he said) that it was fine because I needed to leave by 7:55am for work. He said it'd only be 15 minutes. Well 18 minutes later we still didn't have our bowls. I left and headed to work, leaving my out of town friend to get the bowls. She waited another 7 minutes for our two bowls. They were finally ready at 8:04am. 

So essentially, we waited 25 minutes for 2 bowls when they had 3 workers in the shop and there was NO LINE? What makes me even more upset is the boy (Coletti, sp?) working said the large order was phoned in the prior evening....so essentially he had very poor time management skills. There was a girl working alongside him that I know felt really bad for us--it appears Coletti might have been the working manager for the morning shift--poor choice in management for sure. He didn't even offer to refund my bowl when I told him I'd have to leave for work. Sorry Backyard Bowls, you lost a client this morning, you unfortunately won't be on my tourism recommendation list anymore."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I look forward to exploring more on the menu.  I went here because my son (11) was begging me to try it for a smoothie. I didn't even know they had smoothies. It was hard for him to decide because they were unique and not your typical smoothie ingredients. In fact, he had me leave because he was thinking there was a Blenders next door...haha...nope. So back in we went and he asked if they could make the ""Brek Smoothie"" (I think that was the name, like a Breakfast smoothie). The girls were very nice and offered to make it sans granola which he liked. They even overheard him say he didn't like bananas and showed him it had bananas, but he chose to keep those. 

I have to say that he didn't like it because it tasted like a milkshake to him rather than a 'fruit smoothie' - but I LOVED IT! It was the best 'milkshake' I've ever had. So I'll be back for one of those sometime and to try a bowl when I need a healthy break from eating out for a typical lunch or breakfast."

Kids size bowl! It means it feeds a kid for the whole day. Not to mention a bowl of acai blend."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I crave this oatmeal when I'm not in town. I stop here for breakfast every time work brings me to Santa Barbara. Today I tried the quinoa oatmeal instead which was just as delicious. I love the local jam on top. Wish they had one of these in the South Bay!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is my favorite breakfast place in Santa Barbara. The Diego Bowl and the Brekkie Smoothie are my all time favs. Especially the Diego Bowl because of how creamy it is due to the peanut butter and how crunchy and sweet it is due to the granola and honey. The Choose Your Own Oatmeal is also really good too. Probably because you can choose it yourself and who knows you better than yourself, right? Try the oatmeal with the local strawberry jam. It's fantastic. There are a couple Backyard Bowls in Santa Barbara, but this is by far my favorite. It's very pretty and the outdoor seating is nice. I would recommend this place to a friend any day! PROTIP: The small is actually pretty big. The small to-go cup is bigger than a small for-here bowl, so I always go for the to-go to get more for my buck."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Great spot for breakfast! I liked how close knit and intimidate the space was. Great breeze coming in through the restaurant. Delicious and great service  :)
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The food is great, frustrating to wait 20+ minutes. They need to have more help preparing. Honestly don't think if it is worth the wait."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Recently took a trip down to Santa Barbara for the long weekend and whenever we make short trips like these, we always make an effort to try as many different food places as we can. With Backyard Bowls however, this was definitely not the case. We actually ended up grabbing acai bowls 4 times in 2 days. It's THAT good! 
Over the course of 2 days we were able to try the Berry Bowl, Island Bowl, Diego's Power Bowl, Backyard Bowl, and Cocoa Almond Bowl. 

I'm a huge fan of chocolate covered bananas and covering my bananas in Nutella, so for my fellow chocolate-banana lovers out there, I highly recommend the Cocoa Almond Bowl. If you're into more of a berry-focused acai bowl, then the Berry Bowl and the Backyard Bowl is definitely for you - super refreshing and filling. Peanut butter lovers, you will definitely enjoy Diego's Power Bowl because it's packed with protein. As for the Island Bowl, I was quite surprised I thoroughly enjoyed it, considering my dislike for most things coconut-flavored.

What I love most about these acai bowls is the overall balance of flavors. Sure, the star flavors would shine (i.e. the coconut in the Island Bowl), but they would never overpower the other ingredients in my acai bowl.  The price is a little bit on the expensive side, but for me personally, I'd gladly incur the cost of one of these bowls during another mini vacay or if I'm on the go.

I can't say for sure whether my obsession with Backyard Bowls has to do with how great their acai bowls taste or there being a complete lack of acai bowl places in NorCal or possibly a little bit of both. Either way, I highly recommend giving this place a shot to anyone visiting Santa Barbara."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The best fruit bowls in the nearest 30 mile radius. 
I wish wish wish their prices were lower, but hey, what can you do?
It's all about the island bowl and the diego bowl. Don't be afraid if you've never had acai before, it will blow your mind, trust me. I'm the type that never tries new things, but this was well worth the venture. Still trying to be the duke of this place too."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great bowls, wide variety of choices. Great music, terrific view, friendly servers. I had a bowl with peanut butter, yogurt, hemp seeds, banana, almonds, blueberries, and granola. heavenly!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Refreshing, interesting combinations that go together perfectly. It's a wonderful breakfast and afternoon snack :)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is phenomenal.  I honestly had to laugh when I read the negative reviews- it's not a froyo place, and yes, acai berry pulp is expensive therefore the bowls are expensive but that being said you are still getting a meal for under 8 bucks so people should stop complaining.  This place is a Santa Barbara staple, it's fresh, made to order so yes, it takes a bit longer than McDonalds, and the food is SO good.  I've been to a million and one acai bowl shops throughout southern California and none even compare to Backyard Bowls.  If I could have one every morning for breakfast I would."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I always get the Kid sized island bowl and it's always more than enough for me.

I think there's only two bowls that you can get in the kid size so i'm glad that the island bowl is just right for me. It comes with blueberries, strawberries, bananas, granola, coconut shavings, and i forgot the mixture of the acai smoothie.

Whenever they call me up for my order, i never get honey in my bowl. i've tried it once and it was alright, but i can go without it.

The fruits are always super sweet, straight from the farmer's market. I also love the coconut shavings on top of the island bowl.

It usually gives me a brain freeze when i eat it too quickly, but I always make it a point to stop by Backyard Bowls whenever i'm in Santa Barbara.

The workers are all fairly young and some are nicer and more welcoming than others, but i don't blame them when there's a huge crowd. 

I like getting my bowl to go, but there are always people eating their bowls in the store. It makes for a great breakfast or even an afternoon snack."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Fresh and makes you feel full and satisfied. Easy for digestion and wonderful on the tastebuds
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"LOVE this place! Backyard Bowls a quaint, garage-esque storefront just off the more bustling State Street, so it feels more local than touristy. Their bowls are AMAZING! Loved their açaí smoothie. My friends ordered the breakfast bowls (oatmeal and açaí, respectively), and both loved it. They are super generous with their add-on's (e.g., my friend ordered goji berry add-on, and by the end she said she was ""all goji-ed out""). Their prices are affordable, their food is super filling, and their portions (even kid portions) are more than enough for ravenous adults. Wish there were Backyard Bowls in LA/OC/SD!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Every time I'm in Santa Barbara, I want to eat breakfast here.  All the bowls have been excellent, whether it's the fruit-based acai bowls or the heartier grain dishes (I eat quinoa).  Great if you're vegan or gluten-free.  I love that they don't automatically use a milk base.  

It's a bit noisy to eat there, so sometimes I'll take it to the beach to eat since it's not far.  (for personal reference--there's a decent coffee shop next door as well, and the parking lot is free for the first 75 minutes)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Amazing, fresh, healthy and filling breakfast! Fruit was incredibly fresh - I got a small and finished a little more than half. 
Went around 10am on a Tuesday and got our bowls very quick. Staff was friendly and helpful, overall a great experience"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Green bowl-sub cashew milk for apple juice-no granola and add almonds and cacao nibs-gods stuff and the ginger makes it easy to digest that cold bowl of yumminess!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This is My go to breakfast place when I'm craving something sweet and healthy. They also have a great selection of toppings from hemp seeds to chia seeds.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,On a hot summers day a backyard bowl is all you could possibly want! The chill of the fresh fruit that melts in your mouth is delectable. and the crunchy granola gives its so much flavor. Backyard bowls is great!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Finally tried the Dan's Special - which has carrots and spinach in the smoothie part along with all the fruit. I could barely tell there were veggies in there! It was awesome. This one also comes with the layer of yogurt underneath which added some creaminess. 

I gotta say though...you might want to eat this bowl in a dimly-lit location. The smoothie is dark green and when everything starts to mix together it looks pretty gnarly."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Loved this place!!!!!! I got the cocoa almond bowl and split it with my sister. The large was HUGE! Definitely worth the money because it's so big. You can easily split with 1-2 other people. The blueberries were huge and so flavorful and the granola was perfectly crispy and had big chunks. Will be back whenever I'm in Santa Barbara.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Hands down THE best acai bowl ever. I absolutely love their acai bowls (island bowl!!!) and the service is great too. I may or may not have driven from LA because I was craving it during my spring break (I attend ucsb). But thank goodness they opened a location in LA recently! Anyway, it is seriously the perfect consistency and loaded with fruit, granola, honey, goji berries, coconut flakes, you name it! Very generous portions too! An added bonus is that they are so environmentally friendly - they offer stamps if you reuse your bowls or dine-in! Definitely my favorite in all of Santa Barbara! I have been too spoiled with the quality of backyard bowls and I can't eat it anywhere else without thinking of this place...."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,In town for a tournament.   Every day BYB has been breakfast.  Healthy and yummy.  Phoned in our group order which was ready for pick up.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Andrew and I stayed at Santa Barbara for our third day of the Route 1 trip. I ordered a hot quinoa for me and a backyard bowl for him. I can only eat hot stuff today, plus, I love quinoa. His order was simply based on the the name of the restaurant- when you don't know what to order, you order the one named after the restaurant :P

The quinoa was great, blended with strawberry and blueberry, with a hint of raisin. In general sweet stuff are way too sweet in U.S. but this one is perfect! I also tried Andrew's bowl: I'm still having hard time figuring out what they put as base; it tastes like frozen yogurt, strawberry? Again, a mixture of banana and strawberry, with cereals, particularly good."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is the perfect post-workout food! I've had both the Power Bowl and the Berry Bowl (or whatever it was called) - both were good but the Power Bowl is definitely where it's at. The small is very filling... I almost couldn't finish it. So I imagine that a large is enough for 2 people perhaps. The wait can feel long when it's busy and when you're super hungry, but its totally worth it."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"By far the best I have had and found so far, this hits the spot. A great find in SB right before I head into the office, parking is easy and free in the lot right in front, I am in and out in less than 5 minutes. I have tried the Hawaiian Acai bowl and the Acai oatmeal and they are both delicious and filling! Portions are plentiful so stick with the kid size unless you plan on sharing which even with the kids bowl you can."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"These bowls are huge! You have to try these if you are in Santa Barbara. The ""large"" size was big enough to fill two of us."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is definitely my FAVORITE ACAI BOWL place! Totally beats my introduction to acai bowls in Honolulu, HI. I will make a point to stop by every time I'm in Santa Barbara.  Lovvvvvvvve. :) The ingredients are fresh, texture is perfect. The staff has it dialed."

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This place is one of my favorite places to eat in Santa Barbara!! I absolutely love their bowls and smoothies! Super healthy too!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Gonna be real, that Green Broccoli Bowl is nasty as heck. Healthy or not, it's not my cup of tea. Go for the Berry Bowl or Island Bowl, and the kiddy size will suffice. 

Only complaint is that the strawberry stems/leaves were still stuck on the berries. A more thorough wash wouldn't have hurt."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Yum!  If you are looking for a healthy, filling and fresh breakfast, this is the place.  I went here and had a make your own quinoa bowl with strawberries, blueberries and bananas.  The cereal was tasty, fresh, and healthy.  My only complaint is that the quinoa cereal itself could use a little more flavor (perhaps some cinnamon or vanilla), but with some extra banana or a little peanut butter mixed in, it was great."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Good place to eat healthy! A variety of fruit bowls along with quinoa and oatmeal bowls. Had the quinoa bowl with nuts and fruit and it was awesome!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,They're Island bowl was very refreshing after a whole day in the sun! Size was well portioned and fruits tasted fresh and sweet. I really like their granola. Kinda has a crispy-crunch to it. Love!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Good and healthy food! Had to search for a long time to find healthy and decent food places!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is our favorite Santa Barbara treat, and we'd drive a long way to enjoy one of these bowls.   We always get Dan's bowl (which for some reason is no longer on the menu, but they'll make it for you if you ask for it).  I doubt you could go wrong with anything here, though."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"So yummy! And fast! Loved being able to get a quick, healthy, delish breakfast to start our day."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Still one of my favorite places in SB. Ive been a few times now. Ive tried Island, Berry, Brasil and Diego.
Favorites are Island and Diego. The diego has PB mixed into the acai...so good!
The museli (sp?) is also pretty good if youre an oatmeal fan.
They have an app to order over the phone which I would recommend if youre in a hurry...the line can be pretty slow sometimes, but theres plenty to look at on  the wall if you need to spend some time! No complaints..."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Love me some Acai! Will come back regularly when I'm in santa barbara. Great place for a healthy refreshing breakfast or lunch. They have coffee from the roasters next door as well which is really good too!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love the Acai bowls here, they're as good as I've had. I had the power bowl and wife had the tropical bowl and big were great. Power bowl is a little more hearty which is what I'm looking for, but yet it's still light and kept me full for a few hours while we hiked inspiration point. Fruit on top is ripe and tasty and really you just can't go wrong with this place. Line was a little long when we showed up but it moves quickly and they get orders out fast as well. Great place!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"So disappointed. Takes these people 40 minutes to make a smoothie.... one person preparing the bowls and the rest were sweeping or just talking and hanging around??? What's with that??? Also, the water dispenser was empty outside and the cashier guy knew that but decided to stand around when the place was empty? Not local here so it's not like I go here every day but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for anyone"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I LOVE Backyard Bowl! 
This place rocks my socks off. When I am unsure of what I want to stuff my face with, I end up here. This place is great any time of the day.

P.S.
I enjoy Diego's power bowl. Yum. Peanut butter."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Love this place! It has fresh ingredients and healthy options! I get the green bowl every time and substitute almonds for granola to make it a bit healthier. General Manager Richie is amazing to the customers.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Saw this place on Yelp, and it called to me like my sweet tooth at night. I gave it a try because I've been disappointed by Bowls before. However, this place lives up to all the reviews. The place is loud!! The blenders are churning up some yummy goodness. I had a desire for Diego's Protein Bowl, so I gave it a shot. It was the best bowl I've ever had. Smoothie at the bottom mixed with hemp seeds, granola, and bananas was perfect. I'd totally come back!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious for breakfast or snack. I had a large, but a small probably would have been enough."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is a really different type of breakfast or lunch.  These ""bowls"" aren't anything like your usual bowl of hot or cold cereal.  They serve all sorts of healthy grains, I love the quinoa myself with the homemade cashew milk, and are loaded with farm market fresh, local and organic fruits and nuts.  If you haven't been there, it is worth the experience.  It's right next door to Santa Barbara Roasting Co. off lower State."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Whoever just made my bowl 6/5 at 12:30p, serious bowl making skills! Backyard bowls is ALWAYS good but wanted to give credit to this guy at the bowl making station, thank you. Best bowl I've ever had :D"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Really big servings so I recommend a kid size. The ginger smoothie didn't really taste like ginger at all which was sad but still good. I got the oatmeal with the addition of fresh berries in top which I highly recommend. Quick straight forward offering and customer service.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious. If we lived nearby, would totally come here regularly."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The food here is fresh and good but the menu is somewhat repetitive.

Customer service could be better. I have been here twice and it is usually difficult to identify who is supposed to be taking your order even though there seem to be a bunch of people back there."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard bowls is the best spot for a healthy breakfast. Not so heavy on protein, but the bowls are big enough and tasty enough to get you through the day.
Other helpers talk about it being noisy. Yes it is. Blenders and basic patio ambiance make for quite the noise level. But your meal is worth it.

Best bet for a breakfast that doesn't come from a greasy spoon in SB."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"First two things: $9 is a lot to charge for a bowl of fruit and this is the best a bowl of fruit can possibly be. I chalked it up to being Santa Barbara and so it's expensive, but after having a large Island Bowl and tasting the ingredients, it's acceptable. Acai is expensive, so are fresh local products. But it all comes together to make a tasty snack/meal depending on the size and how hungry you are. For me this was as good a breakfast I could have hoped for on a Sunday morning, fresh, filling, and nutrient packed. Try it, you will like it."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My 17 year old daughter had been begging to turn me on to this place for quite some time. Well worth the wait! I had the red quinoa with wonderful fresh fruit bowl for breakfast - OMG; amazing!

Thank you so much for making our day in SB a wonderful start and we will make it a tradition. With much gratitude to the creators of such a splendid idea."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious and healthy açai bowls, that come with a variety of toppings-from hemp seeds, coconut shavings, cacao nibs, fresh fruit, and much more! They also serve oatmeal and smoothies as well. Every time I come here, I'm always greeted with friendly and quick service. The açai bowls have always been top notch, especially their Island Bowl (my favorite choice). If you're looking for a healthier alternative for a meal or snack, try them out!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great spot for a delicious way to fuel your day. There's indoor and outdoor seating available, or you can take it to stroll as the beach is only a short walk away. I got the Backyard Bowl which only comes in a large size and it was a pretty sizable portion but I was able to finish it. The food was delicious and they have oatmeal and smoothie items on the menu that looked intriguing."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Backyard Bowls is delicious but the customer service needs improvement. I was on a lunch break and tried calling in my order. They hung up on me two times and then just let the phone ring. 
When I arrived there I assumed they would be busy. That was not the case. I witnessed them do that again to someone else. 
I'm sure the owners would not be happy to hear their employees treat customers this way."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I HATE THIS PLACE!! The employees are so rude and it takes 45 fucking minutes to get a fucking bowl!!! Absolutely ridiculous considering the price of one açaí bowl ($9 or more for a SMALL). The bowls are subpar and not worth the wait, considering I find a huge chunk of frozen fruit in the mix almost every time I visit. The employees are slow and definitely couldn't give less of a shit when you get your bowl, and they're always chit chatting instead of actually being helpful. If you want a bowl, it will be on their time and it probably won't be very good. Asked for a refund for waiting so long last time I visited and got a huge attitude from the manager, as if I was inconveniencing her. Will not be returning."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"So glad my little sister introduced me to this place. I don't eat enough fruit at home, but I could eat a backyard bowl every day!!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Gross. Didnt think it was possible to gag while eating an acai bowl but they proved me wrong. They must have used expired ingredients because my bowl was SOUR. My boyfriends was sour too. At least they loaded the bowls with toppings that were decent, so i didnt completely waste $20. Theres a reason their health inspection letter wasnt posted. So disgusted with this place!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Not AS good as I have had in Orange County at other places, but still good none the less.   Service was a little slow, but I guess that is sort of to be expected for a place that has such fresh items and is busy."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The only bad thing about this place is that too many people are waiting in line even before you walk in there. But that's when you know the quality of the food is usually on point at a joint. 

I take my guys up here whenever we're in town for a job. The açaí bowls are the best in SoCal. Hands down. We try out all the different bowls and love all of them!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Oh my. Yum. I loved what I ordered here: Pitaya Bowl. Opted for the smallest offered size and found the portions for even that were incredibly generous. If I ever come back around Santa Barbara, I will definitely try out some of their other menu offerings!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I cannot pass through SB without hitting this place up. Ever since they opened, I have been in love. And now they have hot and cold bowls. The perfect light meal after one of Deb's saturday Yoga classes at Yoga Soup. The table area is open air and so chill. I even found myself a killer mate and bombilla set last time I was there. You guys are onto something in a big way! Original backyard Bowl or the Island bowl are very tough to beat."

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Dear Backyard Bowls,

I find it incredibly unfair that you provide such an amazing product. I mean, I can buy my own goddamn granola and fruit and probably even acai berries....but it will never compare to what you produce.

Therefore, you have every right to charge 7 bucks a bowl because...well...I'm just not that good.

So thank you, even though you take all my $$, you make my tummy happy.

Love,

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love this place. They have amazing organic options and really are eco friendly. Example; instead of getting a punch card receiving a  discounted bowl after so many purchases,  you get a stamp for bringing your bowl back in, or for bringing your own. That's how it should be!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I had a spectacular experience here. I never usually write yelp reviews but I got the Island Bowl and it was the best acai bowl i've ever had! proportions were spot on and the consistency of the blend was perfect.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Perfectly creamy acai. This place is unique as far as acai spots go because they have a variety of different blends that include hard-to-find superfoods like bee pollen and pine juice. If you're a superfood seeker this is a must-go destination. It's very casual and not overpriced. No frills, just delicious acai!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The bowls taste so gooood ! My faves are the island & the diego. A bit pricey & I have to say the amount they give you seems to be less and less - when I first started going here I could barely finish a small but now the small & large bowls aren't as big. Tastes great but come on fill up the bowls !
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Perfect way to start your morning. Fresh and healthy ingredients, laid back atmosphere and reasonable prices."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"We got a kids sized Tropical bowl, finished it, then ordered the kids sized Berry bowl. I liked the tropical bowl better. Super healthy dessert. The granola made it super tasty. 

Strangely enough it took forever for them to put together our first bowl, but the second one came together quickly."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is my favorite açaí place! 
Even though I currently live in the South Bay and spend most of my time between LA and the OC, I still drive all the way to Santa Barbara once in a while to get an açaí bowl from Backyard Bowls.
Since I am originally from Brazil, I can be very particular when it comes to açaí bowls...Backyard has the açaí closest to home to me! Flawless flavor and consistency. Perfeito!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"PERFECTION IN A BOWL.

I tried to replicate their acai bowls at home, using their menu as a reference. No matter what I did, it just did not compare to the bowls they serve. 

People say that the bowls are a little pricey, and I completely disagree. They claim to use no fillers like yogurt in a majority of their bowls, and if this is truly the case, their pricing makes complete sense. The acai berry is native to Brazil and can not be transported without being processed into pulp form, because it rots quickly after picking. The amount of work it takes to process and import the berries warrants higher prices. A 4-pack of individually packaged acai berry pulp costs about $6.50 at Whole Foods.

The Backyard Bowl and Island Bowl are my favorites. They are very filling and refreshing, especially on a hot summer day. 

They also advocate sustainability and give a stamp card incentive if you get the bowls ""for here"" instead of ""to go"" or if you re-use a ""to go"" container.

It's not very often that you have businesses care about how they affect the environment and serve something delicious and healthy."

The drip coffee is definitely tastier than Starbucks, but the $10 I paid for my cheddar & bacon sandwich was not worth the expense. I could have made an equally good sandwich at home. This place seems to have a fly problem, as I currently have 3 on myself or the table, and I see more flying around all nearby patrons."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Plan to eat at this acai place as a meal not a healthy snack. This place is a small store with 75 minute parking! They have a variety of acai bowls, juices and smoothies but I just got the the berry acai bowl. 
I loved the consistency of the acai and the generous portions. The highlight was the granola they use, it's super light and flakey and has the perfect amount of sweetness. This place has the best acai I have ever had and I highly recommend this place for breakfast or a meal after a good hike!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,This is mainly due to personal preference. I have only been here once and tried only the oatmeal. It was good but a bit too sweet for me. I feel like I would need to go back a few times to find something I liked a bit better. If granola and fruit bowls are your thing.. This place would be great for you!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I am obsessed with this place - in my opinion, its the best breakfast in SB - and healthy on top of it.

If you need a protein fix, go with the Diego Bowl - it has peanut butter  and it is DELISH. This is by far my favorite, but I've tried them all and they're all amazing. On a side note, I tried to copy the ingredients and make my own bowl at home in my Vitamix... for whatever reaason, I can't get it right so Backyard Bowl is still my go-to!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Stopped here before going to the Amtrak train station ... It was around 9 AM on a weekday, there was no line and no wait. The staff was very friendly and knowledgable in helping me pick from the menu and suggesting substitutions as I have various allergies. I ended up ordering the Island Bowl sans granola. It was delicious! If I lived in Santa Barbara, I'd definitely be a regular.

While the bowls are a bit pricey, you get a ton of fruit ... I even debated ordering the ""kiddy"" instead of the ""small"" ... the bowls are well worth the price."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Just got back from a sad scene at Backyard Bowls. In the 20 minutes it took it get my one small bowl I observed a few items the Owners wouldn't be stoked about. Don't get me wrong, I love the bowls and smoothies but this was my worst experience. 

 A measuring cup was inadvertently knocked to the ground. A blender gal picked it up and put it back on the counter- next employee comes by and uses the very same measuring cup to scoop granola for a bowl, NASTY. 

The gal cutting fresh strawberries was more concerned in keeping tabs on employees and their whereabouts instead of minding her business. She walked towards the back and walked back to the cutting station wiping her nose, and yup continued cutting strawberries, SERIOUSLY? 

She then went on to shout a name followed by ""whatever it is"" because she didn't know how to pronounce the name? YIKES.  

Seven people behind the bar and eight or less waiting customers? One bowl should be 5-6 minutes tops. Implementing a dress code wouldn't be bad either. One of the girls had seriously small shorts on. To the Owners get this crew back on track."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"After eating clam chowder and sourdough bread for two days, I decided to go for something healthy before my drive to LA.  I never had an acai bowl and it sounded good.  My choice was the Island Bowl which consisted of acai (which looks and tastes like sherbet, bananas, strawberries, blueberries, honey, granola, coconut and maybe almonds.  It was huge and worth the $7 I paid for it.  In fact, it got me so full that I didn't have lunch till much later.  And did I mention how good it was?  It was so good that I plan on making it at home if I can ever find Acai."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"One of the best Acai Bowls I've ever eaten!  The toppings were fresh and very high quality.

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love this place as a treat to start my mornings. I usually call ahead for pick up and it's always ready in 10 minutes or less. The small bowls are super filling, and I can't imagine eating a large bowl by myself. The berry bowl is my go-to!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Conversation with me and my strictly-meat-n-potatoes boyfriend:

Me: Let's have breakfast at Backyard Bowls. They have these yummy acai-smoothie bowls with fresh fruit on top; it's really good.
MnP boy: Ew, fruit? For breakfast? Why?!
Me: Aww, c'mon, it's really tasty and they have different varieties AND it's surprisingly filling.
MnP boy: Whine, whine, whine... OK fine.

Let it be known, Meat-n-Potatoes men, that said boyfriend RETURNED to Backyard Bowls later for lunch that day AND breakfast the following morning.

Ahem.

I rest my case."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Came here for an afternoon pick me up. Fresh. Delicious. Refreshing. Service was good and you can see everything being made, so no secrets! 

Got a small bowl, which was under $10 and more than filling. I'd recommend the kids size if you just want a snack. 

Also, they have a whole case of Kombucha if you're feeling thirsty. 

Lots of street parking and cute location. Right near the Moreton Bay Fig Tree. 

Lastly, they share a bathroom with Santa Barbara Roasting Company next door"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is super cute, there's two sections, one to order and one area to sit. I like that there was a window by the bar seating so you can watch them make the bowls. I went with the berry bowl and it was reallyyyyy good. Very refreshing for the morning time. The small bowl was plenty, don't think I could eat a large by myself. Price was comparable to other locations with a similar selection of bowls, about $7 for a small bowl, $9 for a large. They also have smoothies which a lot of people seemed to get and oatmeal which looked good if you're looking for a hot breakfast or snack."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is a precious gem in Santa Barbara. Very ecclectic, homey and cute - all of the things that are enjoyable/likable about Santa Barbara! Excellent choices, very fresh products and LARGE portion sizes. Excellent little place!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Good bowls at reasonable prices. Have a lot of options. Got a kids berry bowl- fruit was pretty fresh, and got a fair amount of acai for the price. Only complaint is how long the food took- probably about a half an hour, they were very busy. If you aren't in a rush, great place for breakfast!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"So wonderful! I always get an Island Bowl with honey and savor every bite. The organic coffee they have is pretty good as well! This location also is friendlier, and works a lot faster than the one in Goleta. The option to order online and pick it up is also awesome."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"It was my first time going today, it was delicious!  Had the berry bowl here in Santa Barbara"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Considering there are already 100+ reviews, it is hard to say what has not been said before.  Excellent place.  The bowls work as either a snack, meal, dessert.  
I had a quinoa one the other morning.  I liked the heater in their seating area.  The cashew milk is good too.  I had not had quinoa before, I know right.  I am behind the times, oh well.  The fruits served atop the grain included strawberries and blueberries.  It also had walnuts in there.   I love walnuts, the fruit was very fresh, ditto on the cashew milk fresh and tasty.  All in all, a good and filling breakfast.  I think my stomach waited until somewhere between oxnard and camarillo (on the amtrak ride back home) to say ""feed me a granola bar."""
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I lived in Santa Barbara for 2 years and ate at Backyard Bowls nearly every day.  Great for breakfast, or a mid day meal, I especially enjoyed the Island Bowl!!! If you're in a rush you can order easily online, which can be really helpful when you only have a 30 minute lunch break.  The place is just absolutely amazing, there is nothing bad to say.

I'm originally from New Jersey and have been back on the east coast for a few months now and I miss the acai bowls so much!  I tried to make one and failed miserably.  Can you guys please expand 3000 miles?  Backyard bowls is definitely the first place I'm going when I get back to beautiful Santa Barbara.

Don't miss out on this place, whether you live in SB or you're visiting!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Everyone is really friendly,  its nice and clean and  you can call your order in and it will be ready 99% of the time ."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The bowls are great.  
Some of the people who work there, not so much.
I placed an online order because I knew I would not have much time to wait for the 6 bowls I was buying for a group.  I was told the order would be ready at 2:40pm.  
I arrived at 2:50, and the guy at the counter looked around quickly and told my teenage daughter (who often picks up stuff while I wait in the car, avoiding parking issues) that she must have ordered from a different location, because the order wasn't there.
She had to find me, and then I had to find parking and get out.
The person at the counter was then a woman, to whom I showed the order on my phone, and she said brightly, ""Oh, yeah--it's in the fridge.""
I asked the manager why the guy told my daughter it wasn't there and accused us of ordering from the wrong restaurant when in fact he just never bothered to go look for the order.  He came up , interrupted and totally changed his story, but with no explanation of why he never even bothered to look for the order, which had been sitting there, ready to go, for 10+ minutes.  And then no apology for accusing us of mis-ordering, even though it was completely his mistake, just backtracking and lying.  Disgusting human behavior and utter incompetence."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I'm a huge fan of acai bowls and have had them at many different places.  But there was no flavor in this acai bowl! I had the tropical acai bowl and it's supposed to be one of their popular fowls.  I think they water down the acai mix with too much plain yogurt, resulting in a flavorless glob. The amount of toppings are the only positive thing about the bowls as they do pile on plenty of fresh fruit, but it was really lacking the acai flavor that I love."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I've read about this place from Edible Santa Barbara, and was very intrigued to try.  Finally, I decided to wake up half and hour early for a couple of days, just so I can grab something from Backyard Bowls before work in the morning.

I've only tried the hot bowls, steelcut oatmeal bowl and quinoa bowl, as breakfast so far, and they were yummy! Not overcooked or undercooked, and it was just right.  Cashew milk was used in both of these bowls, which made me somewhat doubtful before I tasted them, but the hot bowls are absolutely a delicious, hearty breakfast.

The only thing that made me somewhat hesitant to go back to this particular location for more is their service.  I had some less-than-friendly cashiers on the first two visits, but I definitely wasn't happy when I left.  One cashier charged me and put in the wrong order, and nobody apologized.  When I asked for a refund for the difference between the wrong order and my original order while they are remaking my bowl, she just looked at me like I had a ridiculous request and still got my orders mixed up again, until I thoroughly explained to her.  Definitely not a good start of my day.

Aside from the occasional strangely unfriendly service, the acai bowls are always very tasty."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This was the best find on our recent visit to Santa Barbara. We stopped in each morning for a delicious bowl.  It was the perfect start to each day.  There is a great coffee shop two doors down if you also need some caffeine to start your day.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I am sad to say that after many years as a regular here, I have all but stopped soliciting this joint. 

Time after time after time, my order or folks in my party's orders are made wrong. On a recent Sunday, my order was: forgotten, then made incorrectly, then remade and accidentally given to someone else, and then remade incorrectly.  4 rounds on 1 bowl! I was so shocked that I just accepted the bowl, had a few bites and left. 

This used to be such an excellent, reliable, healthy place. I would go so often that it was borderline problematic.  But now? It's not worth the frustration and disappointment, so I look elsewhere."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Soooo good. If you ever go, make sure to set your hipster timer. Its takes forever to get your bowl of goodness."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Very good, lots of variety and very tasty. Great start to the morning with these bowls. I purchased the coca-cado bowl and was better than I thought it would be."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Great bowls but a little too sweet so that's why I gave it 4 Stars. I would not add the honey on top as even without the honey the based tasted too sweet. There was no tartness from the berries and more sweetness from the banana. Not sure if they sweeten the base.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The most amazing bowl of hot cereal I've tasted. Maybe it is the fresh, homemade cashew milk or the combination of a variety of fruits and nuts. Can something that taste so good actually be healthy? Ii how so because I'm going back for more!

The Funk Zone vibes in the surrounding area contributes a particular energy to the cool dining area. This same spirit is captured in the staff's faces and congenial demeanor."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Definitely the best bowl I have ever had...nationwide. Tried one during a work trip for lunch. Returned the next day again and tried a different one. Tried the island bowl then the Dragon bowl. Dragon bowl took the cake. Added bee pollen and extra honey. My god the quantities are huge, the consistency of the açaí is great, and quality of ingredients is off the charts. Definitely getting your money's worth here. Will be coming back next time I'm in town!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"What an awesome find! Found it through yelp and all it's great reviews, and it is probably the best stuff on earth! Literally guilt free eating because it's healthy and environmentally friendly. The price was not as bad either because their ""small"" bowl is actually more than good enough to share. We had the Berry Bowl with a splash of yogurt, bee pollen, hemp, and whole bunch of other add-ons, and we were pretty happy with what we've created. Staff were cute and so friendly. It was so fresh and healthy, I wish there was one closer to where I live."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I've been here multiple times for when I'm craving a smoothie bowl with lots of toppings. With that said, these bowls are overpriced. I am specifically writing this review because today I went and waited 20 minutes when there was only one person in front of me! There were 4-5 staff working who were talking and clearly not making smoothies...or at least trying to get them to their customers quickly. Disappointed. Next time I will go to Blenders"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"why are you not in the Bay Area?!

Love Backyard Bowls! The Acai bowls are incredible. Loaded with fruits, veggie, and superfoods- totally worth checking out if you're in the SoCal area!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place was packed when I stopped in, so there was a bit of a wait as they were playing catch up with all the orders. Meaning, I came to the right place for delicious acai bowls! They have lots of bowls to choose from and smoothies as well. Most of the bowls come in small and large. I had the backyard bowl (large) which was literally the size of my head and cost around $11 w/tax. The acai was the perfect consistency and the sweetness was just right. It came topped with banana, berries and granola. Pro tip- you can order ahead. Try it for yourself!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I shared a ""small"" bowl with my gf and we were both STUFFED after eating, the fruit was good and the yogurt was great as well!  We initially thought it was a bit pricey for 10 dollars a bowl but I would say you definitely get your money's worth with the quality and portion. I forgot the name of the bowl we tried but it had acai, strawberries, granola, and bananas, it was really good!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Toller lokaler Laden. Viele Einheimische holen sich ihre Bowl to Go. 
Ansonsten immer was los. Und Wartezeiten sind normal. Wir haben um 8 Uhr morgens etwa 20 Minuten gewartet. 
Platz zum gemütlichen Sitzen ist nicht zu empfehlen  da sehr voll und laut."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"We were in town for the weekend and wanted to get out town before the rest of the out of towners. I Was looking for a quick, healthier on the go breakfast. I decided to rely on my trusty friend Yelp and came across this place. While the bowls are great the wait time was not. Not sure if a 30 - 45 minute wait is the norm here but I wouldn't wait around that long again for an açaí bowl. I will definitely return if the wait time is not that long."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Review Update. I love the flavor of Backyard Bowls, but their consistency is officially horrible. Once again, I order a large bowl and it's no where near the top... Everyother day it's a different distance to the top. Today is the lowest in a while, I showed the cashier, he said ""Yup, that's a large"".. The young staff could careless, especially if it's busy. I feel robbed of my $10 once again. Usually the larges, the bananas are near the rim, where most of the time the lid presses down on the bananas. I give up... Time for a new spot."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place blew my mind. OH MY GOD IT""S GOOD!!!!

I don't think I'll have another smoothie outside my home made ones again.

Delicious thick smoothie topped with granola and then with all kinds of fresh fresh fresh fruit with honey drizzled on top. I don't know what else to tell you. Just Go!! NOW!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"My friend took me here for the first time today. It was super busy, which is expected for a delicious acai bowl place. We both ordered at the same exact time. My friends bowl came out in 30 minutes, it was filled to the brim. My bowl came out 15 minutes later, after they called about 5 other people (when my friend and I ordered at the same time) and my bowl was only half way full, only about a fourth with acai. Although it tasted delicious, not worth a 45 minute wait. And I was upset at the amount of acai I actually got. I am not one to write reviews but I felt like I had to say something about this place. They need to work on timing and consistency in their bowls."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Hands down one of my favorite places to grab quick food in Santa Barbara. Lots of fresh options and a slew of ways to customize your bowl/smoothie so that you get the supreme combination of nutrients and flavors you're looking for. 

Here's the catch: I consistently experience a little bit of spacy-ness from the staff, which usually translates to my order coming out wrong. This wouldn't be a big deal if I could eat granola or honey, but I can't.  So when they overlook my request to swap out granola for chopped almonds, or too quickly douse my bowl in honey before I can yell, ""NOOOOOOOO!"" I have to be THAT customer who is like, ""Uh, I'm afraid I can't eat this.""  If this had only happened once, I wouldn't be writing this review.  But it happens on a regular basis, so they get 3/5 stars.  I just hate wasting food. 

All that being said, some top performing menu items - provided you don't mind if they are made to spec or not - are the Popeye smoothie, the Diego bowl and the Island bowl. 

The Diego is a dense, satisfying bowl - particularly in the Large size. The peanut butter sits with you for long stretches of the day, and I usually forget to eat several meals after having one of these.  Not as sweet as the other bowls, but extremely filling. 

The Island is SWEET - even if you forego the honey. Something about the blueberry/banana/strawberry combination is enough to keep you shoveling bites of this bowl down before you can even think to breathe. Doesn't always keep you full for long stretches of time - likely due to the sugar crash you have an hour or so after eating it.  Regardless, if you're looking for a sweet smoothie-esque experience, this is your ticket. 

The Popeye smoothie is everything a green smoothie should be. Nutrient dense, flavorful, refreshing and this crazy vibrant green color - it ups your healthy-eater cred without you even really trying."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"After basking on beautiful stretches of sun-drenched Santa Barbara beaches, head to Backyard Bowls for a nutritious and refreshing acai bowl, breakfast bowl or smoothie. 

The nice lady at the counter recommended for me to try the Island Bowl or the Berry Bowl. I went with the latter and was instantly hooked. These belly-banishing wholesome bowls pack a one-two punch of flavor and nutritional benefits.The Berry Bowl ($6.95 small) comes with blended acai, fresh bananas, strawberries and apple juice, topped with granola, berries, Goji berries and honey. Such a tasty and incredibly refreshing breakfast, lunch or snack. 

Backyard Bowls offers a lot of great healthy options that pack a lot of nutritional punch, including steel-cut oatmeal and hot quinoa breakfast bowls, green veggie-packed bowls and tropical ginger and goji berry smoothies. You can chose from a number of enticing enhancements to add to your bowl or smoothie, like bee pollen, hemp protein, homemade cashew milk, ground flax seed, local jam and local crushed almonds. This is an eco-friendly business that promotes sustainable business practices and uses locally and sustainably procured ingredients. 

I see why this place has so many ardent fans...these filling bowls deliver on freshness, quality and taste. I will be coming back in next time I'm in Santa Barbara."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"These acai bowls were berry delicious! (I had to.)

I got the Island Bowl made with a base of acai, mango, banana, pineapple juice, and coconut milk. It was topped off banana slices, coconut shavings, strawberries, blueberries, granola, and honey. It was really refreshing! My friend got the Baobab Energy Bowl which was banana, mango, spinach, acai, and baobab (which we had to Google and it's a dried fruit with lots of multivitamins so yum!).

The regular size is big enough for a meal, but next time I'm balling out (or bowling out...) for a large and adding bee pollen, extra granola, peanut butter - the works!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,this was missing a lot. looks more like a small placed in a large container. the açaí is so so also. whole foods would have better.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This location is always bustlin'. The kids working are fast, efficient, and friendly. You'll be enjoying your made-to-order bowl or drink soon after ordering. 

Ingredients are fresh. No frozen, sugary nonsense found here. Low-fat and carbohydrate intensive, guess you can't have it all because of this was protein rich I would definitely be here more often.

I have yet to order something I am not happy with. Just depends in the mood.

A SB staple for locals & tourist. Yum."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Highly recommended if you're into Açaí bowls. The fruit was very fresh and delicious. The portions were huge and the granola was tasty. The one we ordered had coconut shavings on top. I don't like coconut, but I ate every bit of it."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Yum yum yum!!! Island bowl extra granola honey on top! Yes yes yes!!! Always stop here on our way to the central coast!

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious foods. Felt like a million bucks in smoothie currency. The fresh fruit, fresh blender, simple aesthetic - boom. You are in for the realist experience. Smoothie in a cup. Smoothie in a bowl OR get yourself a lil' juice in a bottle. They got snacks, too!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Seeing as that the only other place to get acai bowls is Hawaii or Jamba Juice, I love that I can get them here.  My favorite is the berry bowl because they throw goji berries in there.  The brasil bowl is my BF's favorite with extra honey.  They also have oatmeal that they cover in jam and almonds and bananas- YUM!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The meal was great, I would recommend this to anyone, the only reason why it only got four stars is because they could use some extra/mobile seating for when it gets busy. The location is a cool little spot and I went we the pb and j quinoa which was fantastic. It was easy and quick to order, service was good and I received my bowl pretty quick.  Again the only thing I think they need to do is make more space. Potentially remove some of the tables and go with more of a standing concept. Recommend you check it out if you're looking for something good and not fatty while doing the barbs/wine tasting."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"A lot of people love to hype this place up and maybe for some it is worth it. I came and got a regular backyard bowl and asked if there was a smaller size available and the staff were totally rude saying there was no way to do it with that smoothie and suggesting if I didn't like the size that I shouldn't consume their products. I was simply curious. I received my bowl after quite a long wait and saw multiple people get there bowls before me even though they had ordered after. The actual açaí bowl itself was sub par, nothing too exciting at all but wasn't bad either. I love a good açaí bowl but the service and rude individuals were really a let down and I was really hoping to like this place"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"First time trying an acai bowl and now I'm hooked.  Unfortunately, I'll probably never have one here in NYC as fresh and heaping with fruit and granola as they make at Backyard Bowls :("
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I stopped by here with a friend on our way back to San Luis Obispo after going home for the weekend to see what all the hype was about. The actual acai mixture was smoothie-like, nothing particularly amazing flavor wise, but it is extremely refreshing and smooth. The part of the bowl that was my personal favorite was the granola. Super crunchy and it didn't get soggy like normal granola does... I think it was the granola that made the bowl filling, as well. SOO YUMMY. The fresh fruit definitely adds another texture to the bowl and sweetness. Definitely worth the price when you're treating yourself... and you're not sacrificing major calories on this sweet thanggg. The location is a bit low key and doesn't have a big sign so don't miss it! Who wouldn't want an excuse to go to Santa Barbara?"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Grabbed an Island Bowl the first time I came here and it was delicious! I'm a fan of honey and coconut, and the fruit and yogurt were all very delicious and satisfying. It makes an excellent treat or breakfast. The staff were extremely friendly and efficient as well."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Came in on Sunday 10 mins before they closed just to hear that have to catch up on orders and can't take other orders. Too bad for them because they lost my business over Blenders and Grass.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard Bowls makes the best acai bowls I've ever tasted. I wouldn't even compare this to Jamba Juice; it's on a league of it's own. You can't go wrong with the standard Backyard Bowl, but my favorite is definitely the Cacao Almond Bowl, which is blended acai, banana, cacao powder, and cashew milk, topped with banana, blueberry, raw cocao nibs, almonds, granola and honey for $9.15 or $10.95 (large).  

Some other cool things about this place: they have a reward system with stamps. Eat your bowl there or return your to-go cup for a stamp toward one free bowl. They also serve Pitaya Bowls and what they call the ""Behemoth Bowl."" It's a giant acai bowl topped on a 12 oz bed of yogurt and it serves ""2-4 Normal Humans, or 1 Beast."" I would love to see it some day!"

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"So yeah, this place lives up to all the yelp hype. Super tasty and I was able to get my coffee fix next door while I waited for my bowl. Going back the next two days I'm in here town it's that good."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The Bowl is soooooooooo large that myfriend and I feel that a small bowl is enough for two girls and a kid ball would be enough if you're starving! Love the berry bowl!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"There are not enough good thinks to say about Backyard Bowls! Everything from their mission to the product is wonderful, and I'm officially addicted. The bowls are a little pricy, so I tried to make a replica at home, but nothing can compare. Each of the acai bowls are different, but I've never been disappointed. My favorites are the green bowl (only order if you like ginger) and island bowl. The hemp granola they use gives the bowl a great crunchy texture that is evenly distributed in your bowl, so it doesn't bunch up in one giant granola spoonful like others. Even though it is a bit pricy, they give you so much it can be two meals (or at least a meal and a snack)."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Healthy, hearty, and original.

I got the spartan muesli with a bed of yogurt, which cost $8.25.  I was shocked by the price, but I really enjoyed my breakfast!  I'd never had anything like that before, and it filled me up!  Plus, I don't mind paying that much for quality, fresh ingredients."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"""We ran out of bread"" they said, as we drove out of our way for the almond butter toast.  Disappointed.  But the Acai bowls are still bomb as hell, best Acai in Santa Barbara county, just be weary they write their own rules for what's in stock :P"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Friendly staff, clean prep area and dining space. 

The food seems high quality, I'm really glad to see they feature Strauss yogurt. 

I also love that they compost their scraps, which is great and unusual for a restaurant to do. So bonus points for that! 

But, if you're looking for something that is low in sugar or actually (science!) healthy, you won't find it here. I would like to see at least one or two options that have at least moderate sugar or low carb (ideally) but there's just....nothing offered here that fits the bill in that respect. 

I don't really see any of these bowls as being any healthier than downing a Blenders."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Yummy bowls filled with fresh ingredients. Came on a Monday morning and didn't have to wait in line at all. They have many different options depending on what you're in the mood for. I got the green bowl and my boyfriend got the Diego. They were super accommodating about changing and subbing certain ingredients in the order. 

The bowls tasted very fresh and delicious. Portions were huge and prices were fair based on what we got!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"very disappointed!!!!!! acai bowls are one of my favorite things to eat. i don't always have time to make them at home in the morning so i like or now used to like coming to backyard bowls because they use good products that taste good. but literally the last four times that ive gone specifically to the motor way location in the last month, every order ive made has been wrong. one time they didnt even put acai in the bowl i asked for, like how does that actually happen? the bowl was a light color clearly not purple so no acai was in there. whoever owns or manages this location needs to be way more aware of how the staff is working. clearly certain people are not paying attention to what is being asked to be added into the bowls. i always ask for toasted almonds and somehow they always forget. so why am i paying a dollar extra for extra toppings and supplements if im not even getting them??? i'm basically just giving away free money because i always get them to go and dont have the convenience to always go back. i went today and got two bowls and made sure when i told the cashier what i wanted that he got everything. but when i received my bowls totally wrong and not what i asked for at all and forgot like 3 extra things i had asked for in one bowl. then put peanutbutter in the bowl that wasnt supposed to have pb in it, put almonds in it but this time i went back and asked them to make it again which they did but did not put almonds in them the 2nd time. this location needs way better staff and people who actually pay attention to detail and care. probably not gonna go back to backyard bowls again, i wont waste my money. i will just make the time to now make my own at home. I can make way better acai bowls then I've been getting here!!!! That's one hunnid! Quality has gone down a lot!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Rockin' fruit and acai bowls. Very popular place always a line but worth it. Super fresh and tasty bowls. A model business.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Holy heavens this place is bamb! I'm not a huge breakfast person so I ordered the kids' size and it was very filling. 

I'd highly recommend this place for a change-of-pace healthy breakfast alternative."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"BABY COME BAAACK. After I hit the gym in the morning, all I want is an acai bowl from Backyard Bowls. (Which is difficult when you're in NYC.)

This is actually one of the best acai bowls you can ever get. The acai is always smooth and mixed in well with the other ingredients. I don't think I've ever gotten a bowl where the acai was too chunky or frozen, something that doesn't occur often. The Island Bowl is probably my favorite out of everything that I've tried -- it has the perfect amount of coconut.

It is pricey but for the quality of acai, it's worth it. 

PS: Please open a store in Manhattan."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The bowl itself was good, but for the price you pay it's not worth it. I'm not exaggerating when I say the actual açaí part of it was 15% of the bowl, and the rest was the toppings - so if that's what you're looking for it's great! If you're looking for a smoothie bowl it's not. It was very crowded when i went, but the workers were also pretty slow and I found a few rotten fruits in my bowl."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Good portions of food. Loudly environment. Tasty. I would recommend this to my friends.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love the fruit bowls at this place! I was a regular here when I was still living in Santa Barbara and now I seek it out whenever I visit. 

There are various fruit bowls, smoothies and other breakfast options like oatmeal or yogurt. Everything is made to order and even on busy weekends, the food comes out quickly. The small bowl is quite filling and the large could be shared between two people. There is a small seating area outside to eat there or you can get it to go. This is a wonderful, healthy treat that you could never feel guilty about!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I get the berry bowl here with a bed of yogurt and it is really delicious. Topped with berries and honey or agave and this is whole natural foods galor. Here's the downfall, I checked their nutrition info, and although I often over hear people raving about acai's protein content, an Acai berry bowl has ~3grams of protein and more than 60grams of carbs! SIXTY! That's enough carbs for a day in one meal! And mostly of it is coming from simple carbs from the Acai. The place is also loud, but the reason it gets 4 stars in because it's freaking delicious."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Absolutely try a bowl but don't miss out on the avocado toast. I feel like avocado toast is often overhyped but this avocado toast was a surprise hit with salty bits, pepperoncini, pickled onions, watermelon radish, and micro greens. Totally delicious!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is my favorite place to get açaí berry bowls! Best I've ever had. Recently, I ordered the Green bowl. Kind of tastes similar to Naked Juice's Green Machine. I liked that it tasted more ""green"" than overly sweet. Strawberries add a nice and sweet touch. This is very filling, even if you get the smallest size. About 25% of the bowl will have all the toppings and granola. At the end when you pick up your bowl, you get to choose however much honey you want.

I've ordered almond butter with every bowl I've gotten here (2 bowls total), and each time the almond butter is forgotten. I've had to walk all the way back to retrieve it. So, heads up, if you are ordering a side, I have a feeling that it will be forgotten so you should just make sure you remind them or else you will walk out without the side that you paid for. Still think this is a great establishment! Just want you to get what you paid for."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,I got a Island bowl and they made it bad. They had the nerve to charge me to remake another one
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Mmm....I really don't understand the popularity of this place. It's an acai smoothy with fresh fruit on top. It's ok, but didn't really blow me away. I guess if you're comparing it to Yogurtland or Pinkberry, it's much much healthier. Glad I tried it, but not sure if I'll be back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,I ordered a berry bowl and I can see my bowl is already half made waiting for the toppings. The employee is so busy talking and not trying to get my bowl for me fast. I waited for almost additional 10mins for her to cut half a banana and put some strawberry on top. The açaí also tasted a bit rotten like they used some really old rotten fruits in it. This is a huge disappointment because this is one of my favorite place in Santa Barbara and if they keep up this bad service and poor food quality I can see the place going down.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious San Diego bowl! Loved every drop of it with all the hemp protein, hemp seed, hemp milk and bee pollen! Shared a small with my boyfriend now leaving I wish I got the large but still just enough to leave me satisfied. I'll be back next time I'm cruzin highway 1."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Heaven in a bowl. Best acai bowl I've ever had.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love this place I think they have the best acai bowls! I'll always drive from Ventura up to Santa Barbara just for these :) their ingredients are always fresh and healthy. My favorite worker there is Lucas. He always goes above and beyond every time I come in and is always very pleasant. Love this place, give that man a raise"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Really great açaí here. Both the bowls and smoothies are good, definitely some of the best I have had. There was good fresh fruit on top, along with a granola that had a nice crunchy texture; each adding a lot to the flavor."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The acai bowls contain a thick smoothie base that are layered with granola, fruit, and other toppings such as honey or bee pollen. It's just the right combination to make up a perfect meal. I recently had the island bowl which was so good I couldn't stop eating it until it was gone. It left me very full and content :)

What I really like about Backyard Bowls is that many of their ingredients are 100% organic and are locally and sustainably produced. All of their to-go materials are made of renewable sources and are biodegradable or compostable. Couldn't ask for more."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love this after binging on too much junk food, on a hot day, or as a cure for a hangover.  Island Bowl is the best, and it's so good it's worth the $7-$8/bowl.  Filling, delicious, healthy, and there's no way I could get all those fresh ingredients and make it myself without paying a truckload more.  Love it!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Coming from San Diego, a place where you can find an açaí bowl every 100 yards, I have had my fair share of exposure to a variety of them.

Backyard bowls is definitely one of the better juice bars I've ever been to. I could tell his place was popular too from the line out the door at 12:30pm when I arrived.

The menu was just long enough, with a variety of pitaya & açaí bowl options - ranging from chocolate, peanut butter, fruity, tropical, protein powder, berry, and spinach infused options.  All of the bowls came with a variety of toppings consisting of fruits, superfoods, granola, honey, etc. There were 3 different sizes to choose from - small, medium, and large. The large is very big but it's a great deal for your money!

There was also a variety of smoothie options to choose from.  

The place was very busy when I showed up (about 10 people in front of me), but the wait for my bowl was very short!! The service was fast and the ordering process was easy. Would definitely return."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The peanut butter smoothie I got from this place is probably the best smoothie I've had in recent years. I needed a quick to go breakfast and would've ideally gotten an acai bowl but decided a smoothie would be easier consumed as I made a long drive up to the bay. 

My friends got the bowls and they were quite large but also rather pricey. However the bowls do have bougie ingredients like hemp milk,  cashew milk,  hemp seeds  bee pollen.. Etc. I'm sure they are quite delicious. 

Back to my milkshake- I've never had peanut butter and acai blended together and wow have I been missing out. It's a great combination and tastes great blended with some more fruits and hemp milk. I loved the thick creaminess and it filled me right up! I think these smoothies are a steal at ~$5 (for a large) and they're made with the same fancy ingredients that you find in their bowls as well. Definitely worth making a stop here!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"As a huge Acai addict, I couldn't pass up this place. They offer a great selection of bowls for different tastes at a reasonable price. The bowls are a good size and very filling. 5 stars!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is the SHIZ!  If your looking for an alternate breakfast, check it out!!!!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"All around fantastic and some of the beat smoothie bowls we have had! The strawberries were as sweet as candy and all the fruit tasted fresh. The wait was long due to the high demand, but that's how it goes sometimes."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,healthy and tasty! great way to start the morning
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Honestly love going to this place for acai bowls but this location was fairly busy and there was about a 25-30 mins wait to just get our bowls. Not sure if it was just location based or because it was a Saturday morning. But we still enjoyed our bowls despite the wait.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This was the best and biggest smoothie bowl I've ever had!! The staff was so nice and the food even better!! I didn't think large was gonna be THAT big but it was and it was awesome!! They really put a lot of toppings on it too and that is always nice lol! I also added extra almond butter! Go here!! You won't regret it
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Just another fruit bowl, right? WRONG. 
I've foraged the central and southern coast of California looking for another place that does ""fruit bowls"" justice.. Backyard Bowls, I am your loyal servant. Grab one to go and take it down to the beach or maybe to watch the sunset. It's paired perfectly with a nice conversation with friends or casual date."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"For a light breakfast  place, this place is great.  The oatmeal was sweetened with a locally made jam, which was excellent. They add toasted nuts which add a necessary crunch. If you looking for a light breakfast this is the place to go."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Amazing bowls and smoothies! Very quick and easy for students that have a time limit between classes or are always on the go. They are extremely delicious and filling but a little on the pricier side so just be fare warned about that. Would definitely recommend that Protein Bowl with Peanut Butter!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Obsessed!! I visit every time that I am in SB for work. Great healthy option. I get the kids size berry bowl and it is always AMAZING!! I beg of you to start opening locations in the LA area!! I could eat there everyday.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place has been open for a couple months now and although i've been to the other locations, i'm so happy this one is closer to me. It's already my favorite go to spot when I'm craving something healthy and refreshing! My usual order is the Berry Bowl which includes strawberries, dried goji berries, blueberries, bananas, granola, honey, and frozen Acaí blended with strawberries, banana, and apple juice. I usually order the small size which fills me up. Everything on the menu looks good and I can't wait to try something else like the Quinoa bowl with cashew milk and other good stuff in it."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This location is a hole in the wall place and it's wonderful.  Best acai bowls around!  I'm not really a fan of change, and when someone suggested we get the island bowl as opposed to the berry bowl that I usually get, I was a bit skeptical.  Especially since the berry bowl is delicious.  Well, I decided I should at least try it, and I'm glad I did.  It was amazing too!  This just further cemented the fact that this place makes some great healthy treats.  It's a smoothie, fruit and granola mixed in one huge bowl.  The small size is enough for two (though, once you taste it, you may not want to share), and the big is plenty.  I think when you order to-go, they tend to give you a little bit more, which is nice if you don't have time to hang around.  I'd recommend grabbing some Lily's Tacos down the street, then heading over here to get some healthy and even more delicious food afterward.  Double win."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Best smoothie and acai bowls in town! I eat here a few times a week, the quality of the fruit is always good and the staff is friendly as can be."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"If you want something fresh and amazing then definitely give this place a try. Every bowl I have had is amazing - one's I especially recommend include the island bowl, pitaya bowl, or Diego's power bowl. Only wanting a smoothie? Try the brekkie smoothie. 

Everything is yummy here and it has a healthy atmosphere that makes it good for your morning breakfast with friends. Anyone who hasn't tried acai or pitaya, make sure to try it here where the best is made!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Very delicious! The cocoa almond bowl is a perfect mix of chocolate/nutty flavor and sweetness from the acai and fruit.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great place! Love the breakfast bowl with steel cut oats. Returned and tried the ""Berry Bowl"" and liked it too, but personally prefer not so much smoothie-like base."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The acai in the bowls is healthy and tastes great with the fruit. I love that I can buzz in there and have access to all these great healthy ingredients. This place is a great idea and the world needs to just go there now!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Ahhhh I love this place!! If only there was a place in rowland heights or brea that would be awesome!! I was here visiting uc campuses at sb and was really craving an acai bowl place and yelp brought me here!! So yay.  I got there famous green Island bowl but substituted it with pitaya instead of acai.  The size I got was a large but it was definitely too big.  I asked for extra granola and honey because I like those alot and it doesn't cost extra as well.  The totally cost was 7 dollars which is cheaper than growl juice crawl in Orange.  The pitaya was a pretty vibrant pink color and had the right amount of sweetness. The bowl was put in a clear container.  The pitaya was good and the strawberries were alot. If I was in Santa Barbara again I would definitely come here.  The only proven is there isn't a bathroom and the kitchen area doesn't seem that clean.  But the food was really good.  I tried other bowls that my friends ordered and it the Coco almond wasn't that great.  I forgot what the other ones were but they were really good.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I love the concept. It's healthier and delicious without the risk of overloading your body with sugar. And they've got some interesting ingredients. I've never had some of these ingredients, like bee pollen? It was very tasty. 

My one complaint, however, is the pricing. I think it was like 8 dollars for a bowl? It's a much healthier option than yogurtland or pink berry or some ice cream. But it's ridiculous to eat healthier you have to spend more money."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard Bowls is always something I look forward to on a warm Summer morning right before a day at the beach. It's definitely more of a treat rather than a healthy meal, but very filling nonetheless and gives you energy for hours. They are very generous with their fresh fruit, peanut butter, coconut and granola toppings. Some toppings are limited to their seasonal availability. 

I've been coming here for years but generally as a special occasion treat as they are so pricey and full of sugar. I've had everything from the Acai Oatmeal to the Green Bowl. The Hercules is my go-to smoothie here, but again very sugary and not the healthiest protein shake. It's made with hemp milk which gives it the perfect texture and thickness but is often very heavy. My go-to is generally the Dragon Bowl because I love the pitaya kiwi mix. If you want the cheapest, least filling option I'd recommend the Berry Kid's Bowl. That is the only bowl they small in that size. 

This Backyard Bowls is located on lower State St next to Santa Barbara Roasting Company. It has its own 75 min free parking lot and street parking nearby, though i've never seen the lot full. You can park here and walk State St up and down after enjoying a bowl or even head down to the pier. It's a really nice central location, limited seating indoors and out, though. It's generally pretty busy so expect to wait a few minutes for your order to be done. They also have a drink fridge inside with kombuchas, waters and teas to go. Great morning spot to stop at before exploring the main touristy areas of SB."

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"EMPLOYEES ARE TURNING PEOPLE AWAY AND LOSING BUSINESS!! Came in @ 4:30pm on 4/23 to place an order after trying to place one online (said this location wasn't taking online orders) even tried to call and place an order on the phone but no one ever answered the 6 times I called through out the day. Came in to place 3 orders and was turned away being told they were temporarily closed because they were behind on orders. Funny it was 30 mins away from thier closed time but they stopped taking orders and were turning customers away. I'm not sure but if I was the manager I sure would like to know that my employees were turning orders away and losing business. This was my first bad interaction with this place, tried another location the next day with more horrible experiences."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Really good! I had the quinoa bowl with raisins and cashew milk with almond butter and it was VERY good. Tasted some of my friends all fruit bowls with acai and they were delicious too!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"BACKYARD BOWL IS MOTHER EFFING DELICIOSO. Im not much of a healthy person, nor do i like the taste of super healthy things most of the time but this place has changed that. I love them acai bowls here compared to any other place. Ive tried all the acai bowls and i have to say they all taste really bomb. The green bowl looks like dookie tho so hahaahahah dont get it if u dont like a slightly stronger taste of green veggies. my favorite is the island bowl and pitaya bowl! I like the berry bowl because of the goji berries but hey i love mangos and pitaya so island bowl and pitaya bowl are what i usually opt for. They use all these fresh ingredients so any of you vegans, vegetarians can come here and eat breakfast yassss. I like it for dessert tho cause shhh ima go to kfc across the street for dinner and then tell myself its ok by eating backyard bowls after. Also if you go to ucsb take those coupons they give you on campus cause they alwways got some coupons for backyard bowl hehe. It is kind of pricey around 7-8$ but so so worth."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This place is just a great tasting and healthy place. It's good if you just want a great bowl of acai with all sorts of fruits! It's definitely worth a try. Now budget wise it tends to be $8-$12 but it's definitely worth the taste.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This is heaven to me! I really love the fruit bowls so much. Finally got a chance to try the acai bowl in Downtown Santa Barbara. I tried the berry bowl , which is based on banana, strawberry, acai berry, and apple juice; then is topped with banana, strawberry, blueberry, gogiberry, granola, and honey. This absolutely addictive; freshness, sweetness, and crunchiness came all in one! I hope they will open in Bayarea."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Best bowls in Santa Barbara with an attractive staff. Granted, I don't know any other place that serves bowls in SB, but this one is the best. Yes, it's pricey and they can take longer than you think to make your order, but quality cost $$."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I have had the Berry Bowl and Island Bowl, both were delicious!! The small ( not the kids size) but the small is enough for my boyfriend and I to share. I
Like to get extra granola because I like more crunch. The bowls are perfect for a mid morning snack, so refreshing and filling!! The goji berries in the Berry Bowl give it a great chewy texture. I really like the coconut and banana topping on the Island Bowl. I can't wait to try more yummy, healthy things on the menu. I'm definitely a Backyard Bowl fan!!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My best friend and I did a day trip to Santa Barbara on a hot hot day and we were looking for something healthy and refreshing to cool down with. We made the trek from the seafront to BB and it took us about 15 minutes to walk there (since we didn't want to move our car). There is a parking lot in this plaza though but I am not sure if you have to pay or if you can validate.

It was my first time ever eating an acai bowl so I didn't have any expectation except I just know it was gonna taste healthy...

After ordering, we got a table in the patio outside of the store and drink some refreshing water to cool down. The waitress brought out the berry bowl and 2 spoons and we quickly dug in (after snapping a few pictures for yelp purposes).

OHHHH MANNN. If this is what healthy food taste like, I don't mind eating healthy alll dayyy everydayy! It was such a refreshing treat and every bite was yummy and flavorful! The large bowl was more than filling for two of us. We were struggling to finish the last bites of the berry bowl. It was the perfect combination of all the fruits and honey/juice in the bowl. I still crave it everytime it is hot but Santa Barbara is a 2 hour drive for me =["
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love smoothies and these smoothies (THESE SMOOTHIES YOU GUYS) were the best ones I've had yet. These smoothies are super thick so be prepared but they have the best flavor to them. I got the Blueberry Fields and my boyfriend got the Acai Smoothie. They also don't take forever for them to make the smoothies- they came out faster than any other smoothie place I've been to, and we were both shocked. Totally coming back anytime we pass through SB."

There's many options for parking 5/5
A lot of cute shops nearby"

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The bowls are huge be warned. I got a backyard bowl it was a more toppings to açaí ratio which didn't bother me because the toppings were good. it was a bit sweet with the honey if I'm going to really nit pick but I liked the bowl. I tried to finish but I only got 2/3 through it. My wife didn't like the Pb+j bowl she said she didn't like the porridge consistency but I liked it. I'm not sure what she was expecting. The kids didn't like seeing the bee pollen in the top of the açaí smoothie but I scooped it out and ate it and then they drank it. The smoothie was tasty too. All in all I thought the place was good even if my family isn't that into juice places.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This was my first time getting an acai bowl, and it sure was impressive and delicious.  I ordered a small cocoa almond bowl.  I was completely full and satisfied even though I couldn't finish it.  It's definitely different from eating a fast food sandwich for breakfast.  I got lots of energy and felt good.  Definitely want to try making this for breakfast on my own, because it is quite pricey.  $9.95 for the small but it's pretty big.   It's about the size of yogurtland's large cup, and they put lots and lots of fruits.    Maybe I'll get another bowl for the train ride back home."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Absolutely delicious bowls, our order got mixed up with another one but the other bowls were delicious! They even offered to give us what we ordered on the house after we accidentally dug into the wrong one. Will come back again!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,I've been going here for a while and always been happy with the service but not today. I ordered online and when showed up 20 min later they lost my order and waited an extra 10 min. Thank goodness I wasn't in a rush. When I got my order it wasn't even full only about 3/4 full. I've worked in the smoothie business and that's not acceptable. My order wasn't the only one like that.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The bowls are always super yummy, and I hate to leave a negative review, but I am not being dramatic when I say that EVERY time we've come in as a family, most every employee seems like they are high on something. They are in total slow motion, and not friendly or interactive at all with you as the customer. There seems to be quite the turnaround with new employees as well and yet the culture has yet to change. It wont stop us from coming, but we'd love to see the owners step in more and improve that side of things."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Great bowls just the wait omg took 30 minutes to make 3 bowls I'm sure they were busy yea but not to where they should have taken that long
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,perfect breakfast spot to get something good in your belly after a night of fun. the power bowl (mmm peanut butter) and (hot) quinoa bowls were both delicious. eco-friendly business also.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Fresh and fast. The bowls and smoothies are amazing. They cater to dietary needs and allergies. My favorite spot for a quick pick-me-up or recharge after a night out.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"*THIS IS THE BEST ACAI BOWL I'VE HAD OUTSIDE OF HAWAII *

they have three locations in the santa barbara area.

for those of you who have never tried an acai bowl, it is basically a smoothie in a bowl -- perfect for breakfast. =)

they have many options. we opted for a large berry bowl (two sizes)!!! 
it was delicious!! the berry bowl is an acai bowl topped with granola, sliced strawberries, sliced bananas, goji berries, flax seed, and honey. it was the correct consistency. 

the girls who work there are fun and friendly. they seem to enjoy their job singing happily to the songs that play.

if you want to order ahead of time, they have an app for that!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Delicious healthy berry/banana based breakfast. Feel good after eating this satisfying meal.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"First acai bowl, check! Had a positive experience here on a hot day in SB. The local sister recommended we get an acai bowl for the family to split after a morning stroll through town. I was like, ""Split? How can that even be possible for four people to split a BOWL?"" But oh, was I so happily mistaken. 

Their large bowl was probably a little smaller than a personal size watermelon. Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit but my sister was correct in that it did serve 4 hungry people satisfactorily. What was nice was that the price difference between the regular and the large was only about $2, so you really feel like you're getting your money's worth.

Will definitely be buying more acai bowls in the future. Thanks Backyard Bowls for a positive experience!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Backyard bowls is a gem of Santa Barbara. Every single time I am in one the staff treats me so well and is so nice a friendly. I've never had a bad meal here. I would suggest anyone visiting to go here for some great breakfast! Stay woke.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Had the power bowl, it was very good but couldn't taste the peanut butter.  For what they are serving up here, it's a little pricey.  I didn't see any prices on their website menu, so that was my first clue.  Not much bang for your buck here."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Hands down best smoothie I've had.

I got the Hercules no banana add strawberries.
Not to sweet just right."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Absolutely delicious, fresh ingredients, gluten free granola. I had the Diego bowl and it's super tasty, sizes are large packed with goodies, textures and flavors. Definitely stop by and grab one. Corner of State and Guitierrez!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I'm not gonna lie. I won't do it. This place would have gotten five stars, if there wasn't a hiccup with the order. The açaí was really really really good and the fruits were super super super fresh. It tasted exactly like it should. It made me fall in love with açaí bowls. During the order, I guess there was a little mixup so we had to wait a bit longer to get our food. However, I will absolutely return here next time I'm in Santa Barbara to get some breakfast or a snacccccc"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"When it comes to fruit, granola, and yogurt -- I am the queen. I loooooove the combo of all three mixed together in a bowl. And this is EXACTLY what Backyard Bowls offers, and some! Unlike Jamba Juice, Robeks, or Blenders, this place offers more than just smoothies.

The ""bowls"" are basically smoothies topped with fresh fruit, granola, and other amazing goodness (ie. honey). It's the perfect breakfast that leaves you feeling energized, light, and healthy!

I got the berry bowl and it was deliciousssss :) It was everything I needed that morning (ie. hangover).

The only downside is the price. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth trying at least once."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Was visiting thanksgiving week. Food and juice was fresh and delicious. It was a nice change from hotel breakfast. The service was very good. Wish I had a place like this near me.

But the Acai bowls are still bomb as hell, best Acai in Santa Barbara county, just be weary they write their own rules for what's in stock :P"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Really good place for acai! My boyfriend and I were looking for a good place for acai bowls on our trip to Santa Barbara and we loved this place. The mix was not too sweet and I enjoyed their toppings and the whole theme of the place was really cute. Definitely trying this place out again whenever we're craving acai
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Although they serve some of the freshest and delicious fruit bowls in town, the staff and management at times have  been unfriendly, rude, unattentive,  arrogant and unprofessional with some of  their once loyal customers that used to frequent their establishment every day. 

After experiencing (on more than one occasion) this above behavior we (my wife and I) have decided that it is not worth the 8-10 dollars to be treated with such rudeness.  

It is sad because we really enjoyed their bowls and have referred a lot of"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Wandered into this place after seeking a light brunch that wouldn't load us down for the long drive home. I had a small cocoa almond bowl, my fiancee had the small island bowl. They were both sizeable- we were both stuffed! Can't imagine getting a large unless I was doing some serious working out before or after. I would even go for a kid's size next time, or split a large between us. The cocoa almond bowl is heavily laden with blueberries, and I think adding the honey at the end is a little unnecessary. Anyways, a good choice and if I'm back in Santa Barbara I'll definitely check it out!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I really enjoyed my bowl, most acai places are all the same but this one stood out to me because of the granola. Granola is granola, but I liked theirs in particular compared to other places. Any place that offers cacao nibs, bee pollen & goji berries will always have a place in my heart. Service was nothing special, could of been a bit better but hey I'm there for the acai. I waited 10 -15 minutes for my bowl which is a bit long in my opinion but granted they were busy. Will be back whenever I go back to Santa Barbara again."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,One of the best açaí bowls I've had! Super kind people that work there as well! Highly recommend
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love love love their Acai bowls here! It was our first experience having one so yes I'm a noob but it was love at first bite. So fresh and clean tasting. I could have eaten 5 of them!! And I love how you can see them cutting all the fruit fresh and right in plain view. 

The wait was a little long but more than worth it for this beauty of a bowl. I would come back multiple times a week if this place was closer to home. 

Oh, and the kids portion seems like a regular sized portion to me. The small was huge and took me a while to finish which really allowed me to savor every bite. I'm sure that this is probably intended for meal replacement since it seems pretty health conscious but it tastes more like dessert. You won't be disappointed!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I'm a fan of Backyard Bowls! Personally, the small is too large for me, so I generally stick with the kids size Island Bowl. I don't really like most breakfast foods, but Backyard Bowls really works for me.

I make it a point to make weekend bike trips and stop by here on the way back home. Super refreshing way to end a bike ride, and not too heavy!

The cocoa almond bowl is also super good, but that island bowl.. man... Strawberry, banana, coconut shavings, and a nice drizzle of honey. They do charge you for extra honey, but sometimes, it's just so good you can't help it.

Price is.. not cheap, especially if you're a big eater, but the bowls are good enough that I keep coming back every 1-2 weeks. I don't think their margins are outlandish, since fruit on the whole is pretty expensive, but definitely too expensive (for me) to go all the time.

Seating is super limited, and taking it to-go is a good way to avoid standing and waiting for a table. Incredibly loud by the registers, but that's also part of the experience. Definitely a recommendation for a quick and fresh breakfast."

Very BAD costumer service!!!!...if you gonna have your bowl  or something you Have to wait until the employee eat and talk shit about their life style ...so you have to Wait however they want to server you..Fuck you All !!!!!!!!"

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Favorite breakfast place in SB... Go to the one next to Santa Barbara Roasting Co off of lower state street. Get your coffee from Roasting Co, and a bowl from backyard bowls, and you will have a great start to your day!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Bowls are awesome! But service is lacking. Staff aren't as clear when ordering. They fail to say hi or hello. And always forget to ask if the order is for here or togo. Can't complain about the product, but please work on service."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Best customer service ever by a guy named Zack!  He took my order today.  I've gone in BYB a million times, but I've never had such a good experience with ordering.  This kid looked me in the eye when I spoke.  He smiled the whole time and made me feel like I was the only one in the store.  He turned the screen around in order to come closer to me and make the ordering experience more friendly.  He repeated my order back to me to make sure he got it right.  Then...he told me how long my wait would be.  I continued watching him after I placed my order.  I observed him treating each and every customer exactly the same way.  He even came over to customers who had been waiting a while  to let them know their order was just about ready.  This kids is going to go far in life.  I don't usually write reviews, but I wanted to take the time to compliment Zack on Yelp in order for his supervisor to know what a great employee they have working for them.  I complimented him in person as well!  :)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Really good! I loved the Island Bowl, I think it was called.

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My wife and I spent our baby moon in Santa Barbara right before this COVID-19 shelter-in-place went statewide, and we visited backyard bowls every day after we discovered it.  They take awhile to put your bowl together, but it's every bit as good as the best bowls you can find in California :)

Hope this place is able to stick around, would love to come back once we can move about safely.

Stay healthy!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Spartan muesli - tastes like horchata, oatmeal, and fresh berries. Light, yet substantial!

Acaí green bowl - surprisingly amazing! Like a frozen green smoothie topped with fresh berries.

The place has plenty of parking and a beautiful view of the main drag and mountains!"

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The not so pleasant employees and terrible food make for a 2 star review. The only reason that I give 2 stars is because the strawberries were fresh and delicious. That's it! Too many employees behind the counter doing absolutely nothing but being negative and unhelpful. 
Over staffed with no customer service."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious!

We were looking for a healthy breakfast option during our visit and ended up coming for breakfast both days we were in SB and tried the island bowl and the backyard bowl and both were great.  The acai smoothie base was tasty and the fruit was fresh.  I especially loved the light (puffed?) granola .. I believe the small size runs around 500 cal and the large backyard bowl is close to 800 cal so it's definitely a large meal (if you can even finish it)!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I Absolutely recommend this place, if your looking for a healthy meal/snack. Everything is fresh and made to order. The service is friendly and you can tell the workers work hard making your meal."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I was visiting Santa Barbara with a group of friends and we decided to visit Backyard Bowls for lunch. The restaurant is small- there was a line out the door. The staff was friendly and efficient though and we got our food quickly. There was good ambiance while we waited -- the music was loud and fun. The food was delicious for a reasonable price. The acai was smooth and had a good consistency. Would come back! Only lost a star because there was not much seating and not great for groups.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Had the backyard bowl acai bowl and it was awesome! Loved the granola, bee pollen and honey topping.

Wish there was a place like this in LA. So many great options (smoothies, bowls, and even hot bowls with quinoa and oatmeal) and everything on the menu sounded delicious. Will definitely come back next time I'm in SB."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I had better acai bowls in LA. For the price, I will not come back. The bowl was aesthetically pleasing but for the taste, I would not come back. Overall, I had finished the bowl since I didn't want to waste food. Taste is alright, and price is alright."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"With the congested parking, healthy ingredients, chalkboards and girls in earth tones and unbrushed hair this is like the Trader Joe's of acai bowls.  No backyard, only a dark garage. Bonus: real bowls if you eat it here, ice cold acai, big portion,  a varied menu, and well-staffed, including the girl who looks like Jessa Duggar. (Her mission is to deliver you a bowl). Minus: no ginger shots, and the high noise level (thumping radio, whirring machine, self-important monologues about sustainable living)."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This was on my list of places to visit on our road trip last week. I'm so happy I stopped!! Deliciousness overload. The service was pretty fast, usually places like this take a while to make your ""bowl"", but they were pretty quick. It was everything I expected and more. The ambiance is fun inside too. Very California!! I can't wait to visit again."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"If someone came up to me and said ""Do you want a smoothie topped with granola and fruit for lunch?"" my man belly would cry in protest. It would be picturing ""fruit salad"" fruit (green melon, with a side of slimy melon) and expecting to be hungry after wards. Fortunately neither of these are the case. The granola makes for a filling meal (I usually feel too full after eating a large) and the fruit is oh so fresh and delicious without a melon in sight.."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Arrived to a mob of people with the line going out the door.  I was on yelp and saw they have call in orders so just called from out front and ordered the large Berry Bowl.  They quoted me 15 min which was cool cause needed a coffee at the Roastery next door. 

My bowl was ready to-go cup at $9.95 and the cashier offered me honey on it.  I liked the way it looked with all the fruit on top and saw that it looked like a berry smoothie underneath.  

I started mixing all of it together and it was very refreshing on a warm day.  I really wasn't expecting such a smoothie drink and kind of wanted more fruit.  As I drove back to my hotel I started feeling hungry so stopped and got a deli sandwich.  

I still haven't eaten my sandwich an hour later, but will soon. I think this more of a breakfast item and would like to try some more!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,super bomb açaí bowl spot in downtown sb!! loved the cocoa almond bowl and the small size was the perfect snack to share between the two of us:)

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Excellent place for breakfast with tons of healthy options. 

Dragon Bowl and Avocado Toast."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"A friend took me to Backyard Bowls after a morning run. Seriously--does it get much better than a beach run and a healthy breakfast? I think not.

I really enjoyed Dan's bowl which was incredibly filling and tasty. I'm glad they cover the top of the bowl in fresh fruit and granola so that it covers the nasty looking bottom portion which is green from the spinach. 

The bowl cost about $10 which is more than I'd like to spend at an order-at-the-counter breakfast place. But, on the other hand, good healthy food costs more than junk. Next time I'm in Santa Barbara, I'll be back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Amazing healthy snack! Had one of their peanut butter bowls and it was tasty and delicious. Get the honey on top!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My first time trying a bowl -- umm anywhere! And I have to say, I like it!

Ordered the berry bowl with acai...Oh, for anyone out there like me who was pronouncing it ""ah-kheye"" it's actually pronounced ""ah-sah-eeh."" LOL, I did not know that :P

The small is actually very big - definitely can share it between two people. There was an acai blend on the bottom with layers of granola, bananas, and assorted berries (strawberries, blueberries, and gogi berries). It takes awhile for them to make each order, but that's bc everything is being cut and blended fresh and on the spot. 

Final thought? Yummy."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard bowls might be named that because a large is basically the size of a backyard. It's huge, healthy, and reasonably priced so there's not much more you can ask for!

I've tried the greens bowl and the Diego ""protein bowl."" I got large both times and almost regretted it with the Diego. With the greens I'm pretty sure I had a pound of strawberries stop my bowl. The fruit was fresh, the acai was well blended, and everything tasted refreshing and pretty good. Although I could see the kale I didn't really taste it. The protein bowl was a bit heavier- I liked the texture of the hemp crunch but found it to be lacking peanut butter flavor. I wish that they had extra honey since I like adding 1/4 a bottle to my bowls."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Yummiest acai bowls in the tri county area! Beats acai bowls in LA, in my opinion too. Huge quantities, which is reflected in the price as well. I always get the regular berry bowl (kids size fills me up), but would recommend getting the small size if you're going for a meal. Diego bowl is good too because it comes with peanut butter, but the taste seems to get boring after halfway through"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Super delicious! Even my boyfriend who tends to crinkle his nose at unfamiliar or ""healthy"" foods was sold. Their bowls are filling and the options are plenty! So don't be intimidated by prices. Smoothies are a standard $5 and the bowls range from $8-10. Well worth it for an energizing breakfast! I was pleased to learn that they are super flexible with swapping out ingredients and toppings. I will be back here next time I visit town."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Showed up with my family 10 mins prior to closing time and was met with a ""Sorry, we're closed"" sign. When I walked in to ask why the store was closed before business hours, I was told by one of the associates that they had other orders to fill and usually closed early to do so. I find this to be unacceptable and it was a negative way to end my family's day trip to Santa Barbara. I would really appreciate an explanation! As would the others that were hoping to get a cool smoothie on this hot day."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Fun fact: 
The acai they use is frozen. Why? Because acai comes from Brazil and contains almost no natural sugar aka it can't be shipped fresh to the USA because it'll never make it. So, it's frozen. Second, it's not frozen yogurt or ice cream. If you are looking for that, there's a Yogurtland nearby.

Backyard Bowls is a green business and they try to only use local and organic products (and I believe they're all organic now), which explains why their bowls/smoothies might seem overpriced.

Run down:
Berry Bowl - if you're looking for something fruity, this is it. It has apple juice in it, blended with bananas and strawberries, topped with bananas, strawberries, blueberries and goji berries. Though, the name is a little deceiving since there aren't that many berries on it.

Island Bowl (favorite) - tropical; It's made with coconut milk and pineapple juice, blended with bananas and mango, topped with bananas, strawberries, blueberries and coconut shavings. Sometimes, I replace the banana in the blend with pineapple instead... whole new world. 

Diego Bowl - peanut butter fanatics, this is your thing. It's made with hemp milk, blended with bananas and strawberries. It also has hemp protein in it and it's topped with bananas and hemp seeds. Super filling, but personally, I think it tastes better with strawberries on top.

Green Bowl (another favorite) - it has apple juice, blended with bananas, broccoli, spinach, a squeeze of lime and a little ginger. The lime and ginger give the bowl a bit of a twist, so the best way to describe how it tastes is comparing it to an Odwalla or Naked juice. I believe they've started using kale instead of broccoli now, though. It still tastes good, but depending on how much kale they put in, it can sometimes taste more bitter.

Backyard Bowl - just like the berry bowl, but it's made with hemp milk and also has bee pollen on top, and it only comes as a large.

Pitaya Bowl - just like the island, only the acai is replaced with pitaya, which is dragonfruit from Nicaragua. It's low in sugar and high in fiber. It's good, but I still prefer acai. Though, it is a really cool neon pink color.

Cocoa Almond - their way of bringing chocolate into the acai scene. It's made with cashew milk and blended with bananas and cocoa powder, and topped with bananas, blueberries and cacao nibs.

If you want to cut down on some calories, you can sub almonds for granola (every bowl comes with granola), omit the honey, and/or sub acai for pure acai, which is unsweetened.

The smoothies are pretty good, but kind of repetitive. Each of their smoothies are similar to their bowls:
Acai = Berry Bowl
Tropical Ginger = Island Bowl
Peanut butter = Diego Bowl
Popeye = Green Bowl
Pitaya = Pitaya Bowl
Cocoa Acai = Cocoa Almond Bowl
Brekkie = reduced fat milk, yogurt, blended with bananas, strawberries and granola

The breakfast bowls are tasty and very filling. They're all made with steamed cashew milk and either oatmeal or quinoa. I'm just not a huge fan of those two things in general. BUT, if I had to choose, the Backyard Quinoa or Mama's Oatmeal is good.

This is the original location and definitely the busiest. The service here can be great, but when it gets packed/hectic, their customer service can go downhill. If you're going on a nice warm and sunny day or the weekend, expect to wait anywhere from 10-30 mins (depending on which location you go to). Sound ridiculous, but the workers do only have so many blenders to make bowls."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Grooviness earns 3 stars. I enjoyed my original small bowl, but for $6? Too expensive. And the granola is too puffy fakish."

The place is very clean and most of the staff was friendly. I really love their bowls and avocado toast. This is a must-have when visiting SB! Thank you backyard bowls :)
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Backyard slow is more like it. It takes 15 minutes every time even for small things like smoothies when there's one other person in front of me waiting for their order and there's 3 people working. Don't get me wrong this place has great acai bowls and smoothies and even a few minutes to wait is fine but you can't be taking on average 15 minutes per order every time. 

Suggestion: Prioritize and organize"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Taste amazing ( almost as good as the ones I make at home ) service was great and they're generous in how much they serve you. Awesome place.

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My very first taste of acai bowls and I'm hooooooked!!

After a long (and torturous lol) hike up to Inspiration Point, my friends and I came down here for refreshment and to re-energize ourselves. It was ridiculously hot and we were craving smoothies, and luckily this joint popped up in our search!

The acai bowl REALLY hits the spot! It's filling, healthy, and is a great morning/brunch meal after a good workout. I got a small size of the berry bowl (blended acai, bananas, strawberries, and apple juice mixed with granola and topped with strawberries, blueberries, goji berries, and honey). Also my first time having goji berries (never heard of these). But omg the bowl was seriously sooooo good and refreshing!! Best thing about it was that it was so satisfying and I also don't feel disgustingly full afterwards. 

Hopefully they'll expand to the LA/OC area in the future, because it would be a HIT and I want me s'more acai bowls hehe. I HIGHLY recommend coming here for a meal after a good workout and also a pit stop if you're visiting SB! Definitely go for one of their acai bowl options since not many places make yummy acai bowls (according to a friend :) )."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"One of the best Acai bowls I've ever had. Hands down. Period. Put a stamp on it and send it to mom. It's over with. Done.

If anything this place is becoming a victim of it's own success, as it's sometimes hard to get in there now. Long lines, and they run out of seating because it's so popular. I guess there are worse things to complain about right?

If you're looking for an Acai bowl, go here. Don't mess with other places, as you'll just end up here in the end. Seriously."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I used to eat at Backyard Bowls a lot in high school and city college. My order has always been the pitaya bowl. It's been years since I've been back and I was anxious to try it again and see if my favorite bowl lived up to it's expectations *drumroll* it did!

I had about thirty minutes to spare before I had to catch a train and this place is open early and a short walk from the train station. The line was short, but the wait for my bowl was really long. They seemed pretty short staffed. It was almost time for me to leave before I missed my train, so I let one of the employees know this and she quickly expedited my order and transferred it into a to go box. The employee was so sweet and apologized for not making it pretty. It was totally ok and tasted amazing anyways! Another woman was also in a similar scenario as me and I believe they did the same for her because I saw her on the train later on with a to go bowl. I love the service here and the bowls are hard to beat."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"First time at Backyard Bowls and I have to say, I don't feel bad after having a meal here because of the fresh fruits and healthy toppings. 

My friend Kristof and I met up here for lunch and this place is conveniently located near State St and in front of a parking lot.

The place looks kinda small but I guess it looks like that because it's full of hungry customers lol

The employees are really chill and knowledgeable on their bowls and ingredients. One of them accommodated to my wisdom tooth removal needs and made helpful suggestions on what bowl I should order (between berry and island).

I ordered a small island bowl and wow, it's huge like the largest bowl at Yogurtland filled up! Everything in it tasted amazing and killed most of it without much heavy chewing and got my share of proteins & vitamins :)

I highly recommend this place and will def return for another fruitful visit :)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,One of the best açaí bowls I have ever had. I got the power bowl with peanut butter on top. Would highly recommend and I am definitely coming back. Friendly staff and awesome decor.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Horrible service and poor staff structure. I waited 20 min. For my bowl... ordered it for here... they put it in a to go package and said we stop serving for here at 4:17 which is 40 min prior to closing time. Max did not even bother to tell me the order change and my to go bowl was sitting on the counter the whole time and no one even notified me that it was done. For all I know I could've been waiting until 5 and no one would've told me about my order.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"aesthetics: 3.5/5
food: 3/5
service: 3.5/5

this place is aight, nothing super special about it!! i usually make my own acai bowls at home for a fraction of backyard bowl's cost so i feel like this place charges a lot for their food. minus that, backyard bowls is a chill spot to meet up with friends over healthy dessert."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Very tasty.  I got the oatmeal and it was really filling.  My boyfriend got the berry bowl and it was also very filling and great tasting.  Would definitely recommend this to other people.  The only thing is the long line, but that is most likely because of COVID and not having as much staff."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Hard to place Backyard Bowls between a 3 and 4 star review. I REALLY like their smoothie bowls, and overall l enjoy frequenting this location when I'm in the area. Their fruit is fresh, and their granola is as well; they also have an excellent variety of smoothie bowls and smoothies. I wouldn't necessarily call them true açaí bowls, as the base is a blend of fruits, fruit juice, and açaí, but regardless they are filling and rejuvenating yum yum meals. Some of the bases for the bowls are quite tasty, with strong tartness and sweetness; others are a bit more subtle and mild. 

But, the wait for your bowl is INSANE. We are talking 30-40 minutes from ordering to finally getting your bowl. And this is during a quiet hour in the morning. I have never waited that long at any other smoothie bowl/açaí bowl/Jamba Juice-like place. Further, there were multiple other individuals waiting who were waiting just as long, if not longer for their bowls. Unfortunately, the last time we were here (at this location specifically), the wait was also strangely long. I know they are making my bowl from scratch, but it's also starting to feel like they are going out and picking the fruit that day as well. Meanwhile, a bunch of people are picking up their online orders with seemingly no wait at all. We couldn't figure out what the issue is, because there were a gazillion people working in the back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"If your looking for an easy, fruity, and delicious açaí bowl, I recommend this place. It had a lot of different pre made bowls to choose from, or you can make your own. All the ingredients in the bowl are fresh and tasty, including the açaí itself."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Beautiful bowls with fresh ingredients. Seating available during pandemic outdoors. I ordered small  bowls but got large which I ate, so just make sure the size is what you want. A large bowl is largggggeeeee."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,So good! Favorite bowl in Santa Barbara. I got the berry bowl and added peanut butter. So good!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"A little pricy, but you get a huge bowl at the price. I got the island bowl (acai, granola, bananas, strawberries, w/ coconut and honey on top) and it was AMAZING. One of the best things I've ever tasted."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I waited 43 minutes for a f***in acai bowl. Forty-tgree f***in minutes. That's almost an hour, for an acai bowl."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"One of the best Acai bowls I have ever had. For a non-millennial I have had my fair share too!!! It was fresh and delicious dressed with tasty granola and fruits. It did take a while but they were very busy!

My husbands avacado toast left a lot to be desired. With little to no avacado and they left the pickled veggies on when specifically we said none. Its ok we took it off but he HATES anything pickled and ruined his experience. 

BUT with that said the acai bowls are perfection!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The bowls are solid but don't buy one from here unless you want to wait 40 minutes for your bowl. I've been at least 5 times and every single time, it's a 30-40 minute wait."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Dear girl with the green T-shirt with ""volunteer"" on the back and guy in a gray T-shirt, it was hilarious to see you awkwardly flirt (the kissy faces at each other were so great), but less hilarious that our smoothie bowls took long because y'all were taking 2 whole minutes to cut a single strawberry. Good bowls though."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"It was great to find this place next to roasting company, they serve a generous Acai Ball, perfectly made avocado toast with reddish and pickles on the top, 

The crew is super nice and you can grab best coffee in town near by!

Worth coming!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Mmm, delicious. We got the warrior bowl and it wasn't too sweet. I'm not a fan of overly sweet breakfasts, but this just hit the spot. I especially loved the nuts and the almond butter on top. So smooth, so silky, so delicious!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I've been wanting to try this place for years!  I'm a huge fan of acai bowls and I was so excited to finally try it. I got the warrior bowl and they really give you a heaping portion. I couldn't even finish the whole thing! You're definitely getting a bang for your buck here. I definitely want to come back and try their other acai bowls!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The Island bowl with bee pollen is my favorite. I have had Acai bowls in many places and the best is Backyard Bowls in Santa Barbara. Tart with bananas and strawberries and crunchy bites from the granola and honey drizzled all over the top. Outstanding.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is amazing! Every time I go I am one hundred percent satisfied with what I order even though it is admittedly on the expensive side.

Great for a quick breakfast or lunch, always fresh and great service!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is worth the wait. And depending on when you come by, you might find the line to order out the door. Backyard Bowls is sandwiched between a coffee place and a chocolate store. For anyone obsessed with acai, this place is for you. You can get your acai in a bowl piled with fruit or blending in a smoothie. Because I needed to drive down to San Diego, I opted for the acai smoothie. It was great! For those looking to enjoy their food at Backyard Bowls there is seating on the patio for groups both large and small and some seating inside at the counter. Staff is really friendly, and willing to give you recommendations on what to order."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I love this place!!! Great bowls and smoothies and a wonderful staff! Everyone is so kind and welcoming and happy to help.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The best in town! Don't go anywhere else for an Acia bowl! The smoothies are delicious and so is the oatmeal. Backyard Bowls is the best! Order online and pick up is the easiest.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love Backyard bowl. The location is perfect, because the whole block serves a foodie many delights. On this block you can get your health kick on by stopping here to get a smoothie, or a acai bowl. Next door is one of the best coffee shops. Across the street is the best taco shops around. Check it out and you'll fall in love with Santa Barbara back yard bowl too."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I am a slow convert to Backyard Bowls but now I am hooked. I like to grab the ""berry bowl"" on my way to work on Fridays. It has acai, banana, granola, berries and shredded coconut on top.  If you are looking for a light and sweet breakfast on the go, this is your place! The one in Santa Babara is located next to a coffee shop so you can get an iced coffee to go with it."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My husband and I enjoyed our acia bowls very much. The service was great. Though the parking was tight and seating was limited, it was worth it."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Yeah, so Backyard Bowls needs to open a Brooklyn location STAT. I might go broke, but at least I'll be happy and nourished. Call me dramatic, but this stuff is life-changing.

So... they start with a creamy, delicious smoothie base of your choice. Then they top it with granola, fresh fruit (sliced in front of you!), honey and whatever else you want. In my case, cacao nibs, goji berries and hemp seeds. The result is crunchy, creamy, refreshing and absolutely addictive. Something about the variety of textures and flavors is just out of this world. I want this stuff for breakfast. And lunch. And as a snack in between.

The staff is really nice and friendly. Oh, and you can buy little straws filled with local honey at checkout.  I got really excited over them and a teenage girl next to me remarked ""oh. you've never had a honey stick? that's, like,  really depressing"".  Indeed, my friend. Indeed.

NYC needs you, Backyard Bowls. PLEASE. Someone?"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"So good! I've been coming here for years and its definitely a treat! Though most days i don't crave it, but when i do it hits the spot. I got the Island bowl its probably my fave, though they put way too much honey on it! Parking is packed during lunchtime hours as well as inside because its a pretty small shop."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"What is better than fresh fruit? The answer, an açaí bowl jam packed with a medley of fresh fruits and topped off with a soirée of toppings. 

Even better is the availability of customization to allow you to create the perfect arrangement of your choosing. Personally, I love adding an extra bed of yogurt for the fruit to cozy up on adding an enjoyable balance of sweetness and tart with every scoop. 

A must try on a hot day or as a healthy meal alternative."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I'm relatively new to açaí bowls, so I walked into Backyard Bowls a bit overwhelmed... so many options! I opted for a very traditional bowl with açaí base, granola, blueberries, strawberries, banana, honey, and chia seeds. I got exactly what I expected and was pleased with the size of it as well. The other bowl we ordered was a pity bowl with bee pollen. That one was a bit funky. Not bad, but definitely more of an acquired taste. He made it through it, but I highly doubt he would order it again. 

Easily, anyone could find something here that suited their taste buds. If anything, there are just too many unique and special ingredients that a newb like me wouldn't know what to do. If you're like me, stick to the traditional, OG açaí. It's well worth it. Pricing was what you'd expect for the prime location in Santa Barbara. Also next to a delicious coffee shop to complete a quaint breakfast morning."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"If your looking for a healthy breakfast acai bowl or smoothie you can't go wrong here. 

My usual goto bowl is the Brasil bowl- trust me the small bowl is plenty big enough. Give this place a try if you haven't yet!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is a breath of fresh air. I crave it all the time, I'm traveling and wish they had a backyard bowls everywhere! I also love how Affordable it is, definitely keeps me coming back."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The food is SO great here - I absolutely love the bowls. All the ingredients are fresh and fast. However it sounds like you are entering a construction zone when you are here. The blenders are so loud. Would recommend earplugs or a really cool hat. Or a friend who will cover your ears for you while saying ""earmuffs""

Pro tip: kids island bowl is cheap and definitely enough food to satisfy an adult."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Best Acai place in SB county! 
I love calling in and then being able to swipe my card and then pick up. Super convenient and super yummy!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I've tried the BYB location on State Street, but since this location was closer to school, thought I'd drop by. A lot smaller, but has a room full of seats to devour a bowl like I did.

I'm a huge fan of nuts, açaí, chocolate, & peanut butter so I went for the Cocoa Almond bowl.

blended: açaí, banana, cacao powder, cashew milk
toppings: granola, almonds, banana, blueberries, raw cacao nuts, & honey

Verdict: You can taste the quality! I asked for a small cause the large looked way too big, but the kids size would've been better. They said they only do the kid's size for the berry bowl. Still finished it! For a hot summer, it's a good little cool down. Docked only a star off because I came during a busy afternoon. I would rank this 5 stars compared to the açaí bowls I've tried out in Orange County!

Thanks for the energy boost!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Parking is free in the lot as long as you stay under 75 minutes! I had one of their green juices which tasted fresh but I definitely tasted whatever sweetener they used. I'd prefer it just bitter and unsweetened or use something that blends in better with the overall taste.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Good food with a side of micro aggression. Expect loud noise throughout your whole visit. This company doesn't not care about they're employees as much as they say they do. Give them some ear protection.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"We went camping in the Santa Barbara mountains and had planned on going kayaking so I looked up some spots to get us pumped up for our paddle that day. We got lost finding it for a bit but when you see the Panda Express it is right next door!

They had a lot of great options and the portions were huge!  We had the Island Bowl which has Acai, Banana, Mango, Pineapple Juice, Coconut Milk topped with, banana, strawberry, blueberry, coconut shavings, granola and honey.

It was really flavorful and I was really sad when it was done lol. Can't wait to come back!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Super Disappointed ordered a Gainz bowl to go.  By the time I got in the car and pulled away and then tried it, it was literally 1/4 full of the acai and the rest was granola.   It was about 1 inch of acai!   Bogus!  And it didn't even taste good, mostly peanut butter- Very bummed- $9 for granola?"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,Giant chunks of açaí throughout that missed the blades of the blender. Vibe was less than desirable. The wait was long. Disappointed to say the least. All 3 of us threw away more than half of the bowls.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great options for açaí and smoothie bowls. You're able to make any of the smoothies into the base of a bowl which I loved because almost all the bowls were açaí based. They have plenty of topping options and you can add extra items if you'd like. They also are some of the largest bowls I've ever seen, the large in insane, definitely couldn't finish a whole one! I got the rose glow smoothie and it had a pretty strong banana taste which I don't like so would probably try another flavor next time, but love the toppings it came with."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I got a regular dragon bowl from here and it was good pretty filling but there wasn't much taste (it was lowkey bland). The wait was kinda long too but it makes sense because it was a weekend and a hot day. They gave my friends bowl to someone else so we had to wait longer which was a little annoying especially given the pandemic. We were probably there for at least 30 mins, just waiting. Would recommend ordering before heading there for sure!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Heard so much about this place so I had to check it out during my trip to SB! First of all the bowls are delicious but they are SO DAMN LARGE!!!! The only size option for most of the bowls are ""regular"" which is more like a large and it runs you $10 so I would definitely recommend sharing a bowl with a friend. I came here for breakfast and I felt defeated by my bowl. It was like a pound of acai and it's a huge breakfast for one person. So with that I wish they offered a smaller size but the bowls were packed with a whole lot of healthy goodness so I definitely think it's worth the price.

I tried the pitaya smoothie ($6) on the first day and it was a nice refreshing treat. I thought it was a tiny bit too sweet at first but it actually wasn't too bad and I was able to finish the entire thing without feeling sugar overload. 

The cocoa almond acai bowl ($10) was monstrous. It might seem overpriced but it really comes with so much stuff. It was filled with a cocoa acai base with cashew milk which is tastes like chocolate fro-yo topped with hemp granola, bananas, blueberries, and cocoa nibs. Super delicious and the fruit was really fresh. 

This location was super busy but we got our food in no time. I'd say it's pretty efficient cause customer service wasn't sacrificed either. Highly recommend!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I love that you can customize your acai bowls here! I usually substitute crushed almonds for the granola and add frozen blueberries to the blend. They make delicious cashew and hemp milks in-house, which taste amazing in their acai bowls. Gotta add hemp seeds on top!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,This is the best place to get Açaí bowls. I was not a fan of them for such a long time because I had previously tried Ubatuba and was really dissatisfied and disappointed. This place changed my mind COMPLETELY. I drive an hour just to get here because I love it so much. 12/10 just go... right now. GO!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,I love this place but honestly I am only leaving this review to encourage them to get different straws. The drinks are not able to be consumed through the paper straws and every time they disintegrate far before the smoothie is finished.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Awesome smoothie bowls! We arrived right as they opened at 8AM, and soon after, there was a line. Perfect way to start the morning without being weighed down. We were happy we started our day filled with biking this way. 

Almost all the options are nondairy! My husband was so full, he couldn't eat the whole bowl-- which never happens"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"The bowls are good but forget trying to go there if you are in any sort of hurry.  I tried to call my order in over the phone several times only to have someone answer and immediately hang up.  After that the line went busy until I got there where I assume they just left the phone off the hook because they had a line.  I left without ordering when the girl in front of me was told there would be a 25 minute wait for her order.  Not great customer service, guys..  waste of a lunch break."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Pros: delicious, healthy, friendly staff, i can't get enough of this place. the smoothies are fresh and healthy (no additives, gross sugary stuff, etc. like you might find at jamba or blenders) & the island bowl and the diego bowl are fantastic. I love to switch the granola for almonds. the agave or honey they top everything with makes it fabulous. And all of the ingredients are organic. And if it's too cold for an acai bowl the hot quinoa or oatmeal bowl with fresh berries, honey, and almonds is just as good.

Cons: I wish they listed the calories somewhere...I checked a regular (unaltered) island bowl on MyFitnessPal is over 750+ calories! I know the contents is all healthy, but still I'm no longer eating one every morning. 

Overall: I crave these all the time. the best."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"YUM!! We ordered the acai Berry Bowl and the Island Bowl. Both were out of this world. I highly recommend this place. Super healthy, super delicious. Backyard Bowls, come to San Francisco!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Love their bowls and the atmosphere of this place! Perfect if you want to bring your bowl to the beach and soak in the sun or go the opposite way for a snack while shopping on state! They are packed with all the goodies, my personal go to right now is the Island bowl! I also usually get it in a kids because it's filling pretty filling for me! Also pro tip is if you want to share with someone, get a large and just ask them to split it for you!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard Bowls serves a big breakfast without all of the greasiness and/or animal flesh that typically accompanies the words ""big breakfast."" Each bowl is filled with healthy goodness to get your day started off right. Fresh fruit, granola, honey, and more are prevalent here, so it's a good way to feel less guilty about gorging yourself with tacos, burritos, and beers during the rest of your weekend getaway in Santa Barbara (guilty as charged).

I loved the Mama's Oatmeal bowl (steel cut oats, cashew milk, almonds, bananas, and jam). It was like a hearty breakfast stew and it filled me right up. Other orders that my family enjoyed: the Backyard Quinoa (cashew milk, raisins, walnuts, strawberry, blueberry, and agave) and the Berry Bowl (blended acai, banana, strawberries, and apple juice, topped with banana, strawberry, blueberry, goji berry, granola, and honey). 

The restaurant is noisy with the whirring of blenders and the steady stream of customers, but it's not unbearable. It's great that the Santa Barbara Roasting Company is next door. Order your bowl, go grab a coffee from RoCo, then arrive back just in time to enjoy your breakfast bowl."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I ordered the açaí smoothie yesterday and it was really good, just shy of amazing.  It was so fresh and tasty that I am actually craving one this morning. Sadly I'm back home in San Diego. 

Warning: For some people the Backyard Bowls açaí smoothie may be addictive."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Eh, ""healthy."" My eye. Overused word if you ask me. I get the concept. I gave it a try, it was good. However, I will not be coming here ever again. Why? 'cause I own a blender. It's all frozen fruit blended with milk or juice. I can buy frozen berries at any grocery store. I've lived perfectly fine without a acai berry product. Yes, product. They make those smoothies with frozen product, not fresh. It may have started out fresh, at one point, that was back before it was processed into frozen mush."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Super refreshing special popeye smoothy great energy boost the afternoon before a bike ride. Use their ordering app to avoid a wait.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Expected way more from this place. The seating isn't great and the food isn't super healthy unlike my expectations.. 
Super beautifully served though and quite fast. Big portions too"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Probably some of the best acai bowls that I've had! Went with a friend after working out next door and it was poppin' on a Saturday morning!

The inside is kind of small with not a lot of seating for the amount of people that were there. Besides that, the bowls here are MASSIVE and I wouldn't recommend getting the large like I did unless you are absolutely ravenous. Still, after not eating and working out I was barely able to finish the large bowl. However, you definitely get your bang for your buck!

Acai bowls here are fresh, delicious, and amazing! I went back here twice during my trip to Santa Barbara and would recommend it to anyone!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"My husband and I were visiting from Seattle. We are big fans of açaí bowls and have tried countless bowls across multiple states. While the bowl itself was okay (I've had much fresher and flavorful bowls elsewhere), the service was terrible. The wait was 40 minutes and two of our four bowls were the wrong size. However, it was the lack of care and attention to my food allergies which precipitated this review. I cannot eat gluten and paid for the gluten-free granola. When retrieving my order, I asked multiple times which bowl was which to confirm I was getting the one that was gluten-free. It wasn't until I was halfway into my bowl I realized I was told the wrong bowl and ended up feeling terrible all day. I would caution about going here if you have any food allergies or sensitivities as I do not have confidence in their customer service."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Found this place on yelp  and what a great find! The acai bowl was delicious and the oatmeal was amazing as well. Great start to our drive back home!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"i tried one of their açaí bowls and the cashew matcha drink- the açaí bowl was good, proportions were extremely filling. the matcha latte was absolutely amazing!! would definitely go again solely because of how good that drink was!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"A trip to SoCal is not complete without an Acai bowl! This was a great Acai bowl because I am very picky with the Acai, I've been to many places where the consistency is watery but this place did not disappoint! Also, they were very generous with the serving size! If you're in SB I would take a stop here!"

34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Pretty much my go to quick breakfast place. Standard backyard bowl is all I get.  It's bowls  fast and consistent with a generally friendly staff.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Delicious açaí bowl! One of the best I have had! We stopped in Santa Barbara on our way back to Bay Area. I will be back when I am in Santa Barbara!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I really really love their Island Bowl! I have been to diff acai places, but I can't seem to like any other acai bowl. I hope they will branch out to Orange County lol"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I was looking for a healthy option for breakfast  and I love local over chain  restaurants so I gave this a try. Really friendly staff and the food was super fresh and so very tasty. Next time you want an early start, give them a try!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"This morning it took over 40 minutes to get a bowl. We were the only people in line and three individuals received orders who arrived after us.

It was obvious that the online orders were being prioritized over in person patrons. Given COVID circumstances it was uneasy to sit and wait while countless to-go orders visited without wearing proper CDC protection. Backyard Bowls should change how they respond to customer orders and I will not be back until this happens."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I don't eat Açaí often but I got the Berry bowl and it was amazing. Fruit was fresh and delicious and the combination with the açaí and granola was great.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Overall very good experience. Diversified, tasty, food portions, nice deco... would give 5 if a bit more space to sit."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"love love love the service! love that the employees are happy to make each bowl customized! I appreciate when a place makes substitutions! It actually keeps me coming back almost everyday! Its also ridiculously good! So yummy, healthy and fresh! Thanks for making ""substitutions"" you guys are the best best best!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Well I had been wanting this for a long time. But they close early so I have never been able to get one til now. The flavors were great. I ordered to eat there then realized I needed to leave so I asked for it to be in a Togo cup. But they forgot which is not problem and offered to repack it in a to go after they brought it out to me. However when I left I quickly realize there was only like 1 cup of smoothie and the rest was fresh fruit etc. which is awesome. The ratio was just slightly off. I would have liked a bit more smoothie in my bow. So I'm wondering if during their ""repack"" of my Bowl Togo they lost some smoothie. I'll be back another time to check It out because it was great. We'll see I'm sure it was a fluke instance. Staff was super  nice and helpful."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious, delicious, delicious! I absolutely love Backyard Bowl. I feel so much better starting off my day with a bowl of fruit and acai!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I have always loved acai bowls and rarely have a very good one these days. However, I was in town for work, happened to see this on my map, and ended up coming here every day for breakfast! It's very popular so sometimes there's a wait (and not a ton of seating for the amount of people who come through), but it's worth it. Definitely recommend trying the backyard bowl and I also enjoyed the green one!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Really good...not sure how I never knew this was here?
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"This bowl was good but it want as great as it could be in comparison to others. Price per size is standard. 

The actual ingredients were okay. The granola wasn't as ""sweet"" or crunchy as id like. The coconut flakes were barely there which I think is one of the best parts of the bowl. Something about the taste brings all the flavored together. 

The fruits were good but the strawberries were more on the acidic side than the sweet side which would have been okay if there were more coconut flakes to help mellow out the flavored. 

Overall it was good but nothing spectacular."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,My husband and I must stop here any time we're in Santa Barbara! We are never disappointed. We grab an acai bowl here and a coffee next door!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I'm an avid fan of Backyard Bowl, and have gotten countless breakfast and açaí bowls. However, compared to the one at La Cumbre, this Backyard Bowl is really inconsistent with their service. Twice I've ordered online and arrived a couple minutes after the pickup time and they haven't even started making the order. If I put an add on like almonds or fruit they never put it until after they've prepared the order ""normally"" and I point out the add on. At one point I didn't want to go back after I had to wait so long for an order (that I had done online) that I ended up late to a function. The food itself is always great, I just wish the service was as great as the location at La Cumbre."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I was looking for an acai bowl when I came to Santa Barbara for the day and someone there told me to try this place out. Glad I asked the person about this place. I got the green bowl the first time. So happy they have one in LA now! I have been back to this location a few times and will definitely be back next time I'm in Santa Barbara.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Delicious, large acai bowls!

This place serves refreshing and large acai bowls. I got the Santa Barbara bowl, and I enjoyed the toppings and mixture that were in it. The fruits tasted fresh, and there were a fair amount of toppings. The only comment I have to say about the place is that I wish the bowl itself had a bigger diameter, which would allow more room for toppings or make it easier to eat the toppings with the acai (hopefully that made sense). The price of my bowl was about $12, which is very reasonable. Most acai bowls tend to be more expensive than this, but this was a reasonable price, and the bowl was worth it.

The employees were super friendly and patient with me (while I took quite a few minutes to decide). They all wore masks, and provided the bowls in a timely manner. This place is located in a small plaza, but the plaza isn't overly busy so parking should not be an issue. There are a few small tables outside for people to eat the bowls.

Overall, I highly recommend going to this place. It's delicious and worth it!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard Bowls is really fresh and delicious fruit bowls. My favorite is the berry bowl. This acai bowl is filled with strawberries, bananas, granola, blueberries and goji berries. The regular size is a good size, but if you have a big appetite the large should be considered. There was outside seating available, and facial covering & social distancing  practiced is used."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"We were driving down the coast looking for a place to get an açaí bowl. Their menu was very simple and they were located not too far from the freeway. We put in our order about 20 minutes before we got there and it was ready when we arrived. They had it waiting in a fridge, and the guy handed me my spoon wrapped in a napkin that I appreciated! It tasted delicious and the fruit was really fresh! All in all it was a great place to stop to get an açaí bowl, and they care about cleanliness! I got a regular sized Island Bowl and it was the perfect amount."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Poor service. Not enough trained staff waisted for 30 plus minutes for a small
Berry bowl!  Seemed very unorganized!!!
Great food but work in the service and getting the door out faster"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Everytime we visit Santa Barbara, we always stop by backyard bowls! The portions are huge and the fruit is sooooo fresh! Every bowl we've had was delicious!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Found a hair in my bowl. 
Very long hair. It was wrapped completely around my bowl. I usually really love this place but during Covid times everyone is kind of on edge and that includes me. Not a great look finding a huge piece of hair inside my food. Pretty upsetting."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is great to grab a healthy, quick bite right by State St in Santa Barbara. Their açaí bowls were huge and super filling and they have a lot of unique smoothie flavors. Also, I tried one of their breakfast bowls and they were great! Definitely a more sophisticated version of your average oatmeal. If I went back, the bowls would definitely be my first choice."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"HUGE PORTIONS!!! Plenty of options for toppings and flavors. Delicious thick acai! I hate it when they put so much apple juice in the acai that it comes out like soup. That is not the case here. They are very generous with the toppings. The people who work here are like ninjas. They work their butts off and chop at an alarmingly fast rate. This place is always packed, but they get you in and out fast!  Prices are very reasonable for the size and quality."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,just came in and got the island bowl. so good! perfect snack to end a day at the beach. staff was very nice and friendly even though we came in 10 minutes before closing. great experience will definitely be coming back in!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Pop in for a quick blended fruit bowl or smoothie. Always consistent and cheerful staff. I get the golden lion smoothie it's my favorite , along with any of the bowls :) ohh and parking is always available with the public lot being next door"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,The place to go for a healthy refreshing bowl of açaí breakfast goodness. Love the place!! The power bowl is my favorite.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Ok bowls. They didn't quite know what vegan means, but you can work it out and still get a bowl if you are vegan. The toast was also ok. Half was yummy and had a great fresh lemon flavor. The other half had a funky taste, maybe from one of the pickles. In a town that has great lunch and dinner options for vegans but not a lot for breakfast, this is still a decent place where you know you can eat something."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Yummy acai bowls and good quick breakfast spot to fuel you for your Santa Barbara adventure. I'm not sure I can give any acai place in the US a 5 star review after having the privilege of tasting the real thing in Brazil. Good value for the price for the amount of acai and fruit you get. They also make smoothies. 

I ordered a small Island bowl, which was more than enough for a light breakfast. Kept me full until a bigger lunch. 

Give Backyard Bowls a try if you're looking for an afternoon pick me up or a light breakfast."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Backyard Bowls is absolutely delicious. I especially love getting the Island Bowl with an addition of peanut butter; it's great cuz you can still taste the acai even with the peanut butter overtones! I think Backyard Bowls is probably the place that serves their bowls the fastest (of other vendors) as well.

My only problem with chain is their pricing. I've been to many acai bowl vendors and none of them have been as expensive as Backyard Bowls."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,A great acai place to eat at! Only downfall is that no one is really enforcing social distancing here and it does not look like they care that much about the safety of customers. I got the island bowl which was really good except they put excessive amounts of granola in this bowl. My friend ordered the berry bowl and hers did not come with as much granola as mines. I really like that they put a lot of fruits and overall worth the price. Would definitely come back when returning to SB.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This location is really good.  Literally always fresh, always a really good portion of fruit on top, and awesome menu.  Their island bowl is amazing.  
Their portions are pretty big.  We always feel totally full after just a small size.  For those of you on a restricted diet, they have tons of substitution options as well, which is awesome. 
The location is also great because the parking is free for I think 75 min?  Super convenient.  
Their toasts are also amazing if their toaster is working.  They have a nut butter one and avocado toast and both are great."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Blenders in the Grass may be the best along the Central Coast, but the amount of ice cream they put in their drinks is crazy. I was pretty familiar with Backyard Bowls since they have some locations in LA, but I didn't know they made smoothies as well. So before I got onto the freeway and headed down the 101, I decided to make a stop here instead for something a little ""healthier"".

The store is a short walk from State Street, next to a city parking lot. On the menu you will find acai bowls, oatmeals, coffee, avocado toasts, and other small food items and beverages. They have about eight smoothie flavors to choose from, with a couple fruity options and some really green ones like kale/spinach. From what I remember, there's only one 20 oz size and it's somewhere around $9. It wasn't crowded when I came on a weekend afternoon, but I was told that my order will be ready in 15 minutes. I spent that time at Maya Chocolate next door, picking up a few gift boxes.

I got the Blueberry Fields smoothie. The ingredients are listed on the menu: the base is strawberries, blueberries, and bananas, which is blended with coconut/cashew mylk, along with a touch of vanilla, honey, lavender, and a pinch of pollen and chia seeds sprinkled on top. The consistency is much thicker compared to your average smoothie, which did not go well with the narrow paper straws they provided; I was actually given two straws, which seems more wasteful looking back.

All in all, it was refreshing and flavorful. The blueberries are definitely more pronounced with just a few hints of banana. The pollen had a very interesting taste, giving the smoothie an earthy and nutty feel. My first straw gave way when I was halfway through, and I used the second one to finish it up. I would come back to try their acai bowls."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Great place to pick up an açai bowl! They have many options for healthy choices. We ordered two different açai bowls. The service was very quick Arboles came out in about 5 to 10 minutes. The fruit was fresh and sweet. They also ask if you'd like to drizzle honey on top of the açai bowl. Which we of course said yes too! The balls were refreshing! And the serving size is quite large! Would recommend
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Staying in Santa Barbara and we were craving an Açaí bowl. We found Backyard Bowls and glad we tried it. The wait was about 20 minutes but well worth it. Outside/inside seating is nice and clean, parking looked tough but we walked so it wasn't a problem. The bowls are large and delicious,two sizes to choose from and we ordered the regular and it was plenty. We both ordered the power bowl and really enjoyed them. We will definitely come here again when vacationing in Santa Barbara or passing through to Wine Country. Enjoy!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Came here because I was nearby and thought it was a good place because of the reviews. The atmosphere is friendly and there were a lot of people sitting outside but no one in line. Since there was no one in front of us we thought that the order would be quick but we waited at least 25 minutes for 2 kid bowls. Waiting was fine, but the reason I give 2 stars is because there was a hair in my berry bowl!! It did taste good but seeing hair in my food is VERY UNSANITARY. Beware of this before coming."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"When you ignore substitutions based on allergies you put people health at risk. The community trusts you to be reading delivery orders, especially when you ask for specified ingredients to be added/omitted, not being there to watch to make sure an allergy substitute is not accidentally added."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Unique offerings and pure delicious. Excellent choices for avoiding high cholesterol breakfasts! The oatmeal bowls are so creamy and loaded with great toppings.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Tried a couple takeout acai bowls.  Getting to the place driving wise is fine.  The parking lot is busy, probably busy most of the time.  Menu is clear and staff is polite.  Staff is helpful to explain availability of items.  Regular bowl was enough with plenty of fruit.  Would visit again."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"First, I'd like to start off by saying......... THEIR BOWLS ARE HUGE. 1 large bowl is great for sharing, but if you have a bf like mines, he doesn't like sharing. Great.... Now I'm stuck with a huge bowl myself. What made it worse was that I wanted the Santa Barbara bowl, which only comes in the large size $12. Bf got the large Berry bowl $12. Each large bowl is 32 oz. These bowls are quality. You can taste it. Also, they use local honey which they do sell there so that's awesome! This meal is super filling and healthy. Packed with lots of fruits, the possibilities are endless."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I had the best acai bowl i've ever had here. The backyard bowl is literally the best! It's a little expensive but it definitely filled me up as much as any other meal! Sooo good.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"THE GREEN BOWL IS LIFE. 

Bottom: Acaí, Banana, Broccoli, Spinach, Ginger, Lime & Apple Juice
Top:  Strawberry, Blueberry, Granola & Honey

Fresh bowls, friendly staff, open air seating. No bathroom but there's one in the coffee shop next door."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The dragon bowl, and the P&J quinoa were delicious. Healthy and feeling breakfast. Portions are generous."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Cute spot to visit. Bowls are a great size and very filling. The last few times I ordered a dragon bowl it lacked flavor. Very friendly staff!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Mmmm loved my bowl from BYB! The kids size was plenty for me and honestly I could have even split that. Wished there were more kids size bowl options, but not a big deal. They absolutely don't skimp on the fruit toppings here and the acai was really tasty, not too sweat. Overall I think this is a great acai bowl place!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Pretty decent place to grab a bite. I shared a protein bowl with my boyfriend and they split a small into 2 bowls which was nice. A bit pricey, but that's to be expected. A good selection of flavors compared to most places that offer acai bowls."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Our story starts here: 

We walk in. It's casual Sunday morning, slightly overcast, roughly 70°. I approach the counter and order my Island Bowl (the best one don't even try any others), my roommate (who is a novice to the art of açaí) asks: ""may I just have the base with strawberries and granola?"". They looked at him like he was crazy. After a long exchange and the help of another employee, he got what he wanted. Overall, best spot to eat açaí."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,I enjoyed my berry açaí bowl. Service with a smile. I did think that the regular would have more açaí in it.  Oh well.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Santa Barbara Bowl (Acai, Banana, Strawberry, Hemp Mylk, Granola, Banana, Strawberry, Blueberry, Goji Berry, Bee Pollen, Honey) - Overall, good. I actually did not like how tall the cup was, making the mixing and digging for acai really difficult. Goji berry was a nice, unique touch.

Portions are large and need two people to finish."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"I was disappointed with the service, and presentation of my meal.  Ordered avocado toast, waited 15 minutes.  Watched while others, who had ordered long after me put up their orders, then inquired about mine.  I was told it was on its way, offered to get something different, they said my order was on its way.  Waited another 10 minutes, nothing.  Inquired again, only to be told the oven was not working, again offered to order something else, they said it was on its way....waited another 10 minutes only to get a uncooked egg on top of a piece of toast with a little avocado.  Its too bad that the employees are not taught customer service and communication.  My experience could have been much better if I was told straight up the oven was not working."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Loved the blue moon smoothie highly recommend. Also got the Island Bowl (not pictured) which was so fresh and delicious and even a regular seemed like it was pretty big for a portion
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Honestly I love backyard bowls and am never disappointed with what I order here, but I knocked off two stars because of how long it takes to get your food!!I always order ahead of time through the app and today I place my order at 12:04 and I was told me food would be ready around 12:24. I showed up at 12:30 and they told me it won't be ready for another 20 minutes. I understand business's get busy, but the app should reflect the correct time so that customers aren't stuck waiting for their food over 30 minutes past when it was supposed to be done. This has happened to me at this location so many times and I'm not sure if I'll keep coming here. My husband even ordered one time on the app and it gave him his pick up time so he went over on his lunch break and and it wasn't ready. After waiting for 20 minutes he had to leave and never got his food he had paid for."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Get the green bowl!! You can't taste the veggies at ALL because of how flavorful the fruits used are, and the granola is my favorite ever. The small size is perfect for breakfast, and also conveniently comes in a cup. Highly recommend the delicious, nutritious bowls here for your daily dose of fiber and vitamins, and the employees and both friendly and very efficient/fast. Forgot to take a photo because I was already halfway through my bowl!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I forgot to take a picture cuz I was mesmerized by the Warrior Bowl when I picked it up from the counter! The pile of almond butter (and honey) oozing over the top of all the other goodies... omg. 

It was my first visit to Backyard Bowls and this was one of, if not THE best, smoothie bowl I've ever had!

I got the regular size (which is huge!) and I've been full for hours. Highly recommend!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Acaiiiiiii!!!

This is by far better than Jamba Juice's Acai smoothie. We stopped in for breakfast. Lots of 75 min parking out of front, which was great. They have a small seating area inside, a bench out front and about 4 tables in what looks like a side garage. I like the organic-ness of this place.

We ordered 2 minis- Berry Bowl and the Island Bowl and the Acai Smoothie. Total was $18. The portion is very generous. You can probably split a mini (child's portion). I ate half of my bowl and I was already full! 

What I enjoyed the most is the granola. Super crunchy! I wish I would have ordered more since I like the crunch factor. The fruit used is super sweet and the honey is what made the Acai even more delicious!

I wish they had one of these in SD. I can easily get addicted to this!!!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Had an açaí bowl and shared an avocado toast. The bowl was fine, have definitely had better. The toast was good but not amazing. For healthy food in the area, it's a great option."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Very cute place with tables to sit at. When taking order, it was hard to hear the person taking the order because of the blenders in the back. So with the very loud noise, the cashier got our order wrong but they were nice to remake our order and refund us. 
Got the Island Bowl and the Blueberry Fields smoothie. The bowl was amazing and a lot of toppings. The smoothie had a good taste that kind of tasted like blueberry yogurt. 
They give compostable spoons and paper straws (hard to drink out of). 
Overall, great place but loud."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"It's amazing! Visitors SB for spring break and went two days in a row for breakfast. Had the Island bowl one day and the coco cado bowl another. Both delicious. Highly recommend. Fresh, quick service, friendly staff. Didn't even get to take pictures cause I scarfed them down both days."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Came to Backyard Bowls for the first time and was not disappointed! It definitely lives up to their yelp reviews. I got the Island Bowl without granola and an açai smoothie, and both were super natural tasting while sweet and delicious. Loved the strawberry, coconut and honey combo at the top! However, giving them 4 stars because of slightly subpar service. They messed up my order twice, and was very slow. I came at closing time, with not many people there, but ended up waiting 15-20 minutes."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Backyard Bowls has the best acai bowls. I love how they are served in cute and colorful glass bowls. Try their island bowl!!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"My Island Bowl perfectly hit the spot for a light and fruity lunch! I'm not a local, but if I come back I'd like to get that again with a bit of peanut butter drizzled on top to make it just a tad richer. I'd also probably get it to go in the future - the place was really loud, and you don't have to go far for some really nice beach views."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,negative,"Disclaimer- I am hangry as I'm writing this.

On a Tuesday morning at 9am I ordered 1 açaí bowl - the backyard bowl. After processing my credit card and being asked about including a tip for the team (which I did) they then told me it would be a 20-25 minute wait. WHAT?! That seemed excessive as there were 2 people who ordered ahead of me.

So I'm patiently waiting and more and more orders come in from other people and the orders of others are being filled BEFORE me and I see they also got açaí bowls so it's not like it was a simple drink! It's now been about 40 minutes and we are STILL waiting for 1 açaí bowl. And it's a basic one too! No additions or customizations! 

POST EATING- here's the thing, their açaí bowls are delicious so would I come here again? Yes- with the caveat of not coming hungry and preparing to wait.

Parking - we got free street parking for 75 min. There is also a parking lot (not sure if it's free).

Ample seating outside."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Yum! One of the best I've had since my fav place closed in Bay Area. We will be back!
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"These bowl artisans know whats up 
I asked for peanut butter - they DELIVERED 
Some honey on top?? DELIVERED 
Made with love ? You guessed it ! 
Yeah you know what, it's a lil pricy (not horrible for SB) but its the price you pay for p~e~r~f~e~c~t~i~o~n (also- its a HUGE portion) 
Keep up the awesome work!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"The flagship store!!! This should be a landmark in SANTA BARBARA, the place where backyard bowls started it's Açaí domination. Simply put, best in class. Delicious, nutritious, quality ingredients. GO there NOW, thank me later!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Just in case you are a complete newb like me, I'll explain what a bowl is.   There's a base which is an icy, cold smoothie and then you have the toppings.  The menu for the bowls tells you what ingredients will be blended to make the base and then tells you what the toppings will be.  

In retrospect, going to Backyard Bowls on a crisp October morning for a cold bowl of brekkie wouldn't be my first choice, if I were to do it again.  Don't get me wrong, they're delicious, but not what I want when it's kinda chilly out. 

I bet they are great when it's hot and you want something refreshing.

There was no queue when we went as we got there before the rush."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"They always make such great acai bowls! More importantly, their customer service has me coming back because if they don't get it right, they are quick to own up to the misunderstanding! 

Thanks for always delivering my somewhat ""complicated"" order"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"I'm a mega fan of this great joint! They have delicious bowls and tasty smoothies!

I highly recommend the quinoa bowl, adding banana. It's chucked full of fresh cut strawberries and blueberries, roasted pecans, a hint of cinnamon and warm cashew milk. It's comforting, healthy and tastes heavenly!

Also delicious is the oatmeal meal which you can customize with your personal selection of one fruit and sweetener (honey, brown sugar, or agave nectar). 

From the smoothies, I've tried the Popeye, which I love! Spinach, broccoli, ginger and some fruit but it tastes wonderful and not like green produce. My only recommendation to improve this yummy drink would be to cut back on the ginger which can add an overpowering bite in the aftertaste. 

Some tips for the management...stay consistent on the preparation of the quinoa. 3 out of 3 times that I have come there it was not ready and I had to wait 15 minutes for it to be cooked. It looks like they use crock pots to prepare it so I recommend having two crock pots and making it simultaneously so that you rarely, if not never, run out. Also, it would be great if the nutrition facts (calories) were posted on the menu right next to the menu item, instead of having to ask for the clipboard. 

TIps for you the consumer! 

Tip 1: They have a punch card for frequent diners that works a little differently than traditional punch cards and is all about promoting being green, as well as, being a regular. Here's how you can earn stamps on your card:
1. Get your bowl ""for here"" and dine in
2. Bring your own bowl 
3. Bring back your biodegradable cup from your smoothie on your next visit so they can compost it =)

Tip 2: You can view the nutrition facts by asking to see their clipboard or going to their website.

Wahla! Go enjoy and Yelp about your favorite selections from their extensive menu!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Absolutely loved their island bowl, went back and got it again the next day! Also got the avocado toast which was great. Such fresh ingredients and such friendly employees! Will definitely go back any chance that I get!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This place is a fun, cute, hipster place and I love their healthy vibe. They specialize in breakfast bowls and smoothies made from yummy delicious fruit. They also have other things like goji berries, acai, almond milk, etc that you don't normally see at a Jamba Juice.

Their small size bowl is HUGE so I got the kids berry bowl which was absolutely delicious. It had yummy bananas, strawberries, goji berries, granola and honey and probably some other berries in it as well. 

I also got some coffee and I love that they offer yerba mate there because I weirdly like mixing my yerba mate with my coffee. 
The service was a little scattered. The cash register girl was kinda spacey and didn't seem to know much about the menu. The seating is in a covered outside area and I really liked that. 

They have tons of options and choices and I am sure there is something here for everyone. If you are a bit turned off by uber healthy food, this may not be the place for you! My husband definitely went next door for his breakfast needs at SB Roasting Company."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Great place for a quick breakfast in Santa Barbara. Go here if you love açaí bowls because they have so many options!! Bowls are huge (24oz is standard size) but very filling. Got the power bowl which was filled with bananas, blueberries, granola, and peanut butter. 

No indoor seating, but they do have a tiny outside patio or you can get to go."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Of the 3 selections - all selections were picture perfect -  bowl of porridge was the best - hot and delicious with honey on top and bananas. Açaí bowl was good though a tad cold - Avocado on toast - spouts were slightly tasteless and toast cold - good atmosphere to this place - note - limited seating so get there early.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"We tried looking for some brunch places that weren't too packed and didn't have a long waitlist, but decided on Backyard Bowls instead. Can't go wrong with a healthy acai bowl to start off your morning!

My boyfriend ordered a large Green Bowl and I ordered an Avocado + Egg Toast. I'm not a smoothie/sweets-for-breakfast-type, so I wanted to eat something savory. They had a promo going on for a free Dune coffee if you got a Green Bowl, so my boyfriend took advantage of that. Also, the toast does take a little longer to make, but we just grabbed some coffee next door.  The Green Bowl was really tasty! Because there's ginger in it, I was a little worried that it could overpower the rest of the ingredients, but everything complemented each other nicely. It wasn't too sweet and I loved the crunch and honey drizzled on top. The large size is HUGE btw, so you get your bang for your buck. My toast was pretty solid - lots of avocado spread and I love the little spice from the harissa. The sunny-side egg was runny on top, which made it so much creamier. So delicious and didn't feel like a heavy breakfast at all, so I felt energized for the rest of the morning.

If you're a fan of natural and fresh acai bowls, come to Backyard Bowls! There's a few outdoor tables to sit around and enjoy your breakfast with some good company. :)"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"One of my favorite spots in Santa Barbara! Not only are the açaí bowls top notch but the service is consistently excellent. 

My favorite is the power bowl with added bee pollen. I'm all about dat peanut butter lifestyle. The ingredients are açaí, peanut butter(!), banana, blueberry, pea protein, hemp milk base, and its topped with granola, almonds, banana, blueberry, hemp seeds, honey! I add the bee pollen because it adds a nice, unique taste. Chalky yet slightly crunchy. 

The portions are very filling (more of a meal than a snack). They also have a great coffee spot next store in case you need your caffeine fix!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"YUMMILICIOUS is the word that immediately pops in my head when i think of Backyard Bowls! If you've never had an Acai bowl you definitely MUST try it ASAP! But they also offer create your own bowls or even oatmeal options or just straight up smoothies if you're looking for something else. This place is literally a hole in the wall place that looks like it was converted from an old autoshop with the sliding garage door still in the tiny dining area. 

We had:
Berry bowl: Blended: Acaí, Banana, Strawberries, & Apple Juice
Toppings: Banana, Fresh Berries, Goji Berries, Granola & Honey sprinkled with cinnamon. This small bowl was actually just enough for one person or you could definitely share. If you've never had an acai bowl it's pretty much like an acai smoothie on the bottom topped with fruits, granola and drizzled with honey on top. Best of all it's all organic! WIN WIN WIN! This bowl compared to the backyard bowl was abit more tart and tangy.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=n89MZJN_r8aKa6e6tx20jQ&userid=RS4AjuF4glgClCkdgD4nDA

Backyard bowl:
Blended: Acaí, Acerola , Banana, Strawberry & Hemp Milk
Toppings: Banana, Fresh Berries, Goji Berries, Bee Pollen, Granola & Honey
This bowl was only available in large strangely enough. And DAMN was it LARGE! I had a hard time trying to finish this one by my self as it's probably a better idea to share this one... but like i said this bowl's acai bottom was abit more creamy probably from the hemp milk. But overall flavor wise it was almost identical.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Li9Mkt7v0rVD-87wQaByAw&userid=RS4AjuF4glgClCkdgD4nDA

It definitely takes awhile to get your order when they're busy in the morning. So if you're in a rush definitely preorder through their mobile app or call in your order! Also seating is very limited so it's probably a better bet to take it togo and enjoy the beautiful weather of Santa Barbara while enjoying your bowl."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"This was my pre- and post-paddle boarding fuel over Labor Day weekend. 

What I had:
1. Cocoa Almond Bowl: fantastic. It was like eating chocolate frozen yogurt with some of the best granola I've had. 
2. Green Bowl, with half the amount of ginger, subbed cashew milk for the apple juice: also delicious, more healthy-tasting, and less indulgent than the Cocoa Almond Bowl. Opting for the cashew milk instead of apple juice was intended to cut down on sugar content and it was still sweet enough, perfect actually.

I got the humongous ""small"" size both times and I finished them just fine, but I can eat. Like a lot. My friend got the ""child"" size and he thought that was too much. I'd say a ""small"" is enough for two to share or for one physically active bottomless pit.

Free 75 minute parking in a lot right in front and several dining tables make it easy to visit and indulge your healthier side. I'm in love with this place!"
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,"Just passing through from LA to Solvang and saw the good reviews on yelp so decided to stop for an açaí / smoothie bowl. Definitely one of the best I've had, down to the last bite. Ordered the Green Bowl."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Wonderful base and all of the right toppings. Great service and a clientele that clearly appreciated the good vibe. Outstanding experience all around. Will be back when in town.
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,American,positive,Backyard Bowls taste so delicious! A really good place to go to for acai/pitaya bowls! The fruits taste really fresh and cold! + The size is perfect! Would definitely recommend!
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Okay, I'm obsessed with the chocolate pancakes from IHOP but they are not worth it when the service is SHIT. My server comes to the table asked me what I wanted to order for a drink, I ask a few questions about the mimosas. He said ""No just Orange juice and Champagne"" I say then I'll getting something else AND HE WALKED AWAY BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE. I was appalled. This man was older so he had no excuse for his ignorance. I am so disappointed with this establishment. If I could give negative stars I would. Do not go here, it is not worth it."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,Came to eat overly hungry and late. Maria our server was so nice and helpful. Food hit the spot and the whole experience was wonderful.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"We arrived over an hour before the posted closing time, and were greeted with ""I'm closing early.""  So much for IHOP, we went to Dave's Dogs across the freeway and had a good meal -- and they stayed open.  If I had pulled something like that when I was in food service I would have been fired!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Needed dinner and a pick-me-up for my drive home. Sat at the bar, thinking that would be quicker. NOT. Once I was seated I was ignored. Finally I placed the order with water to drink. No water was delivered!! I decided I would order an iced mocha and it was brought promptly. It was not your typical iced mocha. When I asked how they prepared it he said they mixed ""the syrup"" with their prepared iced coffee. I asked what type of syrup and he said it was something like German white chocolate? Waiter said ""This is how WE make it"". I suppose I should have asked how they make it before I ordered it. I asked if they had any hershey syrup I could mix in to make it better and he said no. He did not charge me for the coffee, though, at least that was OK. Iced mochas usually are milk and espresso and some sort of thick dark chocolate syrup mixture. This might have been some sort of Torino syrup. Horrible. He brought me water instead (finally). 

Anyway, the eggs and bacon were good, french toast was barely warm. I had to ask for more butter, which didn't melt on the french toast. Syrup was cold, don't know if I could have asked for warm syrup or not. The hash browns were not good. Again, barely warm. The dark parts were cooked straight on the grill with no oil to make them deliciously crispy. As a result they were just hard and tasted a bit burned. I ate the inside part with salt and ketchup. 

Reasonably priced meal ($10.29) but I expected more from a specialty restaurant like this. The service was almost non-existent, and they weren't hardly busy. No check-backs after I had my meal, had to have the manager get me more butter. I wouldn't stop at this location again, even though it was conveniently off the highway."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Very hit or miss. Sometimes you get a good waiter who is nice, polite and gets everything right or replaces it immidiately.  Sometimes you get a terrible waiter who is rude, doesnt want to help and doesnt do his job properly.
In any case the food is decent and the two managers I have spoken to are rude and unhelpful.
If you want my opinion the one downtown is much better."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,Typical IHOP.  Clean and friendly service.  Came at an off time.  Quick service.  Enjoyed it.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Our closest iHop, we really appreciate the consistency of the breakfast food. My husband loves the international passport breakfast with Swedish pancakes and compared to other iHops, we find the crepes to be the thinnest, lightest, and best! We prefer our bacon extra crispy and they do it every time perfectly as well as being able to poach eggs exactly as ordered. I find the nutritional info now on the menu to be informative and now have the veggie omlet with roasted tomato as a great bang for my calorie buck! Coffee could stand big improvement, as could canned o.j., but we find this to be the best of the big chain iHops. Some times are quite busy, so take it into consideration when planning your time there. Servers are friendly and accommodating. Still our go-to breakfast place."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"1. Waiters do not speak English here - minus one star 

2. I ordered pancakes and they brought me tilapia - minus one star 

3. They fixed it quickly so I'll add a star 

4. I asked 3 different waiters for sour cream and it took 15 minutes for an English speaker to finally figure it out - minus one star 

5. Food was bland, toast was burnt, and the environment felt like Iat a road side diner on the way to Vegas. Not in a good way either. - minus one star"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"The one consistent thing about IHOP is the breakfast menu. Always good no matter which IHOP you eat at. I had a nice little fun plate with 5 silver dollar pancakes, Nutella, banana slices and 3 juicy and sweet strawberries and my husband had a Nutella crepe plate. Very good! Service although very sweet, extremely slow for an almost empty house. One thing I learned working for IHOP myself, is accuracy and QUICK service. Service is too slow for an IHOP and attentive waitress????? Where is she? Hello!!!!!!.........Thus my three star rating."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,The food was okay but they setted us very close to the bathroom so I believe they didn't clean very well then smell was there not too happy
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"If you like good omelettes, then you will like this particular IHOP!  The omelettes are consistently good - and of course, so are the pancakes (which my husband always orders as 'a side to go'). 

The management for the last several years have hired very good cook. We have tried other IHOPS from Los Angeles to the north of the Central Coast, and the omelettes of the  other IHOPS just can't compare. 

IHOP offers dietary and allergy info about all of their products - which can be viewed and downloaded from their website. This is particularly helpful for my niece who needs a gluten-free menu - which they do offer. It's not an extensive gluten-free cuisine, but we like how conscientiously they are about the break-down of what they offer. 

The staff at this IHOP are very friendly - and so are the managers, who we always thank when leaving. Keep up the good work! 

Thank you, Turnpike/Calle Real IHOP!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,-1 star literally the worst experience. The staff was okay but I got my coffee and it was terrible. My friend paid $10 for a tiny apple juice and a shitty milkshake that somehow tasted like chalk and she took two sips out of. It was ridiculous. We actually canceled our order to go to Cajun kitchen because it was just the worst. How do you mess up coffee so bad that I have to leave? Never ever go here it was awful.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Always friendly, clean and fast, professional service. For a commercial chain, their breakfast and lunches are very good, not greasy, and the wait service is excellent!  We will return!! Love both IHOPS, one on State St., and the Goleta one!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Came here for dinner on Sunday night. We put in our order and noticed after some time waiting that people around us were getting their orders sooner even though they had gotten there after us. My wife decided to go ask after a 40 min wait. The waiter said that he forgot to put in the order. He was like I'll put it in now, like it was no big deal. We were like what??? Don' bother we are leaving. We will never be going back. Lost our business for good."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Why would I ever want to pay $15 for mediocre pancakes when I can get amazing food at many other higher end restaurants for the same price? Sorry, IHOP, you were supposed to be cheap, yummy breakfast food but now it is just way too expensive."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Had super great service and tasty food.  We went for dinner and then again for brunch the next day.  Of course the service and wait for food were better at dinner, but we only waited 10 minutes to sit and still had attentive service (including to-go drinks) during a weekend brunch time.  Watching what we are eating, so it was hard to not be tempted by all the yummy looking pancakes and crepes.  The place was clean and everyone was courteous and eager to please."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"So ive been to place several times over the years. I was just basic.I just don't really know about this place. I was in there a week ago(after about a year since my last visit) and had a good meal and great service. The young man who was in charge at the diner area was awesome. The Food was perfect. Hot tasty I left very happy. So being in the area again I decided to go again but this time were back to the old ways. Cold bland food and the hash browns, why can't this place get hash browns right.  They look crispy but then they are just not cooked properly through and through. Service was horrible. The old guy at behind the  counter really needs to give it up. He just tries to do everything  but can't do it right. 1 glass of water the whole meal because he's busy worried about everyone else.
The week before he was NOT there, so maybe that's why everything was great. I am just done with going here."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Staying at the Ramada so I ordered a meal for myself to go. I go and pick it up, and it's $18 for the fried steak meal (with eggs, hash browns and pancakes) and a cup of coffee. That seems a little ridiculous to me for ihop. Also, hours after eating it, I got food poisoning. Save yourself the money and your health."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,Worst service ever. One of the spoons had egg yolk on it. Waitress didn't come back ro check on us one time. We didn't even get one refill. Food was moderately terrible as well.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"I got the Tuscan scramble with harvest grain pancakes, my husband and I split them, delicious! 
We've been to this I hop several times, with wonderful service. I've ordered poached eggs, scrambled, over medium and the eggs were cooked perfectly every time."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"It's an IHOP, so I shouldn't have expected much, but this was lower than mediocre. I ordered the Tilapia which came with soup or salad. The soup was clam chowder. To their benefit, it came quickly, but whatever came was not clam chowder. It was some oily liquid with some chunks of potato. I sent it back and got the salad with vinaigrette on the side. The salad comes out, and it is basically lettuce with some tomato diced to the point you needed a spoon to eat it (think pick de gallo). And it came with a side of ranch. So I sent the ranch back and asked for my side of vinaigrette. He brought out bottles of separate oil and vinegar. Ok, we are getting there, but how am I supposed to use this without dousing my salad in it? There's no bowl or anything. I give up.  I try to muscle through and just ate the salad plain. The tilapia was nothing to write home about. I asked for lemon and hot sauce. That made it palatable. I should have just stayed home and cooked myself. It would have been faster, cheaper, and less taxing on my nerves."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Typical IHOP. Great food, good service.

I kinda had a hard time finding this place, though. It's kinda tucked away in a weird part of Calle Real I've never ventured on."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"We came around 1pm, so I expected them to be busy but the service was terrible. I ordered a coffee and there was lipstick on the cup, it hadn't even been washed. We waited 30 minutes and finally received our food which was poorly cooked and I had to ASK for silverware...No one ever came to check on us, and we had to hunt down a waiter just to get the check and leave. I don't recommend going here if you're expecting to be served properly."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"This was by far the worst service I have ever had. The restaurant was dead besides two groups of people throughout the whole store and there were 6 servers sitting at the front register seeming to do nothing when we walked in and after we were seated, we sat for 15 minutes before anyone bothered to ask us what we wanted to drink. The food was barely cooked and cold and I will probably never go to an ihop again."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,Typical IHOP food.. They messed up my order twice in one sitting. Gave me the wrong pancakes and scrambled eggs instead of sunny side up even though the order was clear.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,Hello I am still currently waiting for my food and I've been here for 50 minutes. I normally love ihop but do I today? Not really. Because of the food not being here that I mentioned. Everything else is fine. Just not having the food that we ordered a long time ago. Toilet could also be cleaner.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Look out, Denny's, this place is starting to become my husband's and my special goto for breakfast for dinner. So very good. The portions are large, but yummy. I like the blueberry syrup and the staff is very friendly."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"It's IHOP folks.  The pancakes are of course delicious.  The wait on the weekend is better than most breakfast places in town and you can usually find a good coupon.  The bacon tastes weird and its hit and miss with the waitstaff.  I like that they have vanilla creamer for the coffee, but I have a theory that they serve decaffeinated coffee to everyone because I always leave tired.... maybe that's because I eat 2000 calories of pancakes every time I go. :)"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"I have no idea why this place has such bad reviews . 
Came here at 9:30pm and wanted some yummy breakfast, and it was amazing. 
Me and my boyfriend were able to watch the movie that was playing on their flat screen while waiting for our food. 
Salvador was our waiter and he was on top of everything, and was really nice. 
We for sure want to come her more often
FOOD WAS AMAZING !"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"I've always had an issue with customer service as well as always getting orders wrong here, they ruin the iHop reputation"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,Horrible service. 15 minutes of sitting at the counter waiting for someone to take my order; I had to leave. I only have 30 mins on my lunch break.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Typically I like IHOP, I mean who doesn't love pancakes? This IHOP is near my work so I sometimes come here for lunch and without exception the service here is consistently the slowest and least engaging of any restaurant I have ever been to. They are usually understaffed and the one person who is working is overworked and underattentive. Right now there is one host, one server and one cook and apparently no busboy because there are 5 tables full of leftover dishes and food (not an exaggeration, I took pictures. It's disgusting!). Not sure why the hostess can't grab a pan and clean these tables up, she's just standing at the cash register doing nothing right now. I know it's my fault - I know better by now - I should never come here and neither should you!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"This is the second time with bad experience. This time my sister found something crawling in her coffee(not sure how to post picture with my comment). Makes me wonder if the coffee pot is cleaned after each use. Definitely they don't look inside the cup while pouring coffee. We let the manager aware.
I don't think I'll be coming back."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,The worst service ever! The employees spoke in spanish the whole time which was annoying. The food was horrible and to top it off they all talked about me in spanish thinking that I didnt understand what they were saying. Sorry guys I am bi lingual and I did not appreciate the profane thing you were saying about me. Tried to get refund for meal but assistant manager said he needed to call his manager to refund me. Bad overall experience. I should have went to In and Out for a meal that is edible and has good service.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,Food was consistent with IHOP's usually yummy breakfast choices and the service was outstanding! Very pleased with my experience at this location!

Party of 2 I ordered egg whites & bacon my food came 20 minutes after they brought my boyfriends. Really?"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,It was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. Terrible service they gave my mom the wrong order she's allergic to peanut butter and she told them she wanted the berry one then instead of making a new one the cooks just wipe off the peanut butter and serve it to her she had a reaction right away and when we brought this to the servers attention he lied and said it comes with peanut butter then the manager of the restaurant yelled at my husband and refused to give a refund! Worst place worst service!!! Don't eat there!!!!
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Arno and Leo said Hi as we walked in. We were escorted to our booth by Arno. He asked for our drink order. Brought our drinks and took our order for grilled Cheese steak and onion sandwich with a bowl of clam chowder. Clam Chowder served first, added some parmesan cheese instead of salt. Almost as good as Dad made in the good old days.
Sandwich was well packed with meat, grilled onions and sauce. I added a little French's mustard, slice it in thirds; much easier to hold. Best sandwich I have had in a while.

Dottie had The 55 sunrise with bacon, hash browns well done, Eggs over easy and a single crepe with sweet cream and strawberries. Scrumptious. We eat at this IHOP or the one on State and Valerio twice a month or more. 

Always good service, never disappointed in the meals. Good friends serve Dottie and I well."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"My food was very delicious tonight. I had the bacon temptation omelette with chocolate pancakes and my husband had the build your own.... eggs, sausage, hash brown and red velvet pancakes... yummy! our orange juice and shake were very good too. Shout out to Karla, Carlos, the older gentlemen helping bring food/drinks to the table and the crew tonight working very hard! Thank you guys!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Wow this IHOP was absolutely terrible. I could have made better eggs and hash browns at home, next time I will."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Usually Ienjoy meals here at IHOP, but I have to tell DON'T ORDER THE POBLANO OMELETTE ! It is suppose to be spicy, but its not. The ""shredded beef"" was not, it was pieces ! Also it was ""very bland"" no taste. The only spicy flavor came from the sauce n jalapenos. Told the waiter, he said he would tell the manager, who said, if he ate some we won't offer any deals ! Are you kidding me !"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"We came here for lunch as we were staying one night at the Ramada right across the street. Haven't eaten at an Ihop in years. Seems pretty much as I remembered it. Comparable to Denny's. You kind of know what to expect at places like this. Quality not too high, but ok food for a quick meal when you are traveling. The waiter was nice enough. My T-bone steak was actually kind of good, and nicely grilled. I also liked the broccoli and home fries it came with. Overall made for a good quick lunch."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"If I could put 0 stars I would. Me and my friends sat for over 20 minutes without anyone coming to the table. I finally waved down a worker and asked if we could at least order drinks and the reply was ""give me one minute"". Another 5 to 10 minutes went by, we finally stood up and walked out. The restaurant was not busy at all! There was one table by us that seemed to be waiting as well. Absolutely horrible, will not be returning."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,This is the worst I hop I have ever came to ! Poor service ! They didn't bring our sides until we paid bill in a to go bag  and they still charged us ! Like what the heck ! Also we had to wait almost 25 minuets for  utensils !! Don't come here
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Don't ever visit this IHOP. I'm usually understanding about customer service that doesn't meet expectations, and there's usually a reasonable cause I can write it off as. But this was just terrible. 

First, after the drink orders were taken and delivered and we ordered our food, we didn't see a waiter for the next half an hour. It was not busy. They didn't even ttry to get out of customer line of sight. They just chilled behind the counter. I used to work in the food industry, so I could imagine a lot going wrong, so I wasn't upset. 

When the food did come, not only was stuff missing, but one of the orders was changed. One of the things we were missing was three orders of toast. We could see the toast in the toaster. Not sure why the toaster is out front but that's not a service issue. It had been sitting there for ten minutes. Aftir the waitress thought she was done, we mentioned that we were missing the toast. She grabbed the toast from one of the toasters, brought it over and ignored the other toast literally right next to it. We said we were still missing two orders, and she brought another one, then just sort of left. At this point we really didn't feel like asking a third time for toast. One of our party also got sausage she didn't order. An order of french fries just sort of didn't show up. 

About the same time as the toast, we also noticed we didn't have enough silverware for the six of us. We asked for 2 more sets. We got one about 5 minutes later. We grabbed another set from the breakfast bar so we could all eat. 

By the time the food had been delivered, only two people didn't have an empty glass. For one of them, this was because the ""strawberry lemonade"" she ordered tasted like they had diluted the lemonade with water, emptied a sugar packet into it and thew in 2 strawberries. The other had barely touched her water but they took it away without bothering to ask, presumably to refill it. It came back about ten minutes later. 

During the entire visit, which lasted about an hour and a half, the waitress only came by when we got her attention from across the restaurant, save for the food delivery. When she did, it was very obvious that she did not want to have to serve anyone. By the time the food arrived, we just wanted to leave. The hostess was nice, did nothing wrong and although he made mistakes, the man that seemed to be the manager was nice. But it was very obvious that we were in no way satisfied with the service and none of the staff seemed to want to address that. 

In the end, we simply left without paying a tip. We didn't feel like being there longer than we had to nor did we feel like causing a scene. Hopefully the lack of tip will send the message across that if they want to stay in business, especially as a well-known franchise like IHOP, they'll need to step up service to an acceptable level."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Came here yesterday for breakfast with my friend and her sisters. We did have to wait a while, but not too long. Our waiter, I believe his name is Victor? was super sweet and very helpful and super cute too. 

I got the crepe with strawberries & nutella and they were amazing. I didn't finish all of it only because I got really full, but other than that it was really cool."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Just eat here. Worst omelette ever,way over cooked. They put cheese slices  lnsted of greated cheddar on it I hate processed American cheese sliceses. Only eat a few bites. Still made me pay for it."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Wish I would have read the reviews but I figured, ""Hey, it's an IHOP, it can't be that bad"". This place is AWFUL! My boyfriend and I walked out a few minutes ago. We sat for a solid 15 mins before someone asked us what we wanted to drink. One of the waiters, a middle aged  Mexican man who I believe might be Carlos from the other reviews, kept staring at us the entire time but refused to come over. He walked by our table multiple times in order to serve the table near us but didn't acknowledge us once. The orange juice was watered down too. After another 15 mins of nothing,he sent a young waiter over to take our order. My boyfriend asked for his eggs fried, to which the waiter replied: ""But how would you like your egg? Scrambled, sunny side up, we fry all eggs"". HUH? After he left it was back to the older waiter staring at us. Our food was taking forever and we felt so uncomfortable that we decided to just leave. Never coming back here again. I would give negative stars if I could. We drove a few miles to the other IHOP on State St. and it was 100x better!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"I do not understand why this app does not allow me to give a place 0 stars, because this IHOP deserves it. The employees are the meanest people, the service is the worse, and the food completely sucks. My pancakes came out raw, and apparently you cannot have bananas on a crepe. Why? Because the server said so. I hate this place. Please, save your time and just go to the In-N-Out across the street. -3 stars"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,I don't ever go to IHOP and the one time I want to give it another chance! 45min of waiting for my family's breakfast and our food wasn't brought out. We left. The waiter tried to come out with our bill charging us for food we didn't even receive. We will not be going here again! Good luck to everyone that does
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"It used to be a favorite for a long time. Seems like IHOP has gotten as expensive as any other luxury restaurant, or they have gotten greedy.  Small 2 ounce cup of salsa wich is normally given for free everywhere else, IHOP now charges you 69 cents for this.  1 serrano Chile which normally cost 2 cents its 70 cents. The food wasnt that great and very simple. If you are going to spend certain amout of money for a dish, might of well treat your self and family to a fine restaurant. This is just my opinion."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Ricardo was amazing! Ihop was so busy the day we came and he was always checking in on us and so attentive! Thanks Ricardo, you deserve a promotion! The food was good too, ihop isn't a four star restaurant but definitely better than dennys."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Today this place was frustratingly slow. We walked in just before 2pm, and didn't leave until 3:10... It wasn't crowded, or anything-which makes the slow service inexplicable . It took a very long time for our food to arrive. My turkey sandwich had lots of turkey on one half and almost none (a hunk about the size of a quarter) on the other. Fries were really greasy (as if there were something wrong with the fryer). Then we were deserted... our server never came back with our bill. We had to walk to the front counter and ask for the bill, which also took a few minutes to arrive. Ultimately a disappointing experience. It will probably be a while before we return."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Went there on March 8th 2014. When we were seated, the hostess did not tell us that anything wasn't available on the menu. After he took our drink order, we waited  about 15 minutes until our order was taken .  I  ordered the chicken fried steak, only to be told they don't carry that anymore. I asked him why the item was still on the menu. He tole me that he didn't have time to cross out the item, from the menus. When I was done, I asked to speak to the manager. I was shocked to learn that he was the acting manager. He told me that the only reason that I wanted to speak to the manager was to get a 20% discount. I spoke to the other waitress, and she informed me that, the just ran out of that entree.

I sent an email to Corporate. I didn't get s response for about a week. I called them back. They stated to me that this rarely happens, and that the franchise manager would be calling me back soon. 

I received a call from the franchise manager the same day. I told him about my unpleasent experience. He said to make things right, He would like to send me a certificate for a free meal at his restaurant. He couldn't make the certificate valid at any other IHOP, because of boundary restrictions. Four days, and still waiting, I have not received my certificate.

Will I visit an IHOP again? Yes. I am just posting this review, to make people aware of the service at this IHOP!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Yum, yum, yum, for a chain restaurant. I love this Ihop. The food is delicious, the servers are kind, and the environment is clean. I have never seen a day where it was not busy, so do expect long wait times and difficult parking. If you are looking for a great meal near the freeway, then I recommend all to stop on by and give this place a try!!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Clean, friendly service, and my meal was on the table in less than ten minutes! Bacon avocado and cheddar omelet with hash browns.  If I'm in the area again I will be back!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Really great service. Pretty quick. They made a few mistakes with our orders, but fixed them quickly when we asked. They were very polite. Would definitely come again!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Worst experience this morning, got their at 11 am put our name in for 4, they said it would take 10 mins, half an hour later we asked when we would be called, seater said oh we called Christy and sat someone who took your name.. but they never called us, we were listening, then they sat us right next to the restrooms, the stench was so bad we had to move, then food took an additional hour to come to us even though we told our waiter we were in a big hurry! Then I received fries  and not hash browns that I asked for  we had to scarf our food down really fast to make our appointment. Just very disappointed!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,it would be perfect if children aren't allowed. screaming kids ruins my day and parents that don't tell their kids to shut up because they're in a public place make me extremely irritable.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"I went to this IHOP for their ""free pancake day"" this year with my two friends. While the pancakes were completely delicious we had to bolt out of the restaurant due to the sheer amount of COCKROACHES around our table!!!! I have never seen roaches literally coming from the ceiling before. My friend was so disgusted she couldn't even eat her food. We ran out of there so fast. Definitely needs a deep clean."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,We came out for a late night dinner. The place wasn't very busy for a Saturday night. The service was good and quick. They asked for our drink orders right away when we sat down. We ordered 2 kids meals and a pecan chicken salad. They were nice to split our salad. The prices were in line with all the other IHOPs be have visited before. The only down side was the smell when they were cleaning the restaurant while we were eating our dinner.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Breakfast time, and what do I feel like? PANCAKES!!

I ordered the amusement park funnel cake thing because of the commercial advertisement, and a breakfast with bacon, pancakes, eggs, side of toast. I shared it with my friend because I'm small and don't eat *that* much. 

I'd say the service was fine, no complaints. The breakfast was as expected, and did not exceed or fall below these expectations.

IHOP is just dandy if you want a good old-fashioned breakfast."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Just want to give a Big Shoutout to Bianca, her customer service was on Point!!! The place was clean and the food was Delicious and Hot!!! Thanks again, and definitely I will be back."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"I was very impressed! As good a breakfast as you can get. Perfect poached eggs( waitress added a third one! ) crispy hash browns, husband loved his poblano omelet, grandson couldn't eat his chocolate pancakes fast enough with extra whipped cream and cherries! No wait, getting there at 8:00 am Saturday morning. Excellent service!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"We decided to go there yesterday just because I was craving breakfast for dinner. The place was pretty empty. That should have been a sign to go someplace else, but we sat down anyway. The waitress comes up and asks what beverages we would like. My boyfriend responds with water, and as I'm about to say what I want, she just walks off. I was kinda annoyed but I let it slide.

We then get the water, order our food, and luckily the food comes quickly. And thankfully I remembered to ask for the sauces I needed because the lady (and I'm using that term loosely) never came back. We had nearly finished our water by the time our food had arrived, so we thought they would refill it. Not to mention, when we were seated at the tabled we saw the canister for coffee, and it had old coffee in it. Plus, my waffles were COLD. 

Never got our second glasses of water. We didn't even get our bill. We had to go to the front and ask for it because the waitress was too busy chatting with her coworkers. I can why people show up at Ihop sh*t-faced. There's no way in hell you can enjoy this place while you're sober."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"One star because of the manager by the name of Carlos. We wanted separate checks since the other couple that joined us arrive late and they were still eating. Carlos then said ""next time you want to pay separately everyone needs to be here ready to pay"". Never heard anyone say that. He was extremely rude. Never going there again!
There's another manager that is there most of the time except that day, he is totally opposite of this guy. Always polite and definitely not rude with demands of everyone to be ready to pay and leave!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,This IHOP does not live up to even average IHOP experience. Felt very rushed with the ordering and payment. Server never checked if food was done ok. Water refills were not provided even though it was not super packed. My seating was near the places they dump dishes and the staff did not care if they were banging the plates forks and knives. Very loud all around and busy feeling on a Saturday morning. This location really lacks service.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"We've stopped at this IHOP on a few occasions when heading up north from LA. It's conveniently located off the 101, easy on and off. Service has always been good and we love the pancakes so no complaints with the food. This morning our server Daniel who was outstanding.  The only negative would be the property could use some updating and the bathroom needs a little work but for food and service excellent this morning, thank you!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"This morning, my husband and I had breaks at IHOP Goleta. We were disappointed with the taste of their pancakes. Even the scrambled eggs were bland. Coffee was not good. All in all breakfast experience was forgettable."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"It's ihop, food is at that par of mediocrity. Not bad, but kinda greasy. What dug into me was the shit service. No fallow up, different folks coming and going with almost every drink or plate. No refills on anything, not even a check, had to run up to the front desk on that myself. Would pass even if starving."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"It's convenient since it's off the 101. The food is always great. But the service isn't great. This past weekend we stopped by and the place was packed. The hostess said there was a wait time and wrote my name on their list. After 10-15 minutes, the hostess seated another party (with the same amount of people as my party) first. When I asked the hostess why they were seated first, her response was she didn't see my name on their notebook. When you could clearly see the name written two parties ahead, of the party what was seated. Luckily, there was a male host who found us a table and seated us right way."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Horrible service, waited for half n hour to be seated and there wasn't even any people in front of me. The manager just kept staring at us and made us wait, as a manager who schedules only two waiters to work when they have the ""short stack of pancakes for $1"""
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Wow.  How do you screw up a finner salad.  Managers response to wilted brown lettuce.   ""Thats how it all is"" 46.00 for two sad dinners.  We could have had a good meal for that.  This location sucks."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Vill man äta amerikanska pannkakor till frukost rekommenderas detta, riktigt amerikanskt och goda pannkakor, bra service,"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Greetings all but especially fellow foodies
Let me start out by saying sometimes being a foodie by being honest and praising and criticizing sometimes we must even though it gives no pressure to do so. 
Soooo let's start with I LUV IHOP! but all IHop's are not created equally. We just came out of this one on calle real in SB Calif. And let me say the ihop in Santa Maria kicks the shyt put of this one. The food is all-out better the service is a lil better but in defense of the service I'm sure they are just as goodI'm just new to them and they new to me. So i will leave the service out and just focus on food. So let get started. 
Portions: the portions in Santa Maria destroy the portions in Santa Barbara.  Advice: i completely understand that there are plenty more reasons for cutting portions thsn just making a few extra bux so please by no means without proof will i say greed is the reason. But don't cut back on patatoes they are 10 lbs for $2. We also ordered oatmeal it was small and came only with a lil brown sugar when i asked for residents i was told oatmeal is not on our menu but it's popular around here so we just giv the basics and that's brown sugar and a side of milk but only wen milk is asked for. I returned it. It wasn't even finished cooking. Which brings me to quality: oatmeal was under cooked and the Toast  had little butter. We also asked for grilled cheese it was crispy so that was good but also had lil butter if any and the cheese was not fully melted. Wen wer ordered it the server said the only grilled cheese we hav is on the kids menu about $5.50 comes with fries.  But since i see there are no kids with you wer will need to surcharge you $1.00 so it will be $6.76 i said ok then wen i saw it i was bummed. I did not return it but wanted to. 
So with tax it was about $73 bux plus $10 tip $83. For the people. Again let mmmme say i don't mind spending i just want to feel satisfied i was not. 
Sorry SB IHOP ON CALLE REAL but you don't make the cut. I will never go there again. 
You know it's bad wen u think wer should hav gone to Costco for hotdogs. 
Thanx to all and if there is anyone from SAnta Barbara who thinks I'm talking shyt put puff my neck please visit the IHOP IN SANTA MARIA."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Worst service and food I've ever experienced at an IHOP. 
Very disappointed the server never even came to see if I needed anything and I had to go to the cashier to request my bill. (Unheard of) could've easily walked out without paying. 
Stay far away!!!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,terrible terrible terrible... if at all possible stay away from this location.... strt with the communication tottaly skipped us after a 30 min wait number was never called. GAL IN THE FRONT HAD SUCH AN ATTITUDE ABOUT IT. then drinks were tottaly wrong as well. and food arrived cold and over cooked. first time in years i go to an ihop and i was remminded on y i stay away and pay a little extra elsewhere. ERIK was the only decent part of the visit exceptional service jst sorry he has to work with such a low quality team.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Dispite seeing bad reviews, I was impressed by this IHOP. On a Saturday morning, I was seated right away, I was served promptly, and received my food in a short amount of time. Parking was plentiful and the staff was friendly.

As for the food, its IHOP. It's as good as what you expect in any. If you like it you like it if you dont you dont."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,We decided to try their happy hour deal the other night. I wasn't expecting it to be anything to great but was pleasantly surprised! I got the chicken sandwich and my husband got the cheeseburger. The onion rings were super crunchy and delicious. My sandwich had a lot of flavor and was very good. I've been here in the past for breakfast and have always had a good food too and prompt/friendly service! Highly recommend coming here!
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Dirty.
Wait staff was slow and had poor attitudes. 
Disappointed to see the management not be able to raise the experience up to the rest of IHOP standards in other locations."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"This place has servrs that arnt happy working there, they take your order like if they hate their job.... never coming here again go to the one on state this one sucks"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"I visited this locatin simply off of convenience to the Santa Barbara airport. The restaurant was indeed the emptiest IHOP I have seen or eaten at. The server was attentive, no issues there; however I would at least expect it with a total of 10 patrons. The restaurant appeared somewhat antiquated, but seemed to be clean or at least tidy. My issue was that on the counter I saw ( numerous times to validate) a roach crawling behind the toasters. Upon leaving the establishment, I did notice that the inspection grade was not clearly displayed in the window, but a notice was in its place stating that it could be provided upon request. Needless to say I won't ever be visiting that IHOP location again."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,Went on a Sunday morning & it wasn't even that packed. Janette was our waitress and super friendly even when we spilled one of our water glasses. She attended us pretty quickly. The Belgian Waffle was really good- light & fluffy. Their bathrooms were pretty clean- one didn't have toilet seat covers though.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,My scrambled eggs were microwaved. Every piece of egg had a thick dark yellow crust on the outside.  I won't be going again.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Terrible service. Marisol took forever to get coffee, never bothered to clean off the sticky syrup on our table before seating us, and managed to screw up my wife's iced coffee order (she ordered black/unsweetened, and got a vanilla). Everything was way overpriced as well. I love IHOP most places I go, but this was just awful. Never coming back to eat here again."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Ive only been to a handful of breakfast themed places and IHOP is a really great place, no matter where I am, whether I'm in LA or Ventura these places have always been nice, there service is great, bathrooms are clean, and their staff is always welcoming! IHOP is a good place for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"My sister and I only came here because we had a gift card. I had the philly cheesesteak and she had the strawberry and banana French toast. I've definitely had better cheesesteak elsewhere. And the French toast was average. I will not go out of my way to come here to eat. On the plus side, our waitress was patient and kind. If it wasn't for the decent service, I'd give this a 1 or 2 stars."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,We went on a Saturday and it was 10:50 pm.  The sign said it closes at 11:00 pm.  We were greeted by a lady and she said we are closed.  We can't seat you but if you would like to order to go she would help us. . We weren't the only ones turned away. We went to Dennys and had a great meal.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Went to this IHOP because it was across the street from where we were staying, it was the first and last time.  The food was okay but the Service was slow and bad! There was a lady at one table and us at another (my mom and I) when we ordered our food.  The place had more people arrive some time later and everyone got their food before us - we didn't order anything difficult.  I had to ask for a refill because the waitress skipped us as she attended everyone else, and when I asked for more napkins besides the one that is wrapped around the fork and knife, she brought us ONE.  I thought this place would be convenient because it was across the street from our hotel but due to the bad service we decided to go elsewhere."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,If u wanna wait an hour for a nice freshly 15$ sliced piece of dogs asshole this is the hot spot!
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Came in for a promo deal that was emailed to me Saturday morning and was refused by the waitress for the deal being Monday-Friday only. Another promo was M-F but the one I had come in for was indeed valid. Got the manager and he quickly approved the promo. ""Over-Medium"" eggs showed up way undercooked with snaggy whites. I ate what I could and when the waitress asked me how everything was, I mentioned the eggs and offered to show her the runny whites. She just apologized and never offer a fix. Hash browns we're tasty however."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"The place was clean, the food good and plentiful and the service was quick and courteous"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Just had a wonderful experience having breakfast for dinner at our local iHop!!

Marco our server was very pleasant and efficient. Brandon the host was super friendly and attentive. 

Compliments to Oti, the genius behind bringing micheladas to the menu!! And shout out to Alfonso for making some delicious pancakes. Best iHop experience ever!!

Thank you!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Best place in town for kids. They really cater to children ... with crayons and coloring placemats, plus a wide children's food menu."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Horrible service. It took a while to get a waiter to our table when we entered. I put my elbow down on the table and realized it was sticky all over. I just asked for iced black coffee ( I had already eaten but my husband wanted to get IHOP) and then received coffee with milk and mocha sweetener. I asked for a new iced coffee which the waitress then forgot to get until she came back to check on us.

Plus all the screaming kids but I can't fault the restaurant for that; just comes with the territory of being a family restaurant. 

Oh and the waitress then proceeded to charge me twice for coffee even though the 2nd time was meant to replace the first order. 

I always go to Cody's, my local favorite, but my husband wanted to check this place out. I definitely won't be coming back again."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"one star because employees were nice 
food was horrid. it's like Denny's. actually denny's is a lot better. over priced bacon and eggs. do yourself a favor and drive into town and spend $3 more home cooked meal."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,Terrible service asked twice for butter and they still forgot. Server was very busy looks like they may be short staffed. We won't be back that's for sure at least not this location.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"What happened to IHOP?!? I went for an early breakfast this morning and ordered the 'Ham Bennie' which looked like a regular eggs benedict. It was $8.99 just for the Bennie. If you want hash browns you have to pay $2.99 more!! And then, the eggs on the Bennie were FRIED not POACHED!!! Who puts fried eggs on eggs benedict?!? The English muffin was rubbery. I had to ask the waiter for a sharper knife and he brings me another butter knife. I was like, duh! I said a sharper knife.  There wasn't much Hollandaise sauce so I asked for a side and it was COLD!! I was so disappointed. I used to like IHOP but I don't think I will ever go back unless there is no other choice."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"Very hospitable. We initially just stopped in to use the restroom to change my 8 week old son, but ended up staying and received great service. My husband ordered a patty melt to go while I changed my son. Ended up deciding we wanted to nurse my son before heading back on the road. They allowed us to choose a table in the back and take the food we originally ordered Togo. No hesitations. Very sweet. Also the patty melt on the Texas toast is delicious! Had to order an Oreo shake for the road and that too was great. Thank you to the pleasant staff."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"First: double-check check HOURS of operation. I've just sent Yelp a pic of their hours... But in case things change...

Second: purely a review on FOOD as I used their online website to order (which was ok, but really sucked (not the locations fault) because I couldn't use the $5 discount due to a glitch in the system... Whatever)).

Food was promptly ready for pickup. Ordered egg-white veggie omellete, hash browns, and chocolate chip pancakes. All were delicious! Food quality and packaging: A+"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"This place is very hidden, and nothing too exciting but I got a birthday stack of pancakes so we went in to redeem them. The pancakes had the familiar IHOP taste, and yes they were good. Surprisingly they actually looked pretty like the staged pictures on the menu, so that's impressive. Nothing to complain about regarding the pancakes.
The service was friendly and kind, but it took a while for us to be welcomed upon entering. The place was dead when we walked in and no waiters were around. Then we didn't get checked on during our meal.
It's actually a pretty spacious interior and I could see it being quite the family place on Sunday. The only other people that were there with us were ordering off the senior menu. That seems to be the crowd here."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,Ordered a turkey bacon club and they served it on a French roll and said this is the new menu. So just to let you know a club now comes on a French roll.
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"FOr an Ihop this is the best of the best. I don't know why it's gotten bad reviews. I mean, it's a house of pancakes, come on.  I've eaten at some very bad diners, ihops, dennys, etc over the years in various cities. For some reason this one is always great. clean, good food. The only kind of downside it's actually kinda funny and not really a bad thing... But I love how all the workers barely speak english yet they all have super white american names like Wilber and Bartholomew and Betsy, etc.  I had to come back and edit this review to say that I haven't eaten there in a few months which is around the time all the bad reviews were written. So maybe it's changed. But it was a very good ihop for a while. I'll try again soon and update."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,Mmm I gave into my cravings once again and visited IHOP tonight. I had been thinking about the Harvest Grain Pancakes and they did not disappoint. The service was also wonderful (I was nervous reading all of the negative reviews about the service). The plate was delivered in a timely manner and the pancakes were nice and hot. Thank you for the nostalgic experience!
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"This  IHOP deserves zero stars. We (interracial family) came in for breakfast and the host says that the wait would be 5-10 mins. Was the place busy? No. We then watch him seat another couple (white) while we continued to wait. The table we were eventually sat at was never even occupied. Strike 1.

Next, the host comes over and asks for our drink order. He takes my wife's drink order and my two kids', then turns and walks away without taking mine. At that point I began to take notice of the situation. My wife is Hispanic and the entire crew of this IHOP was as well. I am the only Black person in the restaurant. When the host comes back with their drinks, he still doesn't ask for my drink order so I told him what I wanted. Apparently he didn't like that. Strike 2.

Instead of returning to the table with my drink, the host turns us over to a different guy. He brings our drinks, takes our food order and leaves. The food comes, we eat, and the waiter never once returns to check on us or to refill drinks. The food was mediocre at best and we'd had enough so I asked the waiter as he walked by for the check. He nodded his head and walked on. He walked by again 5 mins later and when he sees me looking to him for the check, he tells me that someone else will be bringing it to me. After several more minutes, I see him standing behind the line whispering with what appeared to be the manager. They both continued to stare my way. After nearly 15 mins of dealing with this, the waiter finally brings the check. Strike 3. 

I definitely felt that I was being mistreated at this IHOP because of my skin tone. If you don't want me here, then bring me my check when I ask for it. Let me pay and leave. It was just devilish behavior. I will NEVER bring my family to this IHOP again!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Slow service which may have been due to a lack of sufficient wait staff.
The first cup of coffee was not quite up to drinking temperature and I had to actually wave down the waiter to ask for a refill.
The waffles arrived slightly above room temperature... again, I had to wait and wave down a waiter; he took the plate away and a few minutes later returned with another plate with waffles that would not melt the butter. The third plate was a barely warmer but I gave up and ate it anyway."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Never again!! The waiter (in his late 50's) who took our order seemed very irritated that we were even there from the start. Coffee tasted sour and was undrinkable, when I politely asked the irritated waiter for a new coffee, that most likely sealed our fate. Our food never arrived. We noticed two groups of people who got there 20 minutes after we did receive their food which at that point it was 45minutes since we were seated so we asked our waiter for the status of our order, he didn't say one word just nodded his head and walked away. At this point I was about to get up and and leave but my gf and sister convinced me to wait. After another 25 minutes and 3 attempts to wave our waiter down (as he kept avoiding looking our way) we all decided to get up and leave. Boycotting this business from here on and you better believe im spreading the word. 0 out of 5 stars!!!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Placed a very simple order of blueberry pancakes over the phone, they told me they would be ready for a pick up order within 5 minutes. I arrive close to 15 minutes later, took a few minutes to get anyone's attention. When they finally came over to help me, they had not placed my order and told me it would be an additional 7 minute wait. Not an ideal situation for someone on their lunch. Will be awhile before I trust them to have my lunch again. I had been craving IHOP pancakes for sooo long! SUCH a disappointment. They didn't even offer me a coupon."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,"This was by far the best IHOP we have ever been to. The wait staff was incredibly thoughtful and attentive. Food came fast, was tasty, and we never had to ask refills for coffee or orange juice. Great work!"
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"The restaurant was kinda empty and I had to wait 5 mins. Before anyone said hi or asked did I want something to drink. 

The server was just okay. But the Sirloin Steak Tips and mash potatoes with Corn were fabulous!! Really tender and tasty. 

I picked it on a fluke but loved it. I wanted a dessert but the dessert menu was soooo weak that I passed. 

Ok experience though. The dish is what saved it for me."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Horrible service. Waiter was the rudest I've encountered at any restaurant here in SB. Never received food, and ended up leaving. Definitely will not go back."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"Went on my lunch break. (12:30-1:30) got there right at 12:30. It was fairly busy. Three of us got seated by 12:35. Brought our drinks we ordered and an hour later still no food. Asked our waiter how much more time and he cut us off mid sentence and said he would check. He went about what he was doing for the next 5 minutes, never checking. People behind us got seated around 1, and got their food before us. We never got our food and we left at 1:30.
Won't be coming back."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,negative,"IHOP is a chain, so no menu variation. However, this particular location is extra good. I eat lunch here weekly with a largish group (average 8 - 10), which sometimes swells to 14. We always get excellent service. Waiters are almost indulgent-- they allow us to substitute menu items (ie, ingredients in an omlette), share checks or have separate checks, and often they even remember our beverage choices. Food arrives in reasonable time even when they are busy, and bacon ordered crisp arrives crisp. This location's manager seems to hire the most helpful and cheerful staff he can find. For a chain restaurant, this location shines over the other IHOP in town."
T2otvNcawDSkhykOG2tOLA,IHOP,American,positive,Do not believe the 2 stars because the one that should have 2 stars or actually none should be the Carpinteria location . They take for ever to get to you and even then to get the food out! But this location is by far the best! Our boss boy was alfredo and he was fast and our drinks didnt even take 2 minutes when we already had them. Our server was Erick and he was nice as well and food didnt take long 10 minutes and we were already eating all the staff is friendly and with their happy faces on. I have 2 children and I was able to stay and eat because they were fast service and they did not get cranky . I will defenetly be back!
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"Elaine is the best! She helped us with our wedding order, and even went to the extent of taking my call after she left work so I could place my order in time.  During the planning, Elaine gave me honest feedback that I was ordering way too much.  I ended up thinking I knew better :-P and only still ordered more than recommended...and Elaine was right.  We had plenty more than we needed.  BevMo was great to worked with, especially with the perk of them delivering for free on our order."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"After I was introduced to Bevmo in LA, I started coming here whenever I was at home in SB. The staff are really nice and they even offer beer tastings on friday for a $1. It is cool because you can try 6 different kinds of beers and I have actually decided on getting a six pack of the one I had liked the most during those tastings. The selection is decent depending on what you are looking for. I will definitely be back. Thanks Bevmo!"
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"Love it! Even though it's kinda small compared to other Bevmo's, i still love their variety in beer :)

Trying to get the ""Lukcy Bastard"" for my boyfriend, which is a mix of 3 of the Arrogant Bastard beers. 

Also, i love the glassware sets... which they sell ""Das Boot""! super cool."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,THIS STORE FREAKIN ROCKS !!!!! The selection is good and the customer service is amazing !!!! My wife got hooked on a specific beer that they rarely had in stock so after having the employees special order it for her multiple times they just started ordering cases of it on a regular basis to keep it in stock for her.
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"The beer selection is excellent.  However, for me the wine selection really stands out.  They have some great drops in the $10-$20 range, excellent items that I've seen nowhere else.  They post great descriptions that really let you know what they're like, as well.  The workers are friendly without being intrusive as is so often the case with wine merchants.  My favorite place to shop for wine."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,I was staying with folks who prefer to have a healthy liquor cabinet sooo we stopped by here. Lots of choices to be had. They got rye and wines. It was interesting to browse the selections.
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"While this isn't the biggest Bevmo in America, it offers a great selection of domestic and imported beers, wines and spirits. Club cards are free and give you a discount on their already low prices. Plus they have almost every type of alcohol you can think of. They really have everything you need to party."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,negative,"While being rung up the checker sneezed. A very snotty sneezed. Into one hand. That hand wasn't sufficient to catch all the snot so he tried his wrist, then other hand to collect it all from his upper lip. Then continued to punch the order and ask if we wanted a receipt. With snot still all over his hands. Only recommend if you're in the mood to dry heave."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"I love coming here for all of my alcoholic needs! They have a wide selection of beers, wines, and liquors. If you want it, chances are they have it!

They even have a selection of meats and cheeses and even caviar. Delicious!

Bevmo also offers wine tasting classes.  Take a look around, they will definitely have something that will tickle your fancy. Not sure what to get? They have various sizes of bottles, from the mini, one shot bottles, to a big 1.75 liter bottles and a few sizes in between depending on the brand.

Not in the mood for something alcoholic? They have s selection of non-alcohlic beverages. So, there really is something for everyone! Come on in, they will surely have something that will tickle your fancy.

Their staff is friendly and helpful. And become a Bevmo card member, it's free and the savings will make you come back for more! Best deals around town!

21 and up only, unless accompanied with an adult or guardian."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,negative,"Although, the lady in charge was nice and sweet, Adam has horrible service which is why I gave 1 star. Not very helpful at all, questioning the price of the items in the store as if I was lying, boxed my own items because I felt like he didn't want to, I should've just rung myself up to relieve him of his misery"
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"BevMo is such a great place! 

Always spacious and well stocked, this was one of the places that I missed when I lived on the East Coast. The location is pretty ideal as it is right next to Costco, so when it's time to party, people can hit both places in one fell swoop. 

This is one of the bigger stores that I have visited and they had a whole wall dedicated to bigger packs of beer, just in time for Labor Day! The store has a great variety of local beers and wines as well as other items that can be more difficult to come by. As a temporary resident of Boston, I discovered a few local items out there that I can usually find in BevMo, so that makes me more adventurous when trying out some of the other stuff that they have that I have not seen before. It's pretty amazing how much they offer and are still able to keep the aisles clean and clear.

Not to mention their great sales. If you have EVER heard of this place, you know about their 5 cent wine sales. (A-MAZ-ING!) I've discovered some really amazing ones from this sale, not only because of the displays that offer scoring information, but also from some of their employees. They also offer a guarantee. If you don't like one of them, they let you return it! (Isn't that INSANE?!) I haven't had to do that, but I overheard a sales associate tell another customer in a different store once.  That, in my mind, puts them up there with Nordy's for customer service. They also have their own customer card that allows you to earn points for future discounts. They also have other good sales on their products, as well 
They were fully staffed to handle the crowd and everyone was friendly and helpful. 

Their grand opening features several tastings from local brewers and is an entire weekend event.  It was well organized, especially since they were giving away $25 gift cards to their first 500 patrons (over 21, of course), with lines extending far into the next parking lot. To add to the fanfare, they had about 12 employees applauding and cheering as we entered the store. 

Can't wait to go back and go to some tastings!"
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"Do yourself a favor, get a FREE club card so you get to save on expensive alcohol. It's quick and easy. I find that with the card it's cheaper than albertsons which is down the street and definitely cheaper than any alcohol you'll find in IV. 

Staff is helpful so don't be shy to ask them about anything.The 5th star for me is the Wine selection. Oh yeah. Good wine at good prices."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,negative,"OK. I spend over $80, buying seven six-packs and two four-packs of beer, and you don't tell me until I've already paid for it and can't return it that ""Corporate doesn't send us enough boxes."" So, I've got to make five trips from the garage and up the stairs because you guys are too cheap to buy boxes??? I get it why the biggest chain in town gets an average of only two stars."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,negative,"A friend and I were finished shopping at Home Depot nearby and I swung by to get some beer for my parents for dinner. After making my selection and walking to the counter, I pulled out my ID and BevMo card to give to the cashier. The cashier then proceeded to ignore me and ask my friend for his ID. We are both well above 21, and he definitely looks like it. It turns out that my friend forgot his wallet, and thus no ID. Apparently this was a problem for the cashier, who smugly informed me we were not welcome in the store, despite my friend never attempting to make a purchase. I tried to discuss the situation with him, but frustratingly he had already profiled us in his head as underage kids (because teenagers LOVE to get drunk off of craft beer /s). I try to have patience and understand corporate policies, but at no point did I believe that this cashier had any desire to help me make a purchase. I asked him what I was to do in that situation, when he rudely said that he was already being nice by not kicking us out earlier. He did not offer any apology, any solution, any suggestion on how I might avoid this situation in the future or anything but a prompt instruction to leave. I'm still a little baffled at the whole situation, because all I can think is that if my friend had never entered we would've been fine, but because of an honest mistake on his part I was made to feel insulted by the cashier. If anyone actually reads this be very careful shopping at the Goleta BevMo, one of the dudes working is a major narc."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"Cashier on duty was super vigilant about keeping masks on which could be viewed many ways.  Found the wine selection to be pretty limited, bit they did have a rarer Amarone della Valpolicella wine from Italy.  We eventually won the girl over at the end when my dad tipped her for keeping us COVID safe -- this location was semi #declawed on cold White Claw, but they did have plenty on the back wall.  One of the smallest BEVMO's I've ever visited."
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,They have kirsch and 18-year-old Nicaraguan rum. Staff were super helpful and knowledgeable.
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"Can't find a specific type of spirit for that recipe or cocktail? Bevmo probably carries it. 

I'm consistently in awe over just how much of a selection this place offers. It's very reminiscent of an ABC liquor store on the East coast where you feel as though you're in the king of them all. 

This location is typically clean and quiet, with a good number of staff present. They are happy to recommend items for you if you're on your way to an event or are in the market for a gift. 

I'd recommend acquiring one of their frequent customer cards (which pair with your phone number, too). With the card, you'll be eligible for some awesome discounts. I love their penny wine sale, among other amazing members-only perks!

Give this spot a try!"
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"This BevMo location is great! I love the selection of beers they have- I was able to try a Canadian beer called the Salty Scot (which I would recommend to all beer lovers). I feel like the prices here are reasonable, and the employee service here is wonderful. Will come back to stock up for any future event!"
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,positive,"My friend and I went into what we thought was going to be a normal day pop bad decisions. But what came next was heart warming and comforting. We go in looking for some cheap shot glasses and as we make our selection, this sweet lady approaches us and tells us how they had JUST restocked that type of shot glass a couple minutes prior. As we go about making our bad decisions(purchases) we finally arrive to the counter she is at in order to asses our economic damages. She compliments my Gizmo shirt because she so happened to name her dog after Gizmo!! The other two dogs are Elvis and I cannot remember the other dogs name. She was so nice, we wished we could have boughten more alcohol, but our budgets did not permit us since we have a formal to attend on Saturday and we have to go get haircuts as well! However, we do believe she deserves a raise because of her impeccable customer service and attention to detail!"
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,negative,"That fact that you guys provide great service and sell many unique items, it disappoints me to find out you don't guarantee any product you sell. I've bought 2 unique lighters for Christmas, which I kept one. It stopped working 3days ago, I know I missed up by not keeping the receipt for it, but at least you could have made an exception. It's a less than $10 item. 
Very disappointed. 
I only gave you 3 starts, just because you have a 5 starts costumer service, yet the guarantee on your items sadden me!!"
n_fADQa8T0dgLd-D8ABEhQ,Bevmo,American,negative,"This place is a rip off. 

Their 5 cent wine ""deals"" are a scam. Wines that cost 6 dollars everywhere else they charge 20 dollars for then 5 cents for the second bottle. That's still way more expensive than if you bought it somewhere else. 

Albertson's, Vons and Ralph's all have better deals when you buy six bottles. 

A bottle of Chandon costs 11.99 at Costco, 15.99 at Bevmo. 

Do yourself a favor, if you're buying wine or champagne go to Costco or one of the big supermarkets for 6."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This place rocks. You'd never guess it from the outside, but the food is great.  Great with kids too. We ALWAYS grab brunch and a beer when vacationing in town.  My only suggestion is they have 6 beers taps with only 3 beers running.  Fix that please!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"A couple of Saturdays ago, we went to Farmers for breakfast. I ordered the mini-waffle plate...
after waiting for quite some time and noticed other diners were receiving their orders after we
we had placed our orders first...I asked our waitress, why we were not getting our orders, and she said, ""Shortly"".  Finally, we received our orders and I asked if they had sugar-free syrup and she said, ""No, we don't have it""...then I asked the manager(?) why they don't have sugar-free syrup,and he said, Yes, we do have it"" and brought it promptly....I told him to inform their staff of this product.  I found my waffle very thin and tasteless...not, like the old Farmer Boy restaurant.
I also asked why our orders were so delayed and the manager(?) said that they were working
on the waffle maker and were also working on the kitchen systems as well...Well, you would think they would have  work out these  problems before opening a restaurant and they have been in this business for many years.  We will not be returning, though I was comp for my
meal only."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"My brother is getting married today, so our family of 5 came in for a big breakfast. The wait staff was extremely pleasant and our waitress even dropped off a complementary cinnamon roll to the table in honor of my brother's big day! The omelets were well portioned, the eggs Benedict was delicious, and the breakfast burrito was big enough for two! I highly recommend this diner!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Good breakfast. Pancakes were nice and fluffy. Cinnamon roll was awesome. 

Denver omlette was ok. Hashbrowns we're just ok, as well. 

Stick to the carbs here!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Got the Santa Barbara Local omelette with hashbrowns and toast and it was damn good. I did ask for extra salsa, which definitely heightened the experience. Portions are massive and I got a huge dollop of butter that I didn't even come close to finishing. Overall a cool spot with a comfy local vibe. These are the kinds of places where you find the best breakfast!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This morning we all decided to eat at farmer boys!
This was the best choice of our entire trip.
First of all breakfast is my favorite meal, it's early your hungry and someone can make or break your day!
The coffee was strong but not overly strong. And every one ordered omelette with  a different spin to it. With biscuits and bread, omg the biscuits were to die for. We will sure be back for the delicious food and friendly service."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,The food and service are absolutely fantastic. Definitely a good combo of Diner/California cuisine. Whether its 7am or 2pm its a must.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"The place is totally remodeled and very nice and clean.  The food (both times we ate there) was excellent.  It is sometimes difficult to find a decent breakfast place, but we definitely struck gold with this place.  In fact, I would have to say I had the best lox bagel I've ever eaten.  We enjoyed the the place so much the 1st time, that we decided to travel 12 miles out of our way to go a second day."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This isn't the old Farmer Boy..unfortunately.  Glad to see it reopen but disappointed that many of the old standards are missing. No more corn beef hash, chicken fried steak, breakfast barrito to name a few. 
The remodel was greatly needed and is well done, but for some reason, it is so noisy inside you can't wait to leave. Perhaps a ploy to turn tables faster. 
Food was good if a little rushed and service will get better in time. But will it be the same neighborhood place it once was, I doubt it. Too expensive"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,This has rapidly become our new favorite breakfast spot. The food is fantastic and the service is always friendly and cheerful. Everything we have had here is phenomenal. All homemade and delicious. The chilaquiles were a new find today and wow!  Amazing flavors with a slight spicy kick. Brophy's definitely hit it out of the park with this place!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Since I travel so much for my job. I have he rare opportunity to eat at so many different places. I chanced on this place. Parking isn't exactly the easiest. But where in Santa Barbara is easy for parking?! This place makes that all go away. Service is outstanding. I accidentally left my CC there for a week. They remembered who I was, and had it waiting for me. This just doesn't happen in today's service related establishments. I've since taken family and friends to experience this first hand. Funny that I haven't got to the best part. Their food is off the charts. I frequent this place for breakfast while I'm working in the city. I've had lunch here a couple times. Same as B-fast. Doesn't disappoint. Highly recommend the Santa Barbara local omelette, add try-tip. A lot of food but you have to try it. I could go on and on. One last thing. One of the waiters there asked me my name after my second visit. Several weeks later, ran into him. Remembered my name. Just great food with sincere friendly service."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Food was phenomenal... Definitely get the biscuits and sausage gravy... Carnitas Chilaquiles is a must have!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I ate at Farmer Boy this morn - use to come here many many years ago and loved it back then so decided to stop in again as I was in town for Fiesta.

Breakfast was deeeelicious! Eggs and potatoes and bacon was all quality and not greasy like other places can be...It still has a great small town diner feel that has been updated...  Booth seat was comfortable and wait staff were all very friendly and accommodating... It's not a huge space but has tables, booths and a counter.  Cost was average."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Wonderful food, good coffee, and hash browns to die for. Will definitely eat here again when we are in town."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Good eats!  Great service!! The crab cake eggs Benedict were amazing!!!  I also had the carnitas chilaquiles-- equally awesome!  

Modest Mouse show last night was super; but this place for breakfast.... not sure which I enjoyed more!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,Great breakfast options and the ambiance is casual and fun. We had the Santa Barbara omelette and the ingredients were fresh. English muffin was not warm or toasted enough but everything else was good.  Coffee was great!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I  had a nice lunch with friends and family last weekend.   I'm on a special diet and i appreciate that they were quick to accommodate my dietary requests.
I love their new clean look and I look forward to coming back and trying out some of their new tasty looking dishes."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Typically this place has great service. But today with a party of five and the place not that busy the servers were not at their best. They didn't get us a chair for the 5th member of our group, not enough silverware and napkins were provided. No one asked during our meal if we had everything we needed. Bussed a dish without asking if she was done eating and didn't ask if we needed anything else like dessert at the end of our meal. Food was good, service was terrible."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I've been very much looking forward to the re-opening of Farmer Boy (knowing how much I like the other restaurants which are owned by the new owners) but after my visit this morning it was unfortunately a great disappointment.  Our waitress while she was very friendly I could tell she was overloaded with tables but the really nice and helpful hostess stepped up to help with coffee and water refills, etc.  The main thing that will keep me from going back is the bad acoustics.  We sat in the back room and in order to hear or be heard one would have to speak in an extremely loud voice.  I'm writing this review in hopes the owners will do something to fix this problem."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Absolutely the best iced tea in Santa Barbara.  Who gave people the idea that candle-flavored iced tea was a good idea?  Good iced tea is important and Farmer Boy has the best.  They are using Green Star Organic Black Tea with filtered water and the tea is fantastic.  None better in Santa Barbara where iced tea is usually pitiful.  Besides great tea, the food is really good, quality ingredients.  Great service and clean, inviting interior.  A little bit nostalgic with some nice updates.  Best of all, they serve breakfast all day and they are open for dinner.  Not just a lunch place!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"If you like hearty diner food, this is the place to go. They have large portions, pretty much any breakfast food you want and absolutely delicious cinnamon buns. I had the 2 eyed toad in the hole sandwich, more complicated than it sounds. It's basically a sourdough sandwich with cheese, tomato, bacon and an over easy egg. It was a decent sandwich but the star was easily the home fries. They were whole potatoes and oh so crispy! Decent prices too. Check them out if you're looking for a homestyle breakfast or lunch!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"The same old sign is out front but trust me, it's not the same old Farmer Boy that I remember. Sure a couple of the old servers were here but that's all I recognized.

Gone are the daily specials, the Obama burger, chicken fried steak and so many other things. 

The decor now is industrial chic but they did keep the mid century lighting and the ketchup wall is truly mesmerizing.

Gone are the reasonable prices and Ralph's easy going attitude. I guess I won't be seeing any more two for one coupons in my mail box either from the new and ""improved"" "" Farmer Boy"".

They should have at least kept the well seasoned griddle as that added so much goodness to their food.

I had one of the few options on the menu for a late breakfast, the Santa Barbara omelet. The taters were real good, omelet was small with very little bacon. Portions are smaller, prices are higher. Service was very nice and the place is clean.

It's a sad weekend for me, Basa served at their place on the breakwater and now this?"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"My boyfriend and i ate here this past Sunday on a whim. We had to pick up a stolen surfboard in Isla Vista lol and then we were hungry. I saw it from the car and we went in. A little dark and sterile for my visual taste but the hostess was a doll so we stayed. A nice guy outside told us it was definitely worth waiting for...he did not lie! Wow one of the best breakfast ever. We go to different restaurants every Sunday for breakfast...it's our thing. This was memorable as was our service...Awesome chick and she was hustling for all the tables in the back room. Super friendly and accommodating,
I had an egg white omelette with mozzarella, avocado and mushroom...perfection and I am soooo picky. I ordered the home fries and they were the best...nice chunks of potato and freshly chopped...no frozen here. The english muffin tasted homemade. We always share pancakes, french toast or a waffle on Sundays but this Sunday we shared their cinnamon roll...Heaven in your mouth...seriously perfect. Not dry, not too doughy, not cinnabbon sweet where you think your teeth might instantly fall out. 
Also the coffee is so good. Not watered down diner coffee and not too strong.
All around it was a perfect breakfast. Wish I could remember our waitresses name!
My only tip...maybe cozy up the joint a little. Thanks, we will be back!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"The newly transformed Farmers Boy cafe on upper State near the PO is outstanding. Clean diner vibe, friendly staff & the best fish & chips I've had outside of New England! Crisp, batter, light perfectly cooked fish, not greasy at all. Fries were real potatoes & also nicely golden. Coleslaw was creamy & fresh. Good prices & I've heard they gave a happy hour & great breakfasts too. Enjoy !"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,What an improvement from the former Farmer Boy. One of the best burger and fries I've ever had.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I really want to like this place and when I went within two weeks of it opening I had a fabulous breakfast. Since then it has been anything but fabulous. My main complain is the potatoes which seem to come out cold and/or soggy now. In those first weeks they were hot and crispy but yet still fluffy and moist on the inside. My other issue is they offer all their omelettes as scrambles, but almost always when I order a scramble it comes out as an omelette. Since it appears incorrect on the receipt, I expect this is an issue with the server inputting it incorrectly. I may try it again in the coming months because it has the potential to fill a niche missing in Santa Barbara."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Wir waren zum Mittagessen dort, das Service war super, die Bedienung war sehr freundlich. Wir alle, insgesamt vier Personen, waren allesamt mit unserem Essen zufrieden. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis war super. Von der Einrichtung her ist es alles etwas einfacher gehalten, was uns aber nicht gestört hat. Wir haben als zufriedene Gäste das Lokal verlassen."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Iiiiits back!  Nice reincarnation.  Kept the name...new menu.  A fantastic new cinnamon roll.  Fresh, quality ingredients makes for tasty breakfast.  Had Italian sausage scramble with home fries which were cooked crispy round the edges and good seasoning like they should be and which almost no place does.  Great new look and feel with top notch friendly manager and wait staff.  Friend who has demanding palate had the fresh salmon burger and raved on it.  Have pies!  Cant wait to work through those and rest of menu.  Not 5 star yet cuz limited menu tasting so far.  Crowded this first week due to pent up neighborhood demand.  Guess everybody's glad it has been resurrected.  Up, happy vibe."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Bomb ass food. Santa Barbara prices. Seriously, get their blackened chicken wrap. You will NOT be disappointed. I have literally dreamed about having it. It's got an old school diner feel, but it's clean and more expensive. Not really a complaint though, the dishes are large and really good. Only recommendation is- if you get a slice of pie, ask them to warm it pretty well. (my friend got a slice and it was still cold in the middle) I got a sundae. I don't think its possible to mess up a sundae, so I'm not reviewing for their ice cream presentation, but it was definitely delicious! Give it a shot. I hear they're open later and have dinner options now."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Very happy to see the Farmer Boy open again. We had a very good  breakfast there today. Very good service for second day open.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"It tastes like Denny's who cares if it looks like a old diner. Minute Maid orange juice was lacking for an ""all fresh"" restaurant. We went for breakfast and the service was fine. I will admit it looks good, but food takes the most important spot"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,First time back since they re-opened. Service is more efficient and the food was excellent! I got a veggie scramble and my husband got chicken and waffles that was to die for. We will come back...most likely for a chocolate shake (which we didn't leave room for).
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Great Food, Exceptional Service! Good job new Farmer Boy! When we arrived, we were immediately greeted at the door and given our choice of seating. They've added more tables, extended the bar counter, removed all the clutter from the old place, and it is much lighter, cleaner and nicer inside. A+ for service as we were waited on immediately and served our food within 15 minutes. Food is higher quality and fresher than the old Farmer Boy- no more bacon drowning in grease or soggy toast. Omelettes are really good and you can tell they use fresh ingredients. Prices are totally reasonable and in-line with most places and even slightly cheaper than many other breakfast places in town. The most notable difference is the staff- friendly, smiling, and attentive as opposed to the old staff who rarely smiled, took forever to serve you and almost never checked to make sure your meal was okay or whether you needed anything else. This is a great place and we will be back again!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"No bad considering where they were few years back. The cinnamon roll is a must and was amazing. The prices are not a good comparison to the rest of the food. The only juice on the menu is ""orange juice"" nothing else, I thought it was weird.  And the glass of juice was $6!! I asked for hot salsa but they didn't have anything, about 5 minutes later the waitress brought a ""special order"" of salsa that the Mexican chef and made for me.  No bad for something that was whipped up in a jiffy. My kids enjoyed it but I wasn't impressed with the ""Santa Barbara Local omelette. Bacon pieces were completely burnt and made the omelette bitter."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Chose the chicken, biscuits and gravy. Highly recommend. Great ambiance, server was awesome and friendly, and they had Johnny Cash playing in the background. They seemed to know the locals pretty well which is always cool too. Great place."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I really like how they renovated this place. It's very clean and pleasant, but almost a little sterile. The ingredients seemed pretty fresh for a diner, which was great."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"If you're on a diet no worries. If not, they'll put you on one nevertheless. Small food portions. Ordered French Toast and I got 3 measley slices of bread (I wished I took a picture!) They were stingy on their syrup as well. Served in small plastic containers. Only reason I went for the comfort food was because they didnt have Corned Beef Hash on the menu. What kind of American eatery is that??  Go to Joe's Cafe. More food for your $.  Advice to new owners: redo your deco. Makes no sense. This aint LA."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Howdy y'all. Farmer boy? More like farmer man. This place is no joke. The chicken and waffles was delicious- at first glance I was sad I didn't add the additional 2 chicken strips but the meal was so filling I couldn't even finish it. If your looking to higher your cholesterol try the chicken fried steak- seriously though it was one of the best I've ever had and cooked perfectly. Worth your doctors disapproval. The hash browns- extra crispy are also contributing to the 5 star brunch win. 
Lunch is great at Farmer Man too (i renamed it) farmer hamburger and blt were piled high and tasty. Patty melt was my least favorite dish but honestly still really good. Pretty cool with sandwiches you can do half salad half fries for all you indecisive folk. 
Obvi get a fresh squeezed oj mimosa. 
Y'all come back now ya hear."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Not sure why they kept the Farmer Boy name since they dropped many of the best menu items as well as all of the charm. Only the very popular cinnamon rolls have been retained from the original menu and local favorites like the local favorite Huevos Rancheros with Ralph's beans are gone, replaced with wannabe hipster items like chicken and waffles, a food of the moment which is being dropped by the truly trendy eateries as passe. 

The gravy on my chicken and biscuits was not very warm and the chicken was tender but very heavy. Service was so-so, prices have risen considerably and while the restaurant is certainly cleaner it is neither different enough to be a new look nor a good tribute to the landmark it replaces. While the designers retained the basic floor plan and kept the chandeliers the result is uninteresting and bland. Bathrooms are a huge improvement and each contains a large photo of the Farmer Boy circa 1950.

As long time patrons of the Farmer Boy we were so excited to see it open again after a very long remodel but seriously disappointed in both the space and the food and found the service just barely adequate."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Best breakfast in Santa Barbara!  Home cooked food, great service all at a good price.  My new favorite."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,been back a few times since my last review and I retract my statement about it not being cozy...it was cold my first time there...now it feels totally cozy to me. If I lived in SB they would know my name lol luckily for my booty I live in L.A or I'd be in cinnamon bun rehab!!! Love this place...so consistent...going in a few weeks for Boyfriend's Bday...we crave their food! Thanks Farmer Boy!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Excellent diner food. we had a great breakfast, super friendly service, and later on the manager was extra helpful after I left my credit card behind. The hash browns are awesome!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Had breakfast with the hubs there this morning food was delicious can't believed I've never been here before....will def be back!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Ummmmmm why in the world did I not discover this place sooner. Must have drove by a 100 times and never went in. Finally checked it out and now it's a family favorite. I always get a burger and the GIANT buffalo wings. Huge portions and it barely cost more than fast food.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"What happened to the service?  
I was at the bar for about 5 minutes then a waitress took an order next to me then started small talk with the group after she put the order in.  

The only acknowledgment from the staff was a smile from another waitress walking by me.  

I'm writing this as I wait for my order.  I may change the star rating if the food is good."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I was ready for change as new owner and new remodel.  Decided late breakfast on a Saturday morning was ideal. Arrived at 11:15am for breakfast, well they stop serving breakfast at 11:00am.  I do not eat meat so lunch is never a great option in any restaurant.  My choices are  salmon salad or a veggie burger, ugghhhh.  i will eat seafood in a pinch. Tried the sesame Salmon salad.  It was boring and sad.  Vegetarians beware at lunch.  The diner is only open till 3pm. They really should offer breakfast on a Saturday morning until the AM is over."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Amazing is all I can say the fried chicken is great the meatloaf is amazing you have to go to this institution .
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I ate here once years ago and then never again, as the food was greasy and mediocre at best.  I never understood why the place was so popular, except for maybe the low prices.  I'd been hearing that it was under new ownership for the past couple of years, and was recently talked into going there for breakfast with a friend.  Wow...the food is WAY better now.  I love eggs, and they have some pretty tasty egg dishes.  Apparently the new owners brought in a professional, high-end chef from L.A. to create their menu and train their cooks, as told to me by one of the servers.  And it's still reasonably priced."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I grew up coming here, but haven't frequented in many years. We decided to give this restaurant a try this morning, it was great. The service from, Keisha (apology if I spelled that incorrectly!) was exceptional. My partner and I have both worked in customer service for many many years and it is rare to find a server who meets all of the criteria that makes your experience truly memorable. We had issues with our meal, but she went out of her way to not only fix our meal but added to it. She made us feel at home and we will definitely come back. Our food once fixed, was delicious!! Great food, and Exceptional service."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Nicely updated from its previous condition. Breakfast all day! Burgers, salads, soup, sandwiches, and pies!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Very good breakfast, at a reasonable price. Very friendly staff, but parking can be a challenge."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"The service was shameful. Our waitress spent most of the time talking to one party, which seemed to be staff not on the clock. Our food sat getting cold for far too long. The chef had to finally bang something to get the waitress' attention. She didn't start making my wife's cappuccino until after our food came and I had to remind her. Only the chef and busboy seemed to care. 

After five minutes of trying to get eye contact with what seems like the manager on duty and our waitress, I had to flag down one of the other waitresses so I could pay the bill and leave. 

Really disappointed our Sunday brunch turned out to be so frustrating!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I really enjoyed it. Service was delightful. The staff greeted and took great care of me the second I walked into the restaurant. There is no other place like it. The classic 50s Santa Barbara diner, just a great little spot for a family meal."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Great fresh food , pie , and amazing service and coffee. Love that they remember your birthday and send you a coupon for a free slice of pie. Free internet also"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"The first visit my wife and I enjoyed our meals. On this last visit we were so disappointed we agreed we would not be back. 

To start with neither of us eat potatoes and when we asked for a substitute of fruit or tomato we were informed it would be $3.50 additional for the substitution. Something places like Sambos and others do for no charge.

We had scrambles and when we got our meals the eggs were grayish like the flattop hadn't been cleaned all morning. 

Farmer Boy had been a regular place prior to the ownership change and now it looks like it's not! :("
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Understaffed. Took ages before we got our food. The lady, who was really nice, had to serve the entire restaurant alone. On the pricey side too."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This place was amazing prior to the ownership change and redevelopment. This is nothing like the previous farmer boys and should be avoided. To start off, The waitress was extremely rude, maybe she was hungover or angry about something else but it shouldn't be placed on the customers. The menu is extremely scaled back for a breakfast place with limited options to choose and even fewer beverages. Orange juice water coffee soda. No apple juice none of the blueberry tea or pomegranate drink the previous farmer boys had. In addition the food was brought out incomplete without the hshbrowns and the toast was burnt. I mentioned this to the waitress and she laughed and said I should have ordered what my friend got. 
All and all this place is a disappointment other than the new chairs and countertop the decorations inside are tacky and loses any authentic feel. It's a shame to see a place which such character be changed to something rather dull and unappealing. Save yourself go elsewhere"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I have breakfast here pretty often, this morning was not the norm.... Met my girlfriend for a quick breakie, sat in the first booth, I would not recommend on sitting their the fruit flies are pretty bad at that table..  My friend arrived before I and had her beverage, no one came to the table to offer a beverage not even a bus boy. I finally got the attention of manager. This was a first for me, I had to wave my arms in the air and said "" excuse me may I have some coffee?""  That's a first for me in any restaurant. I love the farmer boy restaurant but was very surprised at service and cleanliness. I will be back."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Great food. Enormous wings and delicious beer. Inexpensive and Nick our server was fantastic.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Great for what it is. Nothing fancy diner style meal.   My friends and I sat at the bar each ordered something different. The cinnamon rolls are as big as your head and a must try!  The server was very friendly and easy going. Nice to chat with and attentive.  The omelettes were good-not the most flavorful but add some salt and you fine.  It was quick service for the food.  Good coffee and free refills! For a casual breakfast in Santa Barbara try this place out next.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Had the breakfast sandwich 2 eyed toad in the hole. Quite creative and tasty. The atmosphere is great with barstools and booths. We took grandma out to eat for her birthday breakfast. They make the best crispy hash browns. The coffee is good too. The service is wonderful and the staff was on top of it. Another great outing.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,The pancakes and waffles were the best part of the meal!  The manager or owner was very personable and made a point to visit throughout and noticed we had not eaten and asked if everything was okay...very attentive.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Its nothing like the old farmerboy. The family feeling is gone the picture on the walls gone the old menu gone
They need to rename it because its false advertising hope you know what you're doing. It had a lot of dedicated customers or as we would say in the restaurant business usual people that come all the time for the good food and atmosphere"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Good food and plentiful portions. Friendly staff and quick service! For basic breakfast fare it is great!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Easily one of the best breakfast joints in SB. See Carolyn's review.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/farmer-boy-santa-barbara-2?hrid=H5WyNFYWhXronUMIIp5n0w&utm_source=oshare&ref=yelp-android

Love this place. Great staff and service. Food is always good and consistent. Plus it is a little off the beaten path so less crowded and more accessible.

Obsessed with the cinammon roll the size of your head. Biscuits are fresh and crumbly!!

Best dish has to be the chicken biscuits and gravy, or chicken and waffles.

This place has really cleaned up with new ownership!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Best breakfast ever! My boyfriend Chris and I had such a fantastic meal! Mike was our server and suggested the Carnitas Chilaquiles, which I ordered and Chris ordered waffle combo and we split the orders so we would each have something sweet and savory. Mike was right! Good stuff. 

Since my original review we've made it a regular breakfast stop after church. It's become our thing...this time had Eddie's biscuits and gravy with two scrambled eggs...delish! Biscuits were AH MAZING!!! Buttery and just the right amount of flakiness to it. Gravy was on point! So we ended up also putting honey on a little portion of the biscuit that didn't have gravy on it...oh goodness! Talk about satisfying!  : ) Chris and I will see you next Sunday! Oh and we make it a habit to sit at Mike's section bc he is just that awesome! Super friendly and personable!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"We've been in twice since they reopened. They still have a lot of service issues to work out. The couple who sat down at the same time as us still hadn't received their meals when we were finished and paying for ours. 
The food was decent. I had the 2 Eyed Toad-in-a-hole sandwich the first visit and just basic bacon & eggs on my second visit. My ""soft"" poached eggs were overcooked & completely solid.
I also had the $6 cinnamon roll. It was pretty on par with the cinnamon roll that I remembered from Farmer Boy of past, but since I was hoping they would improve on the original I was a little disappointed. It was still too sweet and baked too long.  
We'll keep going back because there aren't all that many breakfast spots in SB and hopefully they'll work out their service kinks given more time."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"We had several good breakfasts immediately after opening, but today the food was cold and this is the tomato that was in my toad-in-hole sandwich!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"In town for work, my crew and I saw this place across from our hotel. I looked them up on here and it misleadingly says they close @ 3. Lucky for us they don't close til 9! When we arrived we were greeted and told to sit wherever we wanted, having 5 guys we decided to sit at the counter. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. You can tell by talking to her that she takes pride in where she works. I ordered the Farmer Boy Burger which is a bacon cheese burger with pepper jack and an Anaheim chili. It was delicious, warm, juicy, and full of flavor. My only complaint, thinking back, is that the menu said the bun was toasted but it wasn't.  We also tried the buffalo wings. Honestly, they were the best I've ever had. Very crunchy, warm, and delicious. I would highly recommend. I will be back for sure!!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Nice waitress, the food is good for diner food.  Has that 50's diner decor with a modern twist. Pretty reasonable."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Just okay given the amount, quality, and quantity of food. I judge a breakfast place by two things.. right?  Coffee and ""X"". My ""X"" is the pancake. This pancake wasn't my type, too thick and syrup wasn't warm. But the coffee was delicious and kept flowing. Ordered hash browns well done - no, not even the second time. Sausage links were good. Its okay. There are better places but maybe they will work the kinks out. This review is from early December on a  weekday"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted with very welcoming faces and good mornings! I love the modernized diner decor! It's so clean and chic at the same time. Service was great. My boyfriend and I split the country sausage omelette, the classic waffle, and a large orange juice. Food was hearty and delicious we couldn't even finish it! Will definitely recommend this place and will come back! We sat at the counter but had to take a picture with the wall of ketchup bottles and the booth."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Went to breakfast june 17 first time back since the remodeling. It is nicer looking with retro style metal behind counter and cute neon sign. Nice pictures on the wall but food disappointed. Had French toast that was just ok. A scramble was the choice of the other person. He complained that the hash browns were just like steamed soft potatoes. 
Pricing on the menu was good but the food was barely adequate. 
Cute waitstaff were more interested in a single gentleman at the counter than other customers. 
Sorry but I don't think we will go back."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Best eggs Benedict I've had and that's my go to breakfast dish. Make sure to swap out the English muffin for their amazing biscuit. Awesome service... don't let the shopping plaza spot fool you.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,I had crab cake Benedict and it was delicious and their carnitas chilaquiles is so good!!!! Good service too and friendly.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Very disappointingwe have gone there since they had to remodel, but now they've changed the menu so I try their chicken fried sliders and they were horrible they must have use the grease from the chicken to try to make the gravy, it was disgusting I couldn't even eat it! and no more omelettes at all we won't be going back"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"So disappointed. This used to be a favorite breakfast spot, but the past two times have been bad experiences, especially with the service. Today my boyfriend and I left feeling really dissatisfied. Our server (unknowingly?) splattered coffee all around the cups when refilling and didn't bother to clean it up. We were also rushed to close out our tab (for no valid or explained reason) when we were still drinking our coffee, there was no one waiting for a table, and seemingly not that busy at the time. The portions of food seem smaller now as well. We had many positive visits here in the past that kept us going back, but not sure if we'll return again."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I've eaten at Farmer Bros since the renovation and prior, but this experience was very disappointing. I ordered the breakfast burrito and I have to say it's the worst one I've ever had. The chunks of potato were so large, there were barely any other ingredients in the wrap. And for the price of $12.95 they must have a Great food cost! 
For a town that has Breakfast burritos on every menu, I was scared to order another one over the weekend for fear of being disappointed again."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Loved this place! Best chicken fried steak I have ever had! Great service and good prices! The hash brown's are really good too! I will go back!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Food is incredible good! Service can be slow at times but in general is good too! Everything tastes good here! I do wish that for the oat meal if you they can add more nuts and fruit to it!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This was my second time coming here for breakfast and just as good the second time! My guy friends love how the portions are generous but I like how fresh the ingredients are so it's a real win-win. 
I personally am not a fan of hash browns or home fries so I think for my third time I'll ask for a biscuit instead since they have the most delicious biscuits and then it'd be the perfect breakfast :)"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,There service is great !! Super friendly staff. The food is great quality and the portions are good size. I go there frequently and would recommend it.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Love it here...modern diner setting, simple menu, affordable, friendly service! Not crowded...ordered the clam chowder, on point!!! Perfect spot for a casual breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,Farmer boy is pretty average. But it is an old fashioned diner so I suppose that is to be expected. I had the fried chicken biscuit sliders and they lacked flavor. The gravy was bland and needed more sausage and spices. Cinnamon rolls were good though!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Stayed next door to this gem.  We thought it was the original Farmer Boys, but nooooooooo, we were in for a surprise.  Awesome service, quickly served t order and super tasty.  We had two eyes toad in a hole, the cinnamon Bun and the Santa Barbara Omelette was so good.  Highly recommended and will be back again whenever I'm in SB!!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This place was slightly busy when we got there maybe 10 people total in the restaurant, it had potential it looked like an old diners style place I was excited . The menu was unfortunately was extremely outdated and it was around lunch time so I decided to splurge and get a steak with frys, I ordered my steak medium it came out well done no signs of red and it was weird the fat not rendered off and I actually don't know how they cooked it but it was pretty terrible def would not return nor do I recommend this place to anyone"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Best chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy I have ever had!  And I lived in the South so I oughta know!!  Great service, cool diner ambiance, excellent!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"we live 2 min  walk from this place, so went for breakfast. lovely vintage set up, super friendly and caring service. We also went once for lunch, i loved the fish taco. It is fresh, moist, and as I heard fresh catch, not some old stuff from the freezer. Very delicious, and prices are very reasonable."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Just had the fried chicken and waffles! Highly recommended to revisit this classic diner with a modern twist.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Nice job since the reopening. Very clean and seemed very spacious. Loud as we were sitting across from a table of kids celebrating grandmas birthday but no big deal. 
We sat near the back of the Restauraunt which was a little dark and the rear door of the restaurant was open facing the alley. Again not a huge deal but I feel it should of been shut since the AC was on high. 
So I ordered the two egg special with bacon, hash browns, English muffin and sausage on the side. 
I ordered scrambled eggs and received sunny side up. Didn't want to send back since it was busy and we had already waited 20 mins for the food. So I went ahead and ate the eggs sunny side up. Bacon and hash browns were great but the sausage was cold. Again my mistake by not sending back but did not want to wait for a new sausage. 
Coffee and OJ was good and waitress was great. 
Keep up the good work and I shall return soon"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"What a find. Sat at the counter ( just a few seats away from a very tanned Ron Popiel!) and had I e of the yummiest, heartiest breakfasts I've had in years. My son had the Santa Barbara Local omelette - with tri tip. OMG. 
I had the breakfast burger. So. Damned. Good. 
We split a homemade cinnamon roll. The perfect topper to a great breakfast.
Our gorgeous waitress was a delight. 
We'll be making this a regular stop when in SB. Wow."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I've been coming here since before the new owners remodeled/ revamped the place. As a place that was in my breakfast staples, I was pleasantly surprised when the new owners brought in a new menu but still managed to keep the same old style feel.

This is a friendly, no frills, breakfast experience. Pricing is on par with every other place that serves similar fare. Wait staff is always friendly, and most imprtantly food always comes out correct* and in a timely fashion.

If I was to have one gripe about anything... it would be the kitchen seems to slightly over cook their eggs. But knowing that ahead of time always always me to order accordingly."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Really surprised to see the bad reviews about this place. Country chic diner with top notch food and service. I highly recommend the crab cake benedict. I left a copy of a children's book I wrote titled ""The Innovative Engine"" (illustrated by my tattoo artist brother) for kids to read while they wait."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This is food like Grandma made..... If Grandma couldn't cook. 
Recently renovated, but somewhere along the way they just ignored the food part. 
This used to be an SB staple for admittedly old school breakfast served hot and well prepared. This is, sadly, no longer the case. 
Cold biscuits, semi warm and strangely clear-juice runny omelet and vinegar tasting, greasy, hash-browns. 
The service was equally lackluster. Asked for a side of sour cream, the server smiled, mumbled"" sure"" and immediately forgot. When it comes to wondering where to stop for breakfast, I will return the favor."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"If you're looking for an awesome little classic diner this is the place. I agree with Adam below  - I am from the east coast and have been missing the diners back home - this is pretty close! Good comfort food, friendly staff, varied menu. I love that they have a couple things ""on the lighter side"" that are just smaller portions of normal delicious diner food, like a small cheesburger and little side of fries, or one little waffle and some hashbrowns and a strip of bacon. You get to have the deliciousness without feeling too gluttonous. :)"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Farmer boy is one of my favorite places for breakfast in Santa Barbara. I usually get the country fried steak with some coffee. The food tastes great, but I wish the gravy was hot instead of warm when it comes out . Overall, the restaurant has a very mellow atmosphere with decor that leaves you feeling like you are in living in a different era. The prices are comparable to other eateries in Santa Barbara (between $10-$15 per plate). It's a little out of the way if you are staying in downtown, but there is usually no waiting here. My only complaint is that my coffee never gets refilled. If the service was better and the gravy was warmer, I would give it a 5 star rating. Still, it's worth a visit if you are in the area!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This place has had a really nice make over! Guess I hadn't been here in years, because the waitress said it had been like this for a couple years now. Before it looked like a greasy spoon diner from the 70s. Now it looks like a greasy spoon diner from the 2000s that's going for that 50s look. I like it!

As for the food, it's a-ok! Pretty standard breakfast/lunch diner. No real frills, just solid eggs and bacon type stuff with sandwiches/burgers for lunch. But they've also got three beers on tap: a national, a regional and a local. So that's kinda cool!

Good, quick service. All around decent place!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"My boyfriend and I had been meaning to stop by this place since we pass by it often. I'm so glad we finally did, especially considering how great of a deal their Summer Nights specials are! For about $11, you can get any one of their burgers, salads or wings plus a glass of beer or wine. Pretty solid incentive to try this place out if you haven't already. I ordered the Southern BBQ Bacon Burger ($6.95 served with fries) and it was a hefty serving. The patty was perfectly cooked and the ingredients tasted fresh - just some good ol' American diner cuisine. We ended dinner with a banana creme pie that our lovely waiter recommended (who can say no to pie, 'cmon) and it was just delicious, not too sweet and oh-so creamy. Did I mention they also have milkshakes, root bear floats, sundaes AND banana splits?! Yum. Overall, if you want some good food with good service, this is the place to go. I'll be back here myself to try out their breakfast (chicken and waffles, I'm coming for ya!)"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Food was good but called the day before and chose this place because it was a larger place and we had a party of 9 for Fathers Day.  We got there at the time they recommended and at the time they assured us we wouldn't have to wait too long.  One hour and fifteen minutes was unacceptable, especially when the told us (15 minutes into our wait) that they were clearing a table for us.  They then sat another party that came in after us."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Such amazing breakfast food here. Me and all of my friends gathered here for a celebratory breakfast after a fun night in SB. They accommodated us with amazing service, splitting the bill in multiple ways. We were a large group but they made sure we were taken care of and were super patient with the payments at the end. Awesome place, will come back again for sure"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,For breakfast this place was amazing. Wife had toads in a hole and I had the crab cakes Benedict both of which were absolutely scrumptious. I've never used the word scrumptious before but that's exactly what it was!!! Wish we were staying longer I'd try lunch and dinner here. If you like delicious food that isn't served in a crepe and is a good size then you will love this place. It's also very clean and had that 50's diner style theme which is cool. Not sure why it only has 3 1/2 stars it definitely deserves 4 1/2.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Just went here the other day with my girlfriend and I have to say, this place is pretty damn good. I will come back again. I just wished they served everything when they open instead of just breakfast. I work nights so the morning is my dinner time. This place none the less rocks."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,First time ordering from this place and the food was on point!  The restaurant itself is very clean and the host/hostess are very welcoming! A great environment!  I will be visiting this place again.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,I walked in and took a seat. The waitress acknowledged me and went on with her duties 10 minutes past and another Paton came in and took a seat next to me. The waitress handed her a menu as soon as she sat down. This was the second time ever at this establishment and needless to say but I will never visit this establishment again. I did like the food the first time I came in. If you want to feel welcome don't come to this restaurant. Look for something else just about any other place near by is great.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Frühstück am 16.07.18 mit 3 Personen. Sehr lecker. Sehr freundliche u. zuvorkommende Bedienung. Sauber u. gepflegtes Restaurant. Gut besucht. Durchaus jüngeres Publikum. Sehr angenehme Atmosphäre. Preis-Leistungsverhältnis sehr gut. Wir kommen wieder.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Wow! I lived in Santa Barbara for 9 years from 2007-2016 and had no idea this place even existed. While in a short overnight visit we stayed at a hotel across the street and decided to give it a shot. I got the Santa Barbara local omelet- I am an omelet gal and it's always my go to and this was legitimately one of the best omelets I have ever had! Huge chunks of meaty bacon and juicy tomatoes and the best tomatillo salsa ever made for one of the best breakfasts I have had...ever. The food is obviously fresh- and you can taste it. The staff is wonderful too--our servers were attentive (but not overbearing) and food came fast. My only regret is not knowing about this place when I lived here.. I will definitely be returning on my future visits! Dang Farmer Boy!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"They nailed it! We had a very good, clean, not offensively priced breakfast on Sunday. We got there before the 9am rush. It's diner food done right; it's not pretending to be something it's not. Nice attention to details (glass glasses not plastic) without being fussy."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Great service in a crowded restaurant! The Local breakfast was excellent and incredibly filling. My partner enjoyed his pancake and eggs. Thanks to all previous reviewers as we chose this based on you!!!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I have been looking for a favorite restaurant in SB for a while now and finally found it! Great food, wonderful staff and just an all around 5 star experience! First time there and I wanted to be a regular! A modern diner that is a must try!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I didn't eat here, but was so turned off by the hostess and poor service I had to yelp them. I walked in on Sunday morning and they were relatively busy, but there was no line. I stood about 3 feet away from the hostess stand, and a couple servers walked past me without a hello or greeting. They the hostess passed by and again, no hello or greeting...finally as she stood there just staring at me I asked if I could put my name in. No smile, no conversation, no wait time...just came off rude. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to sunshine cafe."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Delicious!  Everything was great from service to food!  We were a group of 5 gals.  No line at 8:30 on a beautiful Sunday morning.  They sat us in the corner booth, had no problem giving us separate checks and kept my coffee cup loaded!   

Great place!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,E X C E L L E N T  and worth the wait. Hash browns nice and crispy with very tasty ham.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Super good food, but service needs a little more work. Felt like me and my boyfriend did not get waited as quickly as the other customers because of some type of discrimination."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Terrific burger special after 3pm. $6.95 and made to order. San Roque Burger; Caramelized Onions, Bacon, and Bleu Cheese. Plus great onion rings."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"First time here. Great Breakfast options. The food was delicious and they brought it pretty quick. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs. This was absolutely delicious. My wife had the French toast. She loved it, the baggett they used was perfect. We will be back if we are in Santa Barbara again."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This place is awesome, great service , hostess and our waiter and busser were all very polite and attentive , food was legit. Good portions and great taste .not overly crowded and kid friendly . I'm in town from San Diego and of o ever come back I'm definitely coming here again. Stop by if you're in town you won't be disappointed"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This is not your fathers Farmer Boy.
Is this star reborn in the new and improved restaurant? What a difference some light makes. It's bright and beautiful in here but you'll pay for it.

The Brophy's team moved in and it shows. The chicken fried steak & eggs with homemade gravy (was $8.99) is reincarnated as a chicken-fried chicken slider for $10.75 and you'll have to cough up four more dollars if you want two eggs. The breakfast burritos did not make the cut but cinnamon rolls can still be found for $6. The Farmer Boy Buttermilk Pancakes maybe the most notable change. Still on the menu but what used to cost you $4.60 for a full stack will now ring up at $7.00. Wow. The French Toast only increased by .25. New to the menu is the fried chicken and waffles for $11. Add more chicken for four bucks more. Another new item worth mentioning is the Carnitas Chilaquiles $11.95.

I wanted the Chicken-Fried Biscuit Sliders with 2 eggs on the side for $4 more dollars (a little steep for a side of eggs that used to be .99ea.). Good thing the gravy is included. 
BUT
""Breakfast served all day"" is actually only until 11. How can you call that out on the menu and expect the caveat to fly? To be fair, there are a few items available all day but none I wanted. Went with the Philly Barbara for $12 with their rings. The bread was great and the meat tender and thinly sliced. I would order again if I make it back. 

Juice up. USB chargers in the booths! NOT Since 1958. Very cool Boy. 

I'm put back by the price increase and the limited breakfast menu hours. Seriously. You should not advertise Breakfast All Day. In the end, this Boy got a facelift, a much needed deep cleaning and a fancy new menu. Big changes, no longer old dark and tired. Better? Maybe. More expensive? Yep.
I'll pass and my guess is, so will those who used to call this place home. It's a Farmer Boy in name only. Will this new venture strive or end up like Arch Rock Fish?"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Went to bed hungry and woke up hungrier. Thankfully my friend did, also, and texted me to join her at Farmer Boy for pancakes. Best way to start my morning. Greeted by the manager and immediately helped and served a cup of coffee. The menu has it all but isn't overwhelming. I ordered my short stack with fresh blueberries which they add to the batter and sprinkle on top. They also dust them with powdered sugar. Butter and warm syrup come with. We had hash browns as well which were perfectly crisp. And the bacon is thick and cooked just right. We sat at the counter. Excellent service. Not too crowded @ 9:45 on a Saturday morning but lots of tables full of happy customers. So thankful for this outstanding breakfast spot!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,Has to be the worst farmer boy I've ever ate at. This location on State Street has lousy staff and poor quality. I'm very disappointed that you can't trust the quality of farmers boys anymore.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Finally Santa Barbara has a real East Coast style Dinner. As soon as I walked in here it reminded me of The Charcoal Pitt, this 50 year old dinner in Philly my mom used to take me to. The only thing that it was missing was a juke box. 

Girlfriend and I came in here for breakfast and we were glad that we did. She got the fried chicken  and waffles and I got the fried chicken and biscuit sliders with gravy. Could not have been more satisfied with our meals! 

Also, excellent service. Came in here 10 minutes before closing tonight and the guy behind the counter could not have been more friendly. I usually hate to go to a restaurant that sion before closing but he made me feel very welcomed and I ended up having one of the better sandwiches I have had in a long time. I mean come on, how can you beat a Meatloaf sandwich!! Perfectly cooked and a perfect way to end my Friday evening. I will definitely becoming here regularly as I live in the neighborhood."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,We went here for breakfast and we so enjoyed the food and prompt service! The coffee was great too. We will definitely be back again soon. Thank you for the great service!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This review is limited to breakfast and should be read accordingly. The breakfast selection is extremely limited. We had heard that they had great Eggs Benedict, but when we opened the menu they were nowhere to be found. Sounds like they went through a remodel and a change of ownership that resulted in the sparse breakfast menu they now have. 

The service was fine, although the waitress asked us what drinks we had so she could put them on our tab, I assume, since another waitress had taken our drink order. Poor form, in my opinion, as she could have easily asked her coworker for the same information. 

The food was pretty good. My wife's eggs were overcooked, which always amazes me in a place like this that serves breakfast all day. 

Meh, might be back, but there are plenty of other breakfast options in the area..."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Part of my routine when in SB. Pleasant atmosphere and staff. Fresh bfast items. Bagel's not so great. Chicken and biscuits are excellent. Hash browns are delicious. Never disappoints.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This place is a small hole in the wall! I ordered the chicken fried steak with hash browns and a piece of baguette. The bread was fresh and soft, delivered daily. The best part of the breakfast was the hash browns! They had a taste similar to tater tots. Steak was delicious! New breakfast spot for me to come to now in Santa Barbara."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Was driving back from San Luis Obispo and looking for a breakfast spot in Santa Barbara. Friendly & attentive servers. Fast service. Me and hubby ordered the crab cakes benedict, biscuits & gravy and the small appetite meal (pancakes). Food was great, except for the biscuits and gravy. It was very bland. Good portions though of everything. Comfortable seating, casual diner decor. If we are back in the area will definitely come back."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I should love this place but I don't.  The food is ok, some things even rate  a good.  It's the service, or lack of, that I can't get past. The place w cute, sort of like a diner. Customers mostly look like regulars. Either they don't mind the curt attitude or I haven't  been accepted into the group yet. I won't be sticking around to find out. Too many other options."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Farmer Boys nailed it!!
Vote for best breakfast in SB
Biscuits and Gravy are outstanding"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Not bad for the new revised, but not as good as old farmer boys. Also only one slice of bread with your breakfast instead of two like all other restaurants."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,This place is pretty freaking good.  I got the burger and it must have weighed 5 pounds.  So good.  I give it 4 stars because the service was really slow and took forever and a glass of iced tea was $4!!   I mean come on.  I'll be back for sure.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Love the renovation and the menu upgrade! Great service and amazing Carnitas Chilaquiles! I will be back with a posse.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This restaurant used to be good, but it has gone really really far downhill. The food tasted like they are serving semi-spoiled food that may have been cooked hours or days before. I actually feel physically ill and I think the health department should check this place out. My brothers food was dripping with orange grease, it was an omelet. I ordered the Toad in the Hole sandwich, which I used to love, and I had to take off the tomatoes and avocado. The tomatoes had white spots all over them and were yellow in the middle; they looked like they were maybe a day from being rotten, if not already. The avocado was covered in brown- grey spots. I honestly wanted to throw up after eating it. All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. I don't know how it has managed to stay in business this long, and it does not deserve to stay in business. Next time you want to eat out, go somewhere else instead."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Had the crab cake Benedict, Mediterranean omelet with sausage and the cinnamon roll. 

The crab cake Benedict comes with house made crab cakes on top of the English muffin and egg and hollandaise sauce. The crab cakes are  tasty with peppers inside. Could be a bit more crispy but was very tasty. 

The Mediterranean omelet was really good with lots of peppers. 

The cinnamon roll is huge and tasty. It comes out warmed. Nice cream cheese frosting. 

The best thing are the buttery hash browns. You can taste the butter with every bite. 

The downside of this place is the service. They don't refill coffee or water. The wait staff always needs to be flagged down. If they fix this, Farmer Boy would be perfect."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Good food, good service!

The eggs Benedict was delicious, as were the hash browns! I think everything was priced pretty reasonably, too.


Will definitely be coming back to this classic spot for a good breakfast. 

It would be nice there was more seating outside, though."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Such a nice, clean change for a diner. The food and service are always excellent. Love all the big windows, photographs, and wall of ketchup! Recommend the cinnamon roll as well as the chicken with waffles!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Love visiting farmer boy. When we go we almost always get the chilaquiles, they're the best!! The food is so yummy and great quality. If you have a sweet tooth I would recommend a cinnamon roll to split at the table, so good! It's a great vibe too like a classic diner. There can be a bit of a wait on the weekends but it's worth it!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This is a good place for a nice hearty morning breakfast. They also make some stellar salads as well. I like going on my lunch break for a quick bite at the counter. Service can be a wee slow at times, but overall you can get in and out in an hour"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Had a delicious brunch with my boyfriend! We were so excited to sit down in a diner again! The veggie omelet was amazing and so were the chicken and waffles. The chicken unfortunately was really dry and burnt on one side.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"A tasty example of the all American comfort food breakfast, with an energetic atmosphere and service."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Awesome food! Nice place & friendly staff. Defiantly recommend this place when passing through Santa Barbra.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This place is great! Everything from the atmosphere to the service! The food was also amazing. I wanted to try everything! I ended up getting tri tip sandwich with onion rings (I will get this again for sure). The food came super quick, all drinks were refilled multiple times. Our server, I forgot her name, was very attentive, sweet and knowledgeable of the menu. The atmosphere is retro chic I would say, super fun! Even though we had to wait, Danny at the front made  the experiance so enjoyable. Definitely worth worth a try!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"this a great place to eat !! everything was great !! biscuits and gravy, eggs and bacon !!  breakfast food and a shake afterwards !! highly recommended !!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This is not the old Farmer Boy, and that's a good thing.  Back in the day, I was served sour orange juice and cottage cheese past it's prime.  Now, ingredients are fresh, flavorful and service is snappy.

Worth mentioning: Chilequiles are very good.  I think I could make a case that Farmer Boy's Chilequeles are some of the best in town if you like carnitas (pork) with them.  While I think the Boat House chilequeles win for presentation & visual appeal, their chilequeles are lacking in the pork department.  Farmer Boy is more generous with the pork.  The salsa has a slight tang that I like.  Will definitely have them again.  One minor issue, poached eggs ordered soft, one was medium one was firm.  Not a big deal on a busy day, but a little room for improvement there.

Service was prompt & courteous; the staff truly works well as a team, they all seem to have each other's back.  Our server Nise was on point during our busy Saturday breakfast.  When a large party was taking her time, another server helped deliver drinks & kept things moving.

The family that runs this joint (along with Brophy's) knows service & good food keep people coming back.

I have one suggestion for improvement.  The place is LOUD when full.  The back room has an acoustic panel on the ceiling to help attenuate noise; unfortunately it's not enough.  I suggest changing the artwork to prints on acoustic panels vs. the epoxy alumninum or fiberglass photo prints... although the artwork is pretty, it makes everyone's voice ricochet off the walls and for me, it's unpleasantly noisy for this diner on a busy day.  

It's good to see this restaurant back in a much ""new and improved"" state."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Great food in casual setting. Friendly service. New veggie burger fooled me. Thought I'd been served a beef burger...but it is vegan!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Come for the food, stay for the great service! Cozy, friendly,  great at requests. They treat you like a regular even if you're a tourist. 

The busboys are a delight to watch, believe it or don't.  They must have extrasensory powers to detect spills, low coffee levels, and empty plates. You feel as if your needs are anticipated. The waitstaff is excellent. Friendly, not cloying. 

My husband has this thing about hashbrowns.  He wants them crispy all the way through.  I call them cremated,  but that's how he likes them. So many places, he had had to send back his plate. He asked once here. They nailed them. It was a thing of beauty. 

Prices are fair, quality is great, portions are appropriate, not overwhelming. Everything was delicious. There are phone charging stations at many of the booths. Check out the funky art, including a wall of ketchup bottles. 

If we lived here, this would be a regular breakfast place for us."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Review by my 9 year old granddaughter, Luca:
They were a very good service to us just when we got there they help us right away. Also there stile is very cool it is like a old fashion dinner that you can come into and sit right down. We came down to head to a family reunion and we wanted to eat at a very good burger place and we found farmer boy we are super happy we can come here we hope we can come again."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Service is satisfactory but the place is quite crowded and loud, which is somewhat surprising because I honestly am not a fan of their food. It's very greasy, unlike other healthier spots in Southern California. I left with a pretty bad stomach ache. It's okay that it's unhealthy, I didn't come here for health food, but I didn't expect to leave with an upset stomach..."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"While enjoying  a trip to Santa Barbara we decided to try Farmer Boy for breakfast. We opted to drive since this was quite a distance from where we were staying. While this is located on State Street it is quite a way from Cabrillo Drive. I tried their carnitas chilaquiles and they serve a pretty big portion as I was only able to eat 1/2 of it.  Very good. This has a cute local diner Atmosphere with reasonable prices, good service and good food."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Chilaquiles were delicious. Pancakes were ""meh"". Otherwise, we ordered a simple eggs and sausages meal for the kiddos and the sausage was there favorite part. Happy campers=happy mom. Make sure you pick up your utensils and napkins if you will need them. Unfortunately, we didn't and since we were staying at a hotel we had to eat everything like cavemen."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"My bf and I were in Santa Barbara for the weekend and found this place randomly and decided to stop. It was around 11:30 on a Sunday and it was packed but we didn't wait any longer than 15 minutes.
I got the 2 eggs, with hashbrowns and an English muffin.. usually a basic breakfast but I was surprised that it was really yummy. We also tried the French toast..they weren't our favorite because of the baguette that they use but it was still yummy. I would definitely recommend."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,I wife and I frequently go to Farmer boy. Today I decide to get something new Baja scramble with jalapeños cilantro chorizo and onions when I cannot start the evening it was very good I noticed right off the bat that there was no cilantro because there is nothing green.  Then I realize that the jalapeños were not jalapeños they were bell peppers I've worked in progress for 20 years I can tell the difference between the jalapeño an adult pepper there were no seeds no membrane no heat whatsoever. I asked the server if they had maybe run out of jalapeños and they just used regular ball peppers she went to the kitchen and I could hear the crooked laugh and say no they're just not hot she came back to me and said no he is regular Jalapeños but they're just not hot. I'm sorry but anyone that it's a jalapeño knows the jalapeño taste like anyone that it's a Bellpepper afterwords knows it especially a green bell pepper which are very hard to digest And you burp them up.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Just like the other reviews have stated this place did not disappoint:
- Ample seating
- Friendly staff
- Kid friendly (they have those sticky stix!)
- Delicious food
- Large quantities

We came for breakfast on a Saturday around 8am and were seated immediately. My wife had the eggs, home fries (wonderfully crunchy exterior and large chunks!), sausage, and pancakes. I had the huevos rancheros and both were great, if not a bit too much, but won't complain about that as we were on vacation. We had more than enough to share with our son. If we are in the area again we'll definitely be back. Love it."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Food was pretty good but, steak was well when I ordered it rare.  The manager was nice and gave us this massive cinnamon roll to make up for it.  Service was the best we experienced in Santa Barbara.  Friendly and attentive.  Thanks"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I mistakenly left my credit card there and called to ask if they had it or if it had been stolen. The response of the person who answered the phone was, ""I'm in the middle of the lunch rush right now. [This was at 10:55 AM.] You need to call back after 1:00."" I replied, ""I need to know if my credit card has been stolen."" The response I got was, ""I can't help you now. You need to call back later."" 
Thanks a lot, guys. I'm going to take what had been my weekly business elsewhere."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I wish I had discovered this place sooner! When a friend invited me to brunch one morning, I hadn't heard of it, but little did I know that it was going to be the start of a beautiful relationship. 

Located on Upper State, it's right across from 7-11 in an unassuming plaza with plenty of parking. 

The menu is reminiscent to that of Cajun Kitchen's, complete with lots of choices of brunch and comfort food. I went with the chicken-fried biscuit sliders and less than 10 minutes later, they came out looking delectable! 

The chicken was fried really well and the batter reminded me of the batter at Brophy Bros, which makes sense because they also own this restaurant. The gravy was flavorful and complimented the chicken and biscuits well. 

Service was quick and friendly and the price was just right. Overall a great place to go and I'm sure I'll be back soon!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Perfection......something I say very rarely for any restaurant anywhere !!!
Thanks to other ""yelpers"" we decided to try Farmer Boy at 9am on a Sunday...expected the worst but instead got the very best
We were seated at a very comfortable booth immediately, lover the décor throughout, and within 2 minutes our server Mike appeared to take order ...he was extremely friendly and helpful and drinks were served immediately and food within 10 minutes. I had the waffle with chicken strips and without doubt this was the best waffle I have ever had anywhere....the chicken was also delicious and I was unable to finish the huge portion .....but did the best I could !!!!......My wife had the pancake special and bacon and eggs were cooked exactly as requested.....also the pancakes were perfect
The atmosphere was very laid back but everything was quietly efficient and all the staff appeared to be happy and friendly...we were offered frequent refills ( even after paying the bill) and there is no doubt we will be returning on a regular basis ....very highly recommended and thanks Mike for being our excellent server"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"At the risk of sounding crazy, my previous review was glowing compared to this one. I was treating my almost 20 year old son to a birthday breakfast. He has never been to FB and I assured him he would not be disappointed. Around 9 on a Friday morning and about half of the tables were occupied. We found a booth in the back. We were seated and greeted and ordered water. After a bit, our waitress acknowledged us and I placed an order for a cinnamon roll to share. My son ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. I ordered the 2 eyed frog sandwich. We both ordered extra crispy hash browns. The cinnamon roll is the best in town. Our order was late to arrive and cold upon arrival. The tomatoes in my breakfast sandwich were green (not ripe) and avocado only on half of the sandwich. The hashed browns were room temp and soft. Because we had 3 different people serving us, I feel certain that the food sat for a while before it was served. Just a big disappointment $41 dollars. (We drank water, even!) The best part was spending time celebrating my son and catching up...next time just a cinnamon roll will do!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Terrible service , was not even  busy .
 My friend and I sat down and then 2 other couples come in after us , waitress takes their order before ours . I tell   waitresses I we  would like to order , then one of  the other couples recieved half their order before we even placed ours .
 Terrible ... so disappointed."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I wanted to check it out, being a fan of a good burger.  The closet scientist in me went for their single plain burger rather than anything fancy so I could make a fair comparison against other burger stands.  Lettuce, tomato, onions. I opted against the cheese on the thought it would hide the true flavor of the meat.  
It was OK, not muy especial.  Meat flavor didn't stand out as ooooo! yummy!!  Although I might return for breakfast, I wouldn't return for a burger.
Based on another person's review, I hopped over to Fatburger three days later to compare their plain single burger against Farmer  Boy's.  Fatburger's burger was definitely mas bueno. More flavor, juicier."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Quick fast and pretty tasty! I had the breakfast burrito and can't complain. If it were closer to my house, I would certainly come here more often."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"My husband and I stopped here for breakfast en route to visit several Los Olivos area wineries and we both enjoyed our meals; the menu is reminiscent of what you'd find in the Southeastern US (e.g., fried chicken and waffles, pancakes, assorted omelette options, etc.) and everything we ordered was well-made and served hot. The restaurant itself was cute in a roadside-diner-meets-midcentury-modern aesthetic kind of way. I'd definitely keep this place in mind for future SB trips."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This restaurant was fairly populated this Saturday afternoon! I have been looking forward to trying this place and ordered the classic pancake combination. The quality of the food was outstanding, right down to the powdered sugar atop the pancakes.. however, I was disappointed with the portion sizes. I left the restaurant thinking about what we will be having for lunch! That might just be because of how delicious everything was... not sure. The workers were all very friendly and nice to look at, making it an overall unique experience."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Sat down at 1:35pm. I was then subsequently told that the place is closing, fifty-two minutes early.  On their website it says they close at 2:30pm. They didn't give me a reason why, they were just closed. Nice. Go to Cajun Kitchen, a local favorite if you have an urge for late breakfast. They are ALWAYS open until 3:00pm. (Excluding major holidays of course)."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Great breakfast. Super coffee. Friendly local owners. Impressive food quality.  Remember to support local business .
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"We decided to check out Farmer Boy when we discovered it re-opened.  
First the positive:
-food was good (we had Belgian waffle, the country sausage omelet, and the 2 egg plate)
-interior was beautiful
-outdoor seating was dog friendly
-Service was good/sufficient
-kid friendly/lots of families around

The negative:
-while our food was good, it wasn't amazing, and there were some issues 1) I really would have appreciated more fruit options on the menu (like a side of a fruit cup).  I did decide to order the berries for my waffle (at a $3.00 charge, over the bananas for $1.50) because I thought it would fulfill my fruit craving, but for $3.00 there was a total of 8 blueberries on my waffle they ended up looking really sad. 
-things seemed a bit on the pricier side, but I have come to expect that in SB
-crowded (this isn't really a negative, just a warning) we got there right before a big rush, so  we were seated immediately, but 15 min later, there was a long wait (about 9:15ish...on a Sunday, so it's to be expected)

While it may sound like I'm downgrading them on the basis of a lack of a fruit cup, mainly I was just a tiny bit underwhelmed.  Things were good, but just not amazing, and maybe I had high expectations since I had been waiting for it to reopen for awhile.  I will definitely go back and check it out again, and hopefully add more stars."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"What a disappointment this breakfast was.  Stayed in the area and saw this place driving down State Street so thought we would try a locals breakfast spot.  

The veggie eggs benedict was cold.  Yes, cold semi-toasted English muffins, cold eggs and cold hollandise sauce.  Okay, can understand the tomatoes, spinach and avocado being luke warm, but cold eggs?
Yuck.  
 
The service wasn't exactly great or I would have complained, the wait staff just looked like they didn't want to be there.  Choose another spot!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"we always return to Farmer Boy when visiting Santa Barbara...this time we had our 2 dogs with us so had to sit outside ( limited seating )
Nick ( or O'co ?) immediately recognized us and made a great fuss of the dogs...he also provided excellent , friendly service and made us feel very welcome
Food is great for us, simple, well prepared and presented nicely...oh , and everything tastes the way it should ( wish other restaurants could do this !!!)
we had a most pleasant lunch and will return for breakfast before departing back to LA
Excellent breakfast/lunch spot, with easy parking ....just remember they close at 2-30 pm"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,After so long I finally got to try out Farmer Boy and I regret not trying it earlier. Modern diner style with the best huge cinnamon rolls! The cinnamon rolls are made for sharing and worth the price. There is plenty or free parking and will normally be a short wait if you come during brunch.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"OMG this place is soooooo good! I don't comment a lot on here, but I just ate a fantastic meal! Crab Cake Benedict and coffee so good!!! This is nothing like the burger chain you might think it is!!! Come in and taste a great meal!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Their breakfast burritos are awesome!  Nick was very friendly and helped out with a large order of 71 burritos.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"First of all the staff is exceptional.  I was visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend and stayed at Hyatt Centric just down the street from this restaurant.  

  WOW they can cook some great food!  My husband had chicken and biscuits with gravy and it was so good.  I had a the best omelet ever with lots of veggies.  

When in Santa Barbara I will make sure I stop by for their great food.   

Side note...my husband is a big foodie."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Oh. My.

We were here on Fiesta weekend, which, if you're not familiar, is a crazy-big deal. So they were packed. 

Even so, our server was incredibly friendly and helpful. The food was, honestly, just beyond. The home fries and the hash browns were both so unique and delicious - you simply MUST try both. The hash browns were crispy on the outside with a creamy, almost cheesy interior, and the home fries were made with a variety of baby potatoes, roasted, fried, and seasoned to perfection. Oh, and make sure to try one of their buttery, homemade biscuits. 

We tried the two-eyed toad in a hole sandwich, the green veggie omelette, and a country sausage scramble. All were delectable."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Excellent food and service.  We usually share a 3 egg omelette because they are so big.  Delicious bacon!  And home make biscuits!  Absolutely go and enjoy home cooked food. 
Excellent service as well"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Awesome place for breakfast. There biscuits are amazing. I will dream about the biscuits. It was super yummy and they have outdoor seating. Service was good even though they were very busy. I would return.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Shared a meal here with my daughter, son-in-law, and new granddaughter.
 The service was excellent! 
The food was absolutely over-the-top tasty!
 We would highly recommend little restaurant if you're anywhere near Santa Barbara."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I'd give this place negative stars. We first called and they said they had a 10 minute wait, when we arrived 10 minutes later there was a 45 minute wait. We happily waited. When 45 minutes past we checked in with the list and they said we were next in line they then proceed to sit another family right in front of us. I want to be understanding especially given these times of covid but our family the only people of color waiting was very disappointed."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Best breakfast in town, family friendly, great staff and amazing tasting food, most flavorful breakfast I've had in town, me and my wife are loyal to Saturday morning breakfast here and would never switch it up, we bring all friends and family that visit from out of town and when they come back they always say ""let's go to that breakfast spot we went to last time"" and farmer boy it is"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Breakfast was amazing here. Service was great. Had the SB scramble and the chicken and fried biscuit sliders and both were amazing, a must try."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"We've only been once, but the food was good and the service was on point. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"We went to Farmer Boy on a friends recommendation and were not disappointed. The service was super friendly and fast. The food, delicious. The portions are large, so my teenage son was completely satisfied. They know how to make a wonderful cup of coffee! 
Great place."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Delicious! All the way from Boulder Colorado and I think this place is the best breakfast place we've stopped at for the last 3,000 miles on the road. Stop in here for a bite to Eat. Good customer service and great food."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"The food is very top notch here, so that definitely deserves a 5 stars. My group and I really did enjoy our different versions of Eggs Benedict. It was flavorful, very savory, and such a great dish. I personally ordered the version that included either the crab or lobster and it was really delicious. So, the criticism doesn't really rely on the food itself. It more so relies on the waiter that took our orders.

His name was Michael and he was a great guy, until towards the very end when he had brought our check over. We asked if we could split the check. To that, he slowly put his hands together with a slight heavy sigh so that we all took notice and replied with, 

""We are currently slammed at the moment. It would have been better if you guys had told me in the very beginning to get split checks"", he said with a disappointed look. 

He just stood there while we took a quick glance at each other. We had told him that it would be no problem, and we could pay on one card and the rest of us would Venmo that individual. We were perfectly fine with doing this, but we were not okay at all with his approach to the situation. 

Isn't it standard work process for the waiter themselves to ask in the beginning if we are all going to be on one check or if it's going to be separated? Because that's what we came to be familiar with when working with our waiters. 

With that, our only critique is this. Please train your waiter(s) about proper standard work process and to follow suit to those of other restaurants. I honestly hope that the establishment takes this critique very seriously , because I wouldn't want another group to experience the same feeling of pressure that we felt from Michael. Other then that, we did thoroughly enjoy the food, just not the waiter."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"All I can say is, well I can't, my mouth is full of the divine and oh so heavenly cinnamon roll. If I didn't know better, I would think I am eating a Cinnabon. Luckily I didn't need the heart defibrillator or ambulance ride:) 

Farmer Boys offers mostly traditional breakfast options but cooked perfectly and portioned for an average American eater. 

Good service - check
Yummy food - check
Decent prices - check
Adequate location - check
Will I be back? - affirmative"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Great local breakfast spot. Great service. Friendly staff. Good ""real"" food. I'm coming back when in Santa Barbara."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Food was really good. service was ass except the host he was cool. The waitress was garbage
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Stayed at the hotel 6 right by this place so we could take our dog to the dog beach. (He's 100 pounds and the more six is the only place we could find that didn't have a weight limit). We walked over here for breakfast and fell
In love with the staff and laid back atmosphere. I had the two eyed toad for breakfast and told my wife it's officially my new fave breakfast. My wife had a simple eggs, hash browns and a pancake and agreed it was all reallly fresh and yummy even for a super simple meal. Will be coming back anytime we're in SB. Also, the waitresses were all so stinking sweet and told us all the best spots for pups we hadn't heard of."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Best breakfast we have had!  Visiting Santa Barbara and found this gem.  Instead of waiting for a table, they quickly accommodated us by bringing another table outside from inside.  Every time our drinks/coffee we're getting low, they were immediately replenished.  Food was absolutely delicious and our waiter gave us great advice on what to get.  Highly recommend this place.  I rarely do reviews but this place was too good not to."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Love coming here when the family is all in town. Everyone is friendly and courteous, which is why we frequent the establishment as often as we do."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Dropped in for lunch...ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with fries for both my wife and I. Then I thought I would like a cup of clam chowder. After 15 minutes, I signaled my server that I would like to have the clam chowder before the meal. She went over to ask the cook, but then brought our meals instead. She claimed the chowder was not ""...ready"" yet. A couple minutes later she brought the chowder. I took a spoonful into my mouth. Cold chowder. Then I noticed a funny taste and something red in my clam chowder. I took it up to the waitress and asked, ""Is there bacon or ham in my clam chowder?"" She answered with question ""Why? Are you allergic?"" I replied, ""NO! I just don't want to eat red meat and there was nothing in the menu about it containing pork""
I gave it back and did not get charged for it, but the service was lousy, (our waitress continually disappeared for long periods,...). I ALWAYS tip 20% and this was the first time in quite a while that I left a 10% amount.

What is it that people have with this bacon fetish? It's CLAM CHOWDER!! WTF? Why ruin a perfectly good soup by sneaking bacon into it and NOT STATING THIS IN THE MENU?!

I am not recommending because of the service and quality."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"We were disappointed in the overall quality of our breakfast here. The reviews looked hopeful but I would say it's just mediocre.  We got scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns (all were average) and a side of biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were very dry and dense and gravy was pretty tasteless. The coffee was average too. This could be a cool place but needs to be overhauled."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"As we were about to head home from our weekend trip in Santa Barbara, we decided to get one last meal in town, so we stopped for brunch at Farmer Boy. The wait for 4 at around 10:30am was no more than 10 minutes on a Sunday, which I thought was pretty good. As we got seated and asked what we wanted to drink, I promptly asked for some toast (I might of had a rough night). We ordered two Santa Barbara scrambles, ones with tri tip, the fried chicken biscuit sliders with gravy and a Belgian waffle. The scrambles were both a hit and pretty large portions. My Belgian waffle was exactly what I needed to cure my hang over and it was perfectly fluffy inside with a slight crunchy exterior, they also give you hot syrup which is always a plus in my book. My brother in law was pretty disappointed with his sliders, he did enjoy the chicken but he ended up hardly eating much of it because he did not enjoy the gravy at all, he mentioned that it almost seemed watery. The waitress was friendly but they were pretty busy when we got seated and waited a pretty long time for our food, but that's understandable. I think I'd visit again if I'm ever back in town, but I'd maybe skip anything with the gravy."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"A friend and Farmer Boy regular introduced me to this great restaurant, conveniently located off of State St. and easy to access via Bus #11. It is a pretty straightforward American-cuisine focused plus with not a lot of surprises. However, they make up for it in quality food, and low prices, especially if you eat after 3 p.m. when their happy hour/ specials kick in. You can get a burger and fries for like $9! I tried their massive and insane chicken wings (which look like those at the Benchmark if these are any indication .... more drumsticks than wings); the tomato bisque; and the onion rings. I am definitely going to return and try other things on the menu. This is a great addition to the area."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Mr SNOWMAN agrees that this restaurant is STILL THE BEST!! Incredible buttermilk pancakes! I have NOT found any other place to compare quality! I used to go here almost every day when I lived here! Congratulations on surviving covid-19! I WILL BE BACK!!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I went here with a large group and most of the people had a positive experience. There were breakfast options for the vegetarian in the group, but for me, being lactose intolerant, it was very difficult to find something to eat. I asked about a few things and while they did have soy milk for my coffee, most of the food items contained dairy. I ended up ordering a basic hashbrown/bacon/eggs combo. When everyone's food came out, I only got a small serving of eggs and bacon. They didn't bring out the hashbrowns because they contained dairy. Why they decided to go ahead with my meal when I could not eat the largest portion of it was puzzling to me. I tried to figure out what else they could bring me instead, and the only option I could eat was toast. So a few minutes later, out comes ONE dry, thin piece of toast to replace a half-plate of hashbrowns. There was no dairy-free spread. I paid $7 that day for a piece of toast, 2 small eggs, and 1 piece of bacon. 

If the communication had been better, there might have been something else I could have ordered, but sadly that is what happened. I will not be returning."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I love this place, no matter what your decision everything is super delicious, I love going to enjoy a good breakfast there"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Breakfast/brunch places are all starting to offer the same thing nowadays so I didn't really expect anything spectacular when I came in. Farmer Boy does offer some of the same egg and pancake dishes that other restaurants offer, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that their portions are manageable and priced pretty fairly. Also, I really appreciated that pancakes were offered with their egg dishes along with the usual varieties of toast - usually you would have to pay extra to get a side of pancakes at other breakfast spots. They even offer a baguette for free too which you don't see at typical breakfast restaurants.

Now for the food: pretty good! I'm not typically an omelette type of person but I truly enjoyed my Baja omelette. Very flavorful and had the perfect ratio of everything. Service was really great as well, it was pretty busy in there since it was a Sunday morning but we were still seated and served pretty quickly. They checked up on us often regardless of the crowd and we got everything we needed. Definitely going to come back and try everything else they offer!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This restaurant was very cute, sadly the indoor dining is still closed. The service was good, the food was okay though. I had the breakfast burger, I would not recommend sadly. The bun felt oily. On the other hand the salmon Benedict was good, but the egg was not really poached but cooked through which means it wasn't poached properly, not too big of a deal. The service was good and the area was clean."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Classic old-time diner look and feel. Great service every time! The food is so tasty- breakfast or lunch!  We love coming here
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,They now serve breakfast all day and said they may be serving dinner as well. Their french toast is pretty good just a bit overpriced for just three pieces of baguette. What made it nice was the workers. They're very friendly and talkative made us feel welcomed.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,FIRST TIMER!! I had the country fried steak. Was really good! flavorful with the sausage gravy on top. I can see why everyone was ordering the gravy biscuit!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Best place in SB for breakfast. The food and staff are always great. My family and I love coming here.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Amazing! I have lived in SB for 15 years and went here for first time and loved it! Hash browns perfectly crispy, chocolate cream but, dark, creamy, just the right sweetness. Setting is clean and bright and server was nice. Cinnamon bun huge and loads of yummy cream cheese Icing which we ate the next day and was still good. Milkshakes good too! Reasonable prices, comfy booths."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Farmer Boy takes me back to my Midwestern roots of visiting a diner or soda fountain. There are Heinz Ketchup bottles on the wall, images of dairy cows, a milkshake machine on the long counter, a neon sign touting their homemade pie and welcoming staff to top it off. Of course they offer the basic breakfast staples like other breakfast/brunch restaurants in the area (omelets, french toast, pancakes, and breakfast burritos). However, they also have some wonderful unique options (i.e. Breakfast Burger, Carnitas Chilaquiles, Chicken Fried Biscuit Sliders, and Fried Chicken & Waffles). My mom use to make me Toad in a Hole (also called Man on a Raft) as a child. Well Farmer Boy takes my childhood favorite up a notch with a 2-Eyed Toad-In-A-Hole Sandwich: Aged cheddar, crisp bacon, avocado & sliced tomato, nestled between two butter-grilled eggs in rustic toasted bread. What's not to love!!!

What also sets Farmer Boy apart, you ask?:
- All Day Breakfast options; they do offer lunch but close at 2:30 PM daily
- Two killer homemade salsas (verde avocado salsa and a chunky rojo salsa)
- The ""Small Appetite"" Breakfast with your choice of two scrambled eggs or silver dollar pancakes or mini waffle with hash browns, bacon, butter and syrup
- Freshly baked Apple, Chocolate Cream and Key Lime pies with the option of a scoop of ice cream
- Electric plugs at the booths featuring USB chargers
- The Bennett Family takes pride in supporting local nonprofit organizations and schools in Santa Barbara and Ventura since 1979; you can submit a form through their website if you're raising money for a good cause

The restaurant also offer great Daily Specials:
- MONDAY: Meatloaf Sandwich or Entree
- TUESDAY: Taco Tuesday with Baja Fish Tacos or Carnitas
- WEDNESDAY: Wild Mac N Cheese (with bacon)
- THURSDAY: Tasty Treats discounts on pies, shakes and ice cream
- FRIDAY: TGIF discounted draft beers and mimosas

Often there is a line, and for a good reason. Check them out!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"The location was very nice. The food was excellent. I ordered an omelette and instead of having a traditional side of hash browns, they had sautéed spinach as a no-cost substitution, since I was trying to keep the starch off my plate. 

The service was excellent and very attentive!! My coffee cup was always full and my water never made it below the halfway point. The food came out promptly, nice and hot! 

The pandemic has everyone sitting outside and socially distanced, but it's not such a bad thing in a nice spot like Farmer Boy has. 

I'd highly recommend Farmer Boy to anyone in the area!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This is one of the coolest diners I've ever eaten at! Farmer Boy is an old fashioned diner you would see in a film from the 1950s, complete with a soda fountain and barstools. 

The food is incredible! I had the Santa Barbara Local, which is three scrambled eggs with  tomatillo salsa, bacon, diced tomatoes, cheddar cheese and avocado. And you BEST BELIEVE that I would add TRI-TIP to that! Wow! One of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Incredibly filling and tasty. The hash browns on the side were also out of this world, incredibly buttery and crispy. I also had a pancake, which was very delicious. 

But what stood out here the most was the incredibly friendly and attentive service. My order came out very quickly and the servers were all incredibly cordial. They even offered me a Diet Coke to-go! 

I can't wait to visit Farmer Boy again in the future!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Absolutely delicious! Staff is so friendly. Carryout ready in 10 minutes! Ingredients very fresh, all flavors great! Highly recommend! I'm from the restaurant industry and I approve this message!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Great Service, there is no vegan options on the menu, but a little fix on your main dish goes long way. The carnitas-chilaquiles mixed with Mediterranean veggies dish. Remove the carnitas and add veggies to the chilaquiles."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"This was the most expensive bagel of my life time and it was an ordinary everyday bagel. They even charged me $3.95 for one egg (they charge $4.95 for two eggs)! Honestly, don't pay this much for an every day bagel. Support a local business which is not owned by crooks!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Great service and the best hash browns in SB.  If I were ordering my last meal, it would be the Farmer Boy Classic breakfast, eggs over medium, crispy hash browns, fruit instead of meat (healthier, even though it's my last meal), and sourdough toast.  Note that Farmer Boy serves only one slice of toast, to avoid waste, but will happily provide two if you ask, for no extra charge.

Very accommodating and friendly staff! 

We're so happy they're open again!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Santa Barbara trips never complete without a meal at Farmer Boy ... They never fall to please!!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,My Dad enjoyed a great business meal out at Farmer Boys today and highly recommended it. If you love the diner feel this is a great place with quality food from trustworthy sources. He brought me the chilaquiles which were delicious. The pickled onion went great with them which I did not expect and they give you a great portion. I am also extra sensitive to spice and the chilaquiles did not bother me at all! Win Win! Can't wait to go in person.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Part of my routine when in SB. Pleasant atmosphere and staff. Fresh bfast items. Bagel's not so great. Chicken and biscuits are excellent!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"The food was very tasty!! We got carnita chilaquiles & country fried steak with home potatoes & a biscuit that was really good. Staff was very courteous & professional. Very good service, can't wait to go back. Would definitely recommend restaurant."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Stopped here again for their awesome fish & chips. They were as good as I had remembered. This time I also noticed they had pie- homemade and yummy. I tried the orange almond coconut pie Wow.  I also enjoyed the music - David Bowie & the Stones. The new Farmers Boy on Upper State is really great!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Make this a destination on your visit to Santa Barbara.   The photos can't show what the wonderful spirit from coming here brings.   

Coming to Santa Barbara for the International Film Festival and seeing celebrities was surely a treat, especially on a rainy February weekend when watching the Super Bowl was not the top of my list.  

What was SPECIAL is Farmer Boy.  So much so the two days we were here brought us here twice so far, but we are planning to return again before we leave on Monday.  

The initial mention to come to Farmer Boy after my friend Kevin asked about recommendations and listing what he was hungry for (pancakes, a breakfast burrito or something really special and known locally by regulars) came by way of local hotel staff.  

And are we glad we listened to their recommendation.  

Not only are the staff (Katie, Kim and Nick get shout outs from Kevin and me) but they were who we came in contact with.  Warm and kind, personable, happy folks that truly enjoy serving people and making sure they are happily fed and enjoy their food was the compliment  you get with an amazingly warm and down home meal, be that breakfast or lunch.  The smiles on their faces show up in the food and that is contagious in today's need for truly genuine authentic love and happiness in our daily lives.  

We had the items in the photographs and the descriptions don't do them justice.   

But here are some real honorable mentions:  fluffy scrambled eggs, a bagel that has a moist inside, perfectly toasted outside, country biscuits that were perfect...flaky and soft with  a savory sausage gravy.  The kind of biscuits that taste amazing with gravy, butter or syrup.    Hard to find them unless you're down south somewhere.  Fried chicken well seasoned and with the right about of flavoring.  Not salty but well seasoned.  The clam chowder was chocked filled with clam, potatoes and a silky broth.  But the cinnamon roll was an amazing piece of bakery badness.  Holy hotness.   

But also, PERFECT CUP OF JOE.  The coffee was amazing.  Hard to find a good cup of coffee.  Because it's here!   

We need this place and you are missing something truly special.   Several folks we saw leave said 'see you next time I'm in town' or 'so glad I came back'.   You can tell they were happy they were here and Farmer Boy consistently hits it out of the park.   A wonderful place to come.  And affordable. Saw lots of groups and families here.  

COME HERE and you will continuously come back, just to try something you couldn't have the last time you were here."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Its no wonder why this establishment always has a line to be seated. Delicious meals are served hot and plentiful throughout the day. The staff is always friendly and really make you feel welcome, regardless how busy they may be. Inside is always busy, but you never feel rushed through your seating. Farmer Boy is one of those restaurants that will have you coming back time and time again... even all the way from L.A.!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Do you have a comfort food palette, but a high maintenance sense of decor? In the mood for solid diner food and huge portions, but still want good photo options for the gram? Look no further. 

Service & atmosphere: the space has been redone by the Brophy team, and its adorable with retro lighting, bright and fresh color palette, and a full ketchup wall. Service was fantastic, our server was warm, friendly, attentive, but gave us lots of space to chat and stuff our faces. 

Food: The best part about eating with other people who have self-control is that they will leave food left for you, the person who has never heard of a ""single serving"". Farmer Boy is a fantastic place for this to play out since portions are ginormous. Between the country fried steak, biscuits and gravy, toad in a hole sammy, and chilaquiles, I actually couldn't finish everyone's plates. Though maybe not the most exciting biscuit or flavorful carnitas you've had, everything was simple, straightforward, and delicious. 

Come here to eat away your hangover/sorrows/Monday scaries while adding to your insta story."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Nice place to have breakfast in Santa Barbara. Good food and great service. We had Classic Eggs Benedict(The avocado one), it was just awesome. It's one of my favs now, do try it out if you plan to visit."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Good food that goes far beyond what you would expect in what looks like a diner, not to mention a decent selection of beer and wine. I don't know how anyone could complain about the service here. The waiters and waitresses help each other out, and I've never had to wait for anything."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Wow this place is gorgeous 
Great new interior 
Had wonderful coffee and key lime pie 
Great service from Ronda 
Delicious food 
Linda and I had a wonderful time 
The menu  includes chicken and waffles 
I am coming back for that 
In same shopping area as skin deep 
That place really rocks 
Good advice on skin care 
Great products"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Had breakfast here as
It was suggested as a great breakfast place, well my opinion after only one visit is it is ok, not so special but ok. I had a breakfast sandwich as it seemed about the only different item on the menu as the other items are your basic American breakfast stuff and it was ok. Really would have preferred that the eggs yoke was hard so that as you bite into it the yoke spread down your chin The menu is pretty basic and seems pretty good if that is what you are looking for."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"When I rate something I have 4 foolproof methods to make sure a place is really worth the 5 stars I want to give it. First is ambiance. The ambiance here is fantastic. The music was good but not loud and the lighting and overall decor was great too. Number 2, cleanliness. It was very clean. 3, service. The service was awesome! They are a fun group of people who are very skilled at their jobs! And 4 the food. The food here is great! A nice condense menu but with a wide variety of choices. The food was excellent and the portions were definitely enough to stop even the hungriest stomach in its tracks. Such a good place!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I never leave this place hungry.  Super satisfying food from all spectrums - if you're a health nut you can find something here, as well as totally decadent comfort food.  The remodel a few years ago did wonders for the space and the staff are super friendly."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I really need y'all to use SEASONING. I ordered country fried steak and had to put salt and pepper on everything. I don't know why the restaurants in SB are so against seasoning, it blows my mind. The gravy was so bland. It was like eating flour paste. Their biscuits and potatoes are good and the eggs are cooked okay. But again, salt and pepper is your friend; please get closer to it. Also, I've never had a bland apple pie so I'm amazed this was as bad as it was. I'm really confused by these reviews, but also not really since this seems to be a theme in this area. If you like food that is horribly unseasoned and basic, this is the place for you. But it seems like such a huge waste of ingredients and effort just for it all to fall flat in the end. Seriously, tell your cooks to add salt, pepper, garlic, onions, SOMETHING."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Nothing out of this world but the breakfast is pretty good. Your typical breakfast and very close to Motel 6
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I had an amazing experience here today. I've eaten here several times for breakfast and it's always been delicious but today the scrambled eggs were over cooked and had a burnt taste throughout.  Outside of when my plate was delivered, the server never checked on me even though she walked by several times. When she delivered my bill I let her know about the eggs and asked her to let the cook know. The manager/owner came over and introduced himself and apologized for my experience and said they would take care of it. I expected a reduction in the bill but he covered the whole thing. Way more than I expected!  Will I be going back?  For sure!!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,This spot was open on New Year's Day! Wahoo a good find! I got the two eyed toad sandwich with hash browns and it was delicious! A perfect breakfast spot- we did a pick up order and customer service was friendly. It's nice supporting a local business. The portions are nice and big so I was able to save half for later! I I'll be coming back - hash browns were amazing!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Stopped here on recommendation from bartender at Brophy Bros. Started with the best cinnamon roll for the table and had carnitas chilequiles. Hubby had the chicken fried steak with home fries. Loved all the flavors! The atmosphere was great with old school music playing overhead. Service was great and all the staff were helpful and welcoming!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Great classic diner with more healthy options than other diners in town. Highly recommend! Great staff, food, and environment."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,My go to spot for breakfast while I was working in Santa Barbara! Food is delicious and staff is extremely friendly!
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,This place is one of my favorite breakfast spots! My two favorite options are the chicken and waffles or the chilaquiles! These two plates will not let you down! Also the large portions will leave you content and with left overs! Why not! Another amazing part is that they serve mimosas! The only down part is that they do tend to get super busy and the wait can be excruciating.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"UPDATE:  I really appreciate management reaching out after my previous experience.  We went back on a busy Sunday and had a much more positive experience.  Food was excellent, service was attentive, and it seemed like Staff genuinely cared and wanted to provide excellent service despite the busy mid-morning rush.  Looking forward to coming back here again! :)

Party of 5, came in on 4th of July weekend so it was pretty busy, and as expected, the service was super slow, but with very friendly and welcoming staff.  Ordered the chicken fried steak with hashbrowns.  The chicken was burnt and barely had any gravy on it and it came with country potatoes instead of hashbrowns.   My wife ordered a side of scrambled eggs with her hotcakes but the eggs never came.  My friends ordered the burger breakfast and eggs benedict and according to them, they were very good.  Definitely will give this place another chance - on a non-holiday weekend and ordering different things on the menu.  I'm hoping to give them a better rating on my next visit."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Breakfast was excellent and the service was friendly and efficient. They've set up an expanded outdoor dining area in the parking lot and it was very pleasant. When we arrived it was almost empty and 15 minutes later it was packed with a line forming, so your best bet is just to drive by and check it out."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"A local favorite with solid service that's very friendly and accommodating. And, they serve good diner food. We've been there several times for breakfast & lunch. (They're only open until 2:30 pm.) I adore their hash browns, they're crispy & cooked well. Plus, they make crispy bacon. The eggs taste buttery. 

My husband is a fan of their gravy; and, their lunch sandwiches are huge. But, if you don't have a big appetite, Farmer Boy has a menu section for ""Smaller Appetites."" 

There's usually a line on the weekends, but it moves fast. There's also a large counter to sit at plus a few outdoor tables. Parking can be limited. Farmer Boy has diner decor & is extremely clean. It's super loud inside & if you're with anyone who uses a hearing aid sit close to them."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"We've been to Farmer Boy a couple of times and are never disappointed with the food! 
The first time we visited my partner asked for no bacon on their wrap because they don't eat pork and it arrived with bacon, so they made us another. It was quite unfortunate because I finished my meal before my partner started theirs. Beyond that hiccup, the service is always great and I find it to be my favorite breakfast spot in town. 

We are large on cinnamon rolls and have tried several around SB. This cinnamon roll was amazing!! So warm and buttery. We have placed this one at the top of our list!

The mimosas are OK for their price. Small and nothing to write home about. The coffee is nice and they are on it when it comes to refilling. 

This time we tried the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs Benedict with avo, tomato and spinach (California eggs Benedict). The chicken fried steak was amazing- such great flavor. My partner really enjoyed the eggs Benedict- I liked the flavor of the hollandaise. 

Looking forward to our next meal there!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Farmer Boy is a staple in Santa Barbara. Been coming here for years and the service as well as the food is always consistently tasty and great!! I highly recommend this place always!! To anyone and everyone. It's easy to make a plate vegan and or vegetarian. They will work with you.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Awesome spot for lunch after a long drive up the coast. Got a table straight away and it was setup well for Covid. 

Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with great suggestions on meals, portions and general everything.

Portions and the quality of the food was superb. We will be back when in SB next."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Very tasty food. The chorizo Breakfast burrito was very tasty. We learned that they make their chorizo from scratch in house. The Cinnabon was delicious, and enough to share between the three of us. The staff is super kind!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"We were able to eat outside and enjoy our meal.  Jessica was super attentive and Mike  made sure we had everything we needed for our party of four.  The biscuits and gravy, Chilliquilles, bacon and eggs and the two eyed toad sandwich were all excellent.   Everything was super clean and tables were spaced appropriately.  We will definitely go back!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Farmer boy was peaceful, servers were friendly and prompt. Decor was clean, tidy, with a 50's counter and modern photo prints. Booths even had USB charging ports! We liked the 180+ catsup bottle display. The salmon burger and salad were great as were the fish tacos. The coffee was fresh and hot and went well with the warm apple pie. Price was very reasonable. Overall a great experience and we will be back."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Quintessential breakfast. Only diner in Santa Barbara. Try the avo-eggs Benedict & waffles.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Great food but worst OJ in town... Menu says ""fresh OJ "" wtf that's false advertising... I ended up paying $9 after tip and tax for a 99 cent OJ of fake canned/Tropicana/Minute Maid airline or Denny/MCD type OJ. Definitely not fresh nor pressed. C'est se foutre du monde ça. This is the garbage mass produced low cost loaded with artificial sugars OJ you buy in supermarkets. Definitely not Naked or Odwalla where you have pulp. If you want real OJ go to Jeannine's, The Shop or Tre Lune/D'Angelos. Now for good the Mediterranean & Baja scramble & omelette are phenomenal and the diner atmosphere & decoration is great as is service very nice/professional. This feels like a real classic American diner that you get on east coast or in Midwest and always has. Only one in SB now that Essau's is gone. Worker Bee in Carp is phenomenal old school diner too highly recommend. Momma bear would bring me here as a kid after school with my nerd folder organizer box in 80's for chocolate milkshakes at the counter, they had best in town. They still have real milkshakes made with those special classic blenders here so that's great. This is under new ownership from group that owns Brophy. I love all their restaurants but this OJ here has to go. Also my toast was served cold. The food is very good just disgusting OJ, not fresh at all and way overpriced. This was always a true locals spot and still has that vibe so that's a good thing. The new owners did a great job respecting the history of restaurant while also modernizing it. This is one of oldest eateries in town with Joe's. Nostalgia 101."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"The last time I ate at the old Farmer Boy predates my existence on Yelp, and it looks like I've been on here since 2007. You can infer my opinion of the diner from that. But just in case: I distinctly remember my dining companion having a large hair in his butter, which he pointed out, and the returning dish simply had the hair picked out and the pat of butter flipped upside down. So...if that's what was needed to keep menu costs cheap, I don't mind paying a couple dollars more. But that's the old Farmer Boy.

The new Farmer Boy is all cleaned up, and bright and tidy! It was a Monday lunchtime and all tables were filled, with a few seats open at the counter. We had a meatloaf sandwich and the chicken and waffles, and were very pleased with both.

The chicken is fried to order, it'll take 12-15 minutes. Its coating is zippy, as is the chile-spiked syrup. It's $11 for a Brussels style Belgian waffle and two large fried wings. An additional order of the chicken is $4. 

The other lunch fare is in the $10-12 range, on par with most restaurants. On my visit, the other patrons had the full range of young and older people, and I ran into family friends from the San Roque area. Everyone was friendly, the food was hot and good. I'm a fan. 

The old Farmer Boy will forever be associated with Mary Birdie, and that woman really scared me. May she rest in peace, along with the old restaurant."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"I visited Santa Barbara this weekend, excited to ty out and support some local spots. We were very understanding of the wait, but their host was very unorganized and unfriendly."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Finally had the chance to try this place for brunch! This is a good option on upper state if you don't want a Dennys atmosphere. It's in a tiny shopping strip so parking is definitely easy to miss, but you can easily park in one of the cross streets. 

Since I came a little after breakfast ended, they had a few breakfast options but mostly focused on a lunch menu, but they were happy to serve me a plate of chicken fried steak anyways. My buddy had ordered a chicken and waffle plate, which they offered in either wing or chicken tender form. 

We found it satisfying but not entirely impressive. If you're craving an LA chicken and waffle-style plate, you'll find it underwhelming, but whatever in SB will get the job done. My chicken fried steak was good, but it was soooo small.

It was fun to eat here, and service was incredibly nice, but if you're really trying to chow down for breakfast, break your wallet here or go to another diner."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Keep that coffee flowin' Kip! Now, usually I'm a cream and sugar kind of guy, but let's be honest, I could loose a few pounds, so I'm cutting back on the sugar, and I'm watching my sodium intake. I went with the kids scramble, and a black coffee. 
The music is always on point at Farmer Boy. Everything from The Beach Boys, to Donovan. 
Meal was on point!
5/5, talk about service with a smile"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I could only wish other restaurants could equal half of this incredible service. I was amazed. Greeted at the door, shown to a table of my choosing , water and coffee on the table within a couple minutes, and continual attention to make sure everything was alright, without being intrusive. 
I ordered a simple breakfast and it was good. I'm going to keep coming back because it is such a pleasure to be taken care of so well."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Pure crap. Just left there after ordering a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich and a hamburger with no pickles or onions. Instead of a BLT they put in another burger, and they put all the junk all my hamburger that I didn't want. Shame on me for not checking the box. And to top it off the two hamburgers were stone cold and on eatable. Should be zero stars"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Mmmmm. When the night before was a shit show and you just need Diner Food to feel better. This is the place.  
So good. Coffee fill ups every 5 min. Great service. 

Food was great!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I have lived in Santa Barbara for 10 years now, and for some reason, I have never been to Farmer Boy.  Boy have I been missing out!!!  Went with a friend for a late breakfast and it was fantastic!  It's a wonderful old-fashioned diner, complete with a fountain bar and bar stools!  We sat outside, because of COVID, but that was nice, too.

We had an omelet with sausage - which they make themselves, and it has fantastic flavor!  It was mixed with sauteed vegetables and some cheddar cheese.  Bit of sour cream on top and WOW!  I had mine with hash browns, which were perfectly done and a choice of toasted breads.

My friend had a scramble with lots of green veggies and she said it was fabulous!  She opted for the 'home fries'.  They weren't just 'fries' - they were perfectly twice-cooked roasted potatoes!  Believe me, next time I will get that!!

Our waitress told us that the eggs benedict (either traditional or veg) were fantastic, and that's my next order!  And the lunch menu looked fantastic, too.

I will definitely be back!  So sorry I missed enjoying this place for the past 10 years, but I will make up for lost time now!!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,I highly recommend the chilaquiles-- best ever. Nick the GM is also super pleasant and obviously loves taking care of his customers.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Farmer Boy restaurant has a simple setup: good food, huge portions, good service, good atmosphere.

The throwback of chrome, formica, bright lights and young people quick stepping plates of perfectly cooked food to the tables creates an atmosphere of anticipation and excitement for enjoying the great food we all enjoyed in the 60's... er, if you were around in the 60's to enjoy that sort of thing... and if not, check out Farmer Boy!  Real food.  Real service.

Tables have electrical outlets with usb ports!  How is that for a thoughtful attention to detail?  Charge your devices while you enjoy your meal.

Farmer Boy is a place one will return to again and again simply because it's a 5 star experience: food, atmosphere, portions and service."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Excellent service! Ordered a surprise birthday treat to be delivered to a friend (because covid) and Jessica was great about packaging it up and including a candle to make it special.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Well we're back in town again visiting our daughter and son-in-law and granddaughter.
 And of course we had to stop by Farmer boys for breakfast.
Once again they surprised us with the size of the meal, the wonderful textures and flavors, &  reasonable price.
I had the biscuits and gravy and my wife ordered the light breakfast which included scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, and hash browns.
It was actually so much food we decided to split each of our meals with each other and had a wonderful breakfast!
My only regret is that we live so far away, because we would eat here more often for sure.
And you should too!
Dave from Indio"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"I grew up in Santa Barbara but I now live in the Santa Ynez Valley so I only get down to SB every so often during the breakfast hour. 

Over The last 50 years I have tried many breakfast spots in Santa Barbara and Goleta and I can tell you emphatically, the best down home, all you can eat dishes, are to be found at the Farmer Boy!

The service is outstanding in this place which has been there since 1958 ...it's like a little time capsule back to when quality AND quantity along with outstanding service were foremost.

Stop in and say hi to Mike, the manager, as friendly and professional a restauranteur you will find anywhere. And think about trying the Santa Barbara Omlet with the home fries.

Bon appetit!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,negative,"Time to do yet another scathing (but accurate review). So Farmer ‍ Boy  has this (new) feature where you can use an iPad at their entrance to check in. So I did the whole check-in situation and patiently waited. The wait time was about accurate, I have to say. It's the experience once we were seated that was less than enjoyable. First of all (and I know the staff had little to no control over it). In the corner table, there were about 10 super loudly obnoxious kids talking so loud that I could barely keep my ears from exploding. 2 parents showed up about 30 minutes later to hush them up. The damage was done. Things were too loud and went on for too long. The waiting for the food was what took really long (over 30 minutes to get our meal). I overheard the server blaming on something happening in the kitchen but I didn't buy it . Overall, the experience was nothing to write  home about but it was to write a Yelp review about. I'm giving it 3 stars  overall experience. I would give 2.5 stars if I could. Yelp does not allow 1/2 star ratings. Disclaimer: I am satisfied with the help of the server and the man refilling our coffee  and water. They were very helpful and deserve kudos from the restaurant owners and a raise."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,Great breakfast joint and kid friendly! Good priced food and ingredients are fresh.  Our favorite breakfast place so far! The wait is never more than 10 minutes. We highly recommend this restaurant.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"This is hands down the best breakfast spot we've been to! Ordered the Belgian waffle, the breakfast burger with extra crispy hash browns and a cinnamon bun and it was hard to put our forks down the whole meal! Additionally, the service was excellent. Hard to find good food AND good staff these days. Will absolutely recommend to any friends or family coming through the area, and certainly adding it to our own must haves when we come back to SB! Thanks!!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"If anything, get the home fries (potatoes) for breakfast. They're the best that I have ever had; nicely seasoned throughout, good crisp. I wish I had the recipe. 
Busboys are not only professional but also friendly, happy and respectful. 
Every waitress has a good knowledge of the menu and can make appropriate recommendations should you want a substitution.  Coffee, water, and hot tea are checked on for refills. The cinnamon roll is about 6"" wide so it's enough to split. 
Restaurant is very clean, as well as the restroom. 
Noise can be a little loud but when you have so many people coming in for one of the best breakfasts in town, it's expected. The tables in the back can be moved to accommodate larger parties. 
Very family-friendly, dogs okay outside. 
It's not a huge venue; just an unpretentious diner tucked into the corner of a strip mall on the north side of town.  I would have it no other way.  The food???????

Always excellent. Fresh ingredients. Nothing stale or turning. 

I write this review with a heavy heart because they deserve the accolades; however, I do not look forward to the day when I have to ""wait to be seated "". 

God bless you, Farmer Boy!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,It was a Lil wait to get seated. Went here week b4 vday. Food was in small portions but very filling. Just sooo good I wanted more has n everything. If they had a 2 of this plate I would pay. It also came with a grwat locally made roll. It did take the waitress a long while for us to get check. I was ready to go n didn't enjoy waiting.
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Breakfast was so good. I ate some of my husbands eggs Benedict, I regret not ordering it. My breakfast was great. But his was bomb!"
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"Really nice service here 
Good job on the modern diner look.
Pies on display. Bright and happy counter. Great comfy booths and individual tables. 
Ample food. Come hungry! Straightforward, arrives quickly 
I just wish they had more real diner prices. It is a bit expensive and nothing is organic. 
Always really busy but you'll be seated in a jiffy."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"They're back, and they're better than ever. I couldn't be more excited to still have this spot in town. 

This was my family's go-to breakfast spot when I was a kid. I remember the good service, good food, and a restaurant that deeply needed a cleanup and an update. The new Farmer Boy certainly delivered. 

I love the fresh yet retro vibe, and that the upgrade allowed for much of the 1950s style of the interior to remain the same. Service is still just as good, prices are reasonable, and there's always still a line out the door on a Sunday morning. 

I recently tried their new Chicken and Waffles entree and must say that it was pretty darn good. The coffee is still as strong and as fresh as I remember, and you can't forget their amazingly large cinnamon rolls that put this establishment on the map. Very yummy. 

If you're in the upper State area and looking for a solid breakfast spot, give Farmer Boy a try - but make sure to set aside a bit of time for waiting."
7IdIGemGZodDAA_9mJCigA,Farmer Boy,American,positive,"It's your average diner, so you will know what to expect - large portion food and decent coffee being refilled each time you make awkward eye contact with the waiter if your cup is almost empty. I had the chicken and waffles because I hate myself. But jokes aside, it was my first time trying chicken and waffles, and it tasted great to me! Granted, I don't have a lot of experience in the chicken and waffles realm, so I would take my review on it with a grain of  salt (deep fried salt). Overall, everyone working here is super friendly and the atmosphere is very reminiscent of a 1950's diner, which I definitely wasn't alive to witness but have always found it endearing regardless. There's a wall of heinz ketchup if you're into that. They serve certain breakfast items on the menu all day, so you can order ""brunch"" at 1 pm after rolling out of bed at 12 pm on a Saturday ""morning"" (ha, that wasn't me what?). Great place, great music, but you may regret eating a lot when you meander outta here (and whether or not that's a bad thing is completely subjective)."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c'est la vie. 

The prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.

I like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. 

The service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.

My Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. 

All that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Just discovered this place and I already love it more than any other Thai place i've tried in SB! Amazing customer service and the food is even better. The management is absolutely wonderful, they saw me waiting for my food to come out and brought me a complimentary thai tea. Try them out for lunch as they have great deals and it's right in the middle of State so you can do a little shopping while you wait (or call ahead if you're in a rush). Took about 10 minutes for fresh pad thai"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,I don't know why this place got lower ratings! It is amazing! Food is flavorful. Some of the best Thai food I've ever had. The staff is friendly and the food comes out fast and hot. The fried rice is excellent and so is the green curry. Worth a stop in!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Food here is mediocre, not great and not that bad. The pad thai had too much carrots mixed in with it, imo. My pineapple fried rice was ok. Boyfriend's spicy noodles were ok as well. I am visiting from San Francisco where there are a ton of excellent Thai restaurants so I can be a bit picky. I suppose this is good enough for Santa Barbara. Maybe go here if you are really craving Thai, but pass if you are looking for a memorable meal."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The food here is greatbut kinda expensive. The curry noodle is kinda salty, but I recommend the vege fried rice, it is really good. The place is kinda small so if you decide to go better call for reservation."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Don't let the size of the place fool you!  It's tiny with small tables and you'll have to twist your way around the chairs to get to the back corner, but the food is great.

I really appreciate that the rice they served with the curry was a good hefty helping and not dry like other places.  The curries are really rich with flavor...so good!  The price is pretty much about $10-12 per person on average for a standard plate.  It goes up a bit for the more fancy add-ins.

And for those of you who can't handle spicy too well like me, don't forget to request it mild because they won't ask you how you like it and it'll come served with a kick like it's supposed to (still yummy though...just order two more glasses of water lol).  We ordered the pumpkin curry, pineapple curry, and pad thai.

Love the food, but the venue is pretty cramped."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Spicy noodle (drunken noodle) was very good. Both of our curries: red curry with chicken and Panang curry with beef left a lot to be desired. They were runny and the taste was off. 

My Thai iced tea was good. 

Service was mediocre. It was very challenging to get her attention. She told us we could each get glasses of water but only brought one. She brought a second glass for another person after the meal was over. She would never make eye contact or refill drinks."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"No appetizers on the lunch menu, only choices were noodles, fried rice or curry. No bottled water, only iced tea, soda or Thai drinks. Food was a bit bland. Positives for vegetarian dishes had the best mix of vegetables for a vegetarian curry. No parking on street in front. Would not come here again."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I love this restaurant. Food is is really, really good. Everything about the meal was excellent, including the friendly and welcoming greeting at the door. What a pleasure to rediscover this old gem."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Eggplant basil & mozzarella appetizer is delicious. Would definitely go back. Good idea to make reservation though. Small restaurant.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We found this place by walking around Hungry.... and it was a great experience.

We enjoyed their Tom Kai soup with the Pumkin Curry (Mine had Tofu and My companion's had Shrimp and Chicken).  It was all delicious and filling.  

My companion had the Jasmine Tea  and I had the Oolong tea with our meal.  

Their service was great even though they were busy.

When ever we go that way, I know where I want to eat."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Delish! The Pad Thai were perfect spicy. Only complaint is the Shu Mai was a bit cold. A definite repeat.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We had the joneses for authentic Thai food, but whenever the word ""Thai"" is in the name of the restaurant, I get worried that the food may be dumbed down to american standards.
Well, my fears were unfounded as we found the two dishes we tried, chicken satay and pad thai, authentic with a complex sweet and savory and spicy flavor.
the Thai Tea was also excellent."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Absolutely incredible.  Best Thai food in town.  The peanutty Masseman, the papaya salad, the spicy sole and the scallops pha pha are great.
If you feel like grabbing some Thai dont waste your time with any of the others in town.  I have lived here for 30 years and have tried all.  Zen Yai has consistently had quality and taste..."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is a really really great Thai restaurant. 
We are there last night, and we're gonna go back again tonight. 
Amazing"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,This place was yummy! The pad Thai was really good!! My curry was pretty good also but spicy!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Located on Lower State, Zen Yai is a cozy little restaurant that almost always has a wait. Although Santa Barbara is not known for fantastic Thai food, Zen Yai hits the spot when you're craving Thai food. I am particularly fond of their Panaang Curry with Chicken as its a nice and spicy dish. I've tried several other dishes as well, but the panaang curry is still my favorite. The curry is spicy but it also has depth and the green beans are still nice and crispy. I usually like Pad Thai, but I find that pad thai at zen yai can be a little inconsistent. Sometimes its great and other times the noodles are overcooked. I do, however enjoy the Spicy Fried Rice - big surprise! I LOVE spicy food! 

The ambiance is nice for a date and the service is usually pretty friendly :) Although there's Thai food in Goleta, I'll gladly make the drive downtown to visit Zen Yai :)"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Delicious pad Thai and pumpkin curry, I will skip I
Thai iced coffee and get a Thai iced tea next time"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Service and food was spectacular as always. I've been coming here for ten years. I'll be coming back for ten years to come. The decor is just my style. The food is always fresh and tasty (spicy). The staff is always extremely nice. It's small and quirky, but that's what makes this place so lovable. The Pumpkin curry.... Well any of their curries are a MUST try. If you order spicy, it WILL be SPICY.... So be prepared. If you're dining in, the two top by the window is the perfect people watching spot. Be prepared to see some weirdos. Also, if you're on a date, after your date, if you're feeling a little excited and adventurous from all the foreign spiciness there's a specialty shop just a few doors down that can help add some spice to your love life. This is the perfect location for a fun first date, ordering take out, or dining alone. The food never disappoints. I've loved everything I've ever eaten here."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"decent thia food plus if you go during happy hour you can save some money

Avoid the dessert it was way too expensive for the serving they give you"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Fairly standard Thai food. Entree prices around $11-12. Nightly
specials on the wall. The spicing is on the mild side. Generous servings. The Poorman's noodles has much meat as large flat noodles. Beer prices are a bargain. Service is friendly and faultless. The decor is very pleasant and creative."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Walking in this little restaurant, my first thought was ""smells delicious!"" The waitress was attentive and continually asked us if everything was ok. Food was quick and tasty! Heard lunch specials were great as well so will be coming for lunch next!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"The food was pretty good but the staff couldn't have been more rude.  Maybe I would order take out, so as to avoid dealing with the staff, but I hear ""Your Place"" is just as good, if not better."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"We didn't even attempt to eat there since the wait for a table for two was 45 minutes. The hostess was super nice and we got takeout and took it back to our hotel. The food itself was pretty average, we had panang curry with beef, shrimp fried rice, and a drunken noodle dish. I wouldn't say it was bland, but certainly not as flavorful as Thai should be. A bit overrated, but maybe it is the best in SB."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"July 2018 update:
Soon after we last dined there (see January review), a renovation took place.  We were eager to return anticipating the same consistent excellent food, service and ambience like we had many times over the past years.  The restaurant was full with the exception of couple of empty tables.  This is not unusual for Zen Yai.  The cosmetic make over was obviously different.  While seated and waited for 20 minutes just for water, we noticed that most of the tables were waiting for their water too with no hint of  food to come.  We noticed a change of staff and manager also.  We wonder if the owner sold the restaurant to someone else, and changed the cooks as well????  Because they were definitely not keeping up with any of the customers just sitting and waiting.  Two tables finally got there food and we wondered how long they waited.  We decided we didn't want to spend the next undetermined hours to find out as we wanted to enjoy the rest of the evening doing more than just waiting for food.  We're not at all fond of the new make-over either.  Before the ambience was eccentric in a fun eclectic way.  Now it's cookie cutter bland, not at all interesting.  For now, we'll see if more consistent good reviews will come about on their food, then we'll give it another try."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Ordered the curry noodles and the vegetable fried rice. Both were godawful... No no no flavor. The curry was not at all like a Thai curry, more like a bland salty sauce. The rice!! Horrendous!!! Was just rice, oil, and veggies tossed in a wok. Once again, no flavor. Service was tolerable. Really have no idea what Santa Barbara citizens (who have an abundance of great restaurants) see in this place!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My highest rating is four stars - unless I'm rating fine dining.

Zen Yai is becoming my favorite Thai spot in SB.

The Basil Tofu dish is very delicious, what a great flavor! It's more like a mock-chicken, if you are in the know of vegetarian ""fake meats"". Even my carnivorous husband seems to prefer this dish.

The restaurant is small and can get warm, but the service is so friendly and efficient, that it ends up being fine. I am also a big fan of their appetizers - vegetarian egg rolls and the tofu satay.

Park on the street and walk, or there are a couple paid lots - one on Guttierez and the other closest on Cota Street.

Enjoy!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"This is a great place if you are looking for a trendy and cute restaurant. It is great for cocktails, esp given the location. However, the food is not authentic thai, it is very americanized. So, if you are looking for real Thai food, this isn't the best place for it."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Being on State Street and my bad luck with Asian food here in Santa Barbara, I was very pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here. But after trying the Blue Owl that uses this same location for late night dining on the weekends, I really wanted to try it.

My friend came up to visit and we had the pad see you and the fried rice, both with tofu. I'm generally a big meat eater and have at least some dead animal on my plate. But tonight I veered from my normal tendencies. The food was delicious! 

I can't wait to go back and try something else."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,My favorite Thai place in SB. Try their Chicken Satay and Masman Curry
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Great food 
Reasonable prices
Nice location
Friendly and prompt service
Food came out quickly 

We had the Tom kha soup and massaman curry."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"YUMMY! I love Thai food! This is a small spot on State Street that is pleasing to the senses. The red walls, artwork and other pieces give it a nice ambiance. I particularly liked the specials written on a large piece of rolling paper (think paper towels). They can rip out the old sheet, pull down for a clean sheet to write the new specials on. Creative! The hostess was a bit rude but our waitress was super sweet. 

Ordered Tom Yum, Beef Pad See Ewe and Pineapple Curry with brown rice. All very flavorful, spicy dishes that kept me eating and eating. We had the mango sticky rice for dessert but that wasn't too good. The mangos were amazing but they used black sticky rice and didn't cook it long enough. It was dry and hard still. But nevertheless, the other dishes and overall feel of the restaurant still deserves 4 stars from me. I left full, happy, satisfied and wishing I could fit more in my tummy."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Hands down the best Thai in SB, with some of the friendliest service you will ever find.  Our family eats here every Tuesday after the farmer's market, and the staff is so warm and welcoming it is like coming home.  They are always sweet to the children, and remember everything about us even when we have been gone for weeks due to travel or bad weather.  The food is also exceptional (Poor Man's Noodles with pork is my ATF), and fresh specials are a nice treat.  Finally, the food is consistently good, which is an area many restaurants in SB fall down on...  So for great food, great service, and reasonable pricing, stop by Zen Yai."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Excellent food. Great staff. Stopped here on our road trip from San Diego to San Francisco. As a Thai food aficionado I highly rate this restaurant!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Mediocre food. We've traveled the world in search of great Thai food and this is a poor offering. Nice decor though.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Best Thai in Santa Barbara hands down. The only place that's better is Westwood Thai in LA!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Delicious Pad Thai.  That is all.

PS - Very cute location, small little dining area, and super good deal on the SB main drag.  Perfect pre-bar dinner."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,I liked the place. but taste is average. I think the quality of scallops are bad. my father ate a sea food plate but it was  incredible spicy. hi likes spicy food but this was a bit out of taste. we 2 spent 95 including tip.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My go-to dishes by which I judge my Thai restaurants: tom yum goong, and green curry. Zen Yai did a great job with both, but more importantly, they complied with our ""Thai spicy, not American spicy"" request! Definitely exceeded my expectations, when I'm in the area I'll definitely be back. Bonus points for the John Lennon artwork and the nice local wine list - it all made for a comfortable atmosphere, not trendy, not divey, just right."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I came with a large party and they were very accommodating when I called before hand to make a reservation. The restaurant is pretty small and tight with a dark atmosphere. The service was pretty fast and the staff was very polite. We ordered quite a few dishes, but the chicken satay stood out. It was very moist and flavorful. All the other dishes such as the papaya salad, pad thai, pad see ew, green curry, and tom yum were decent. The green curry was particularly disappointing, it was basically flavorless besides the hint of spice and off-putting coconut flavor. Not to mention the chicken was extremely dry. The tom yum soup was extremely spicy even though we asked for it to be mild. Overall an average thai restaurant with decent prices. If you are in the Santa Barbara area I would recommend TAP thai over this place."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I just woke up and want this shit for breakfast. My go to Thai, they can accommodate to veganism really easily and are super nice about it. The waitress is such a sweetheart and always the same girl. She's super quick to serve you and always deserves a wonderful tip! Just remember the hours cause they're kinda odd and I often go on the wrong days. Overall, wonderful place and great food."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Their Thai food is the best I've had yet. The service was a bit off and so was the appetizer but the pad thai, duck curry, and tom yum really made up for it. It is a bit pricey but what could you expect when you're in Santa Barbara."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,I don't know if it was because I was really hungry or the food is just that good but my meal here was really enjoyable and satisfying.. It was a last minute decision and the place was close to closing but we still got in... we ordered the pumpkin curry and drunken noodle.. both delicious. i love thai curry and I was even more happy when I saw this restaurant served pumpkin curry.. I think we had to pay for our tea.. but it was so cold that night that it was worth it for me at the time.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Nice lil restaurant with veryyy nice staff. Very good pad thai. Soup tom kha was good too. Just the silver glasnoodle salad was a lil boring.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is a good little Thai place on State Street. Stepping inside you'll find it to be pretty small with few tables and seats, which surprisingly adds a homely element like you would get stepping into it's counterpart in DTLA/Chinatown; except it's in the middle of State St. Really good flavors and reasonable portions. It was on-point!

I recommend calling head because it gets really busy."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Unfortunately, Zen Yai's Pad Thai seems to have deteriorated over time. The last several times we got it, we were disappointed. It definitely isn't bad, by any means, but it isn't great the way it used to be. Zen Yai is no longer our go-to Thai restaurant."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Wonderful food.  We enjoyed the rice and mango dessert.  A must place to visit.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Really Good Thai Food!! We had the Chili Mint Chicken Plate with Brown Rice, and the Pad See-Ew Plate. Both very amazing! One of the better Thai Places. 

Service was very prompt and pleasant also."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I've been here twice and both times the food and service were great. Without a doubt, this is my favorite Thai place in Santa Barbara (though that might not be saying too much...), even if it was slightly awkward with a homeless guy camped out outside the window (beside which we sat) looking in at the John Lennon portrait on the far wall. This last time, my friend and I shared the stuffed eggplant appetizer, Zen Yai Online noodles with veggies, and yellow curry with chicken. It was plenty for two people and we managed to finish it off.

As others have said, the actual restaurant is very small, but very cute and a lot of thought goes into the presentation of the food. If you know you'll be dining during peak times it'd be most considerate to call ahead for a reservation. (Maybe don't leave a message, cause they didn't get mine last time, though we got there early so it wasn't a problem."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"If you're looking for great Thai food in Santa Barbara - look no further than Zen Yai.  The panaang curry is amazing, the service is great and it's dirt cheap.  It's everything you want in a good Thai food spot and nothing you don't."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Must haves: zen Yai salad, smoked tofu stir fry, pumpkin curry, poor man noodles, sticky rice and mango"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Came here on a mini-vacation in Santa Barbara.  My husband had the pumpkin curry (since everyone on Yelp seemed to love it) and he really liked it.  I had the praram rongsong, which was about 85% spinach and 15%.  It should definitely be in the 'salad' portion of the menu.  Usually the ratio is reversed.  It was good, but I was a little disappointed.  

For an appetizer, we couldn't get egg rolls or calamari because their fryer was broken, bummer.  The thai iced teas were good.  I'd like to go back to try a different dish because the quality was good."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Nothing to complain about here!! Solid taste, large portions, and great service. I tried the pad Thai and pad see ew and both were really good quality. Clean and cute restaurant too. I really hope business goes well here so I can come back during my time in college."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Zen Yai is the best Thai food in Santa Barbara, and one of my favorite restaurants in SB, period. The food always tastes fresh, and not as greasy as other Thai food can sometimes be. The Zen Yai Online Noodles are amazing - I get it everytime. Love their Thai Iced Tea - not too sweet. The staff and owners are always friendly and pleasant. Great ambiance. Great date spot. 
@Lauren C. - it's a small space and they only have so much room to work with."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Went here for dinner last night upon a recommendation from a friend! It was just lovely!!! Everything full of flavor and perfect amount of heat! 
Ordered: shrimp/pork shu mai -I am Cantonese so I can be really picky about my beloved dumplings. These were on point!!!! 

Egg rolls: crispy delicious filled with glass noodles and dipped in a sweet and sour sauce! Super yum! 

I had spicy noodle with chicken... perfect blend of spice and fresh veggies I ate the whole plate! 

Partner had the prik khing with chicken. He ate the whole thing and said it was full of flavor... 

Friend had the basil garlic with shrimp and gave me some shrimp to eat too. Spicy yummy and all super fresh! 

Best Thai I've had in a long time... Highly recommend 

The restaurant is quaint and decor is funky eclectic and would be great to bring a date! I found it to be quiet and romantic."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is a solid Thai place. I've been here twice and it was good both times.

For appetizers, I've tried the Duck Roll and the Egg Roll. For entrees, I've tried the Massaman Salmon and Pumpkin Curry. Everything I've had was really good and would recommend to others.

I highly recommend reservations because the space is small and the wait can be long."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Adorable atmosphere and most of all, the food quality is amazing, and inexpensive. Sold!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I think Zen Yai now holds the title for best Thai in SB for me. Ingredients were really fresh, and flavors were exciting. If you can get a seat (the venue is kind of small), definitely go here."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Chicken Panang curry was very good. Two of us split 2 entrees, 2 apps, and a large sake and it came to less than $50. I would definitely go again!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Don't understand what all the hype is about. After moving from the Bay Area and eating great Thai food, a friend suggested Zen Yai. Very disappointed. Normally I finish my plate, but couldn't at this place. Everything was either way too salty or bland. Stick to Tap Thai or Your Place Thai instead."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,First time here and the food was not memorable. The Thai flavor is not there at all compared to many other Thai restaurants.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We went here twice in one weekend... it was SOOOOOOOO GOOD!!! The service was great, fast and the portions were PERFECT. 

I had the param rongsong-- steamed spinach, peanut sauce and pork. Hubby had pad thai and sticky rice. The presentation was impeccable and the service was fast!!

I would HIGHLY recommend Zen Yai Thai Cuisine for anyone in SB!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Came here with my roommates and man-friend for dinner on a Sunday.  Not too busy and was seated quickly.  Mulled over the menu and ordered:

Pad Kee Mao (Spicy Noodles) - Spicy indeed!  Made the way I like, but lacked the huge slice of tomatoes I usually find. 

Seaweed Salad - Thrown off by the lettuce/arugula mix on top of the seaweed, but otherwise good 

Chicken Mussuman - Not the best mussuman I've had.  The curry had a spice that overpowered the coconut milk, which gave it a tangy aftertaste.  Tangy isn't good when I expect something rich or creamy.

Ate all this with jasmine rice and shared among four people.  Still managed to have left overs.

The restaurant is small, and by the looks could get crowded on a normal weekend.  Dim lighting for those who think dim equates to romantic, but people weren't too dressed up to eat here.  Overall, a nice place to grab some Thai food."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Delicious and excellent Thai food and despite its location, is very affordable. Three of us ate dinner for $60 (without alcohol) and we all enjoyed our food. There is something about their tofu and its prep that makes it different than other restaurants. We had pineapple curry with shrimp; fried tofu as an appetizer; glass noodle salad with chicken and shrimp; another tofu dish; and the funny-named Crouching Tiger salad that is just delicious steak, dressing and greens. All in all, a great meal in a small, cozy restaurant."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Right on State Street, we walked into this little gem of a place. It is dimly lit and looks family run. The food was fresh, hot and delicious. 

First, we started out with the Spring rolls and the plum sauce and the coconut veggie soup. The spring rolls were fresh, a touch on the oily side and the plum sauce was extremely sweet. The coconut soup was unbelievable. The veggies were cooked just right and the broth itself was amazing. The entrees were standard fare and we ensured we devoured every last spoon.

This brings us to the dessert. We ordered the fried banana and coconut ice cream. I've honestly not had anything like it before. The dessert itself was mild and not overpowering. It was also very light. The bananas had the perfect amount of crispiness and heat to them. This complimented the house made ice cream perfectly.

All in all, it was a great experience. I'll make sure I pay this place a visit when I come back. 

PS: Just a side note, my friend ordered a chicken entree and told me the chicken was not processed chicken but of higher quality. I'm a veggie so I don't really understand."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I'm afraid to share the good news, but this place is my go-to. Any day of the week, I can be in the mood for this delicious Thai cuisine. The larb always has that heat you love to hate. The pad Thai is exactly what you want it to be, and the curry is packing tons of flavor. 

Such a nice spot, get excited for a delicious meal in your future...."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Amazing Family Owed Thai Restaurant! I love the Thai iced tea! I also always get the Pad See Ew with beef. The vegetables are also so light and fresh. Not a ton of sauce. Doesn't feel heavy when you eat it. Always get the mango sticky rice if it's in season! I hope this place never closes!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Nope. Never again. 13$ for 8 bites of pad Thai. Never again. Menu pricing online is outdated. No thanks.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Came here with a small party and we had a really good time.  The food is really good and so is the atmosphere.  Would definately come back!  The pad thai was amazing as well as the stir fry tofu!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Disappointing chicken pad thai. Very dry and lacking flavor. I sadly wouldn't recommend this place. Fortunately i ordered take out, but the restaurant itself is quite small, cramped, and rather loud."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"We came in on a tip off from a co-worker in love with this place. We had really high hopes but were pretty let down. 

The best thing about this restaurant is the very kind staff. Not very attentive, but very kind. 

He ordered a tea that never came out, but was still on our bill. They happily fixed it but he went the whole dinner without his drink haha. 

I ordered the massaman curry with veggies and tofu. It had been a long time favorite Thai dish of mine but I was greatly disappointed with this one. The curry was a really strange sour taste, and I barely ate any of it at all. There was zero spice to it either. 

Husband got the Pumpkin curry with beef and shrimp. He expected a much better taste as well, but was let down. He said his was at least more flavorful than mine, but really wished they had asked how spicy we wanted our dishes. Neither dish was spicy at all. 

I see a lot of reviews hailing this as the best in SB. I am so sorry to have to vote differently."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Awesome food, small place. There are only 10 or so tables in this tiny restaurant, but the wait is well worth it. The food is delicious, the prices are fair, the portions are fair. 
The portions are decent, but the food is really great! 
I highly recommend the spicy fried rice with chicken and the pad thai. Yumm! 
The service is bleh though, nothing special. We had to ask for water after dying of thirst from the spicy fried rice, lol."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"WOW! 6 of us wear walking around down town Santa Barbara, and we found this nice clean looking Thai restaurant.........OMG! this was the best Thia restaurant I have ever been to......We started off with the Tom Kah soup,that was soooo good and the shimp red curry and brown rice,with some poorman noodles,and more other stuff.......I wish I lived here in Santa Barbara so I can come here offten......."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I don't know what I just ate, it was not good. I mean, I know what it was, some rice dish, but it lacked any real flavor, especially that Thai flavor, and it was just not good at all. It was also overpriced and $14. Why does this place have four stars today??? Do that many people in Santa Barbara have no taste??? I'm sorry but the food at this place is not good and you are missing out on what this truly amazing cuisine is!!!! Won't be coming back here"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,An average place for Thai food having lived in Los Angeles and East bay I know my expectation is high. This restaurant is in downtown prime location wiling dishes priced average $11. The portion could have been bit more. Ordered chicken pad see ew and green curry. The pad see ew was good but the green curry was bland and too watery. Bottom line won't be visiting this place again for thai food as there is too many other cuisine options in Santa Barbara. I will stay with my east bay restaurants for Thai food
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I was not very impressed with this place. I got the two things I always get at Thai places: green curry and pad thai.

Green curry: I feel like they use corn starch or something to thicken the curry because the consistency was icky and it didn't taste like other green curries I've had.

Pad Thai: the noodles were kind of sticky and gooey... not sure why. Also my friend and I ordered mild or medium spice I forget, but these noodles were flaming!!! I can handle spicy, it just wasn't what we ordered so it was kind of disappointing. It does depend on the chilis though because every day is different."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is one of my romantic, trendy favorites in SB, although the ingredients have slipped a bit, and the wait staff is unpredictable."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Zen Yai is our favorite place in town! The freshest real Thai veggies and the most pleasant service can be found here every time, and doesn't hurt that the two owners are always there keeping an eye on the place. They are two sisters, one in the kitchen and one on the floor. Their staff is like family and are some of the most hard working girls I've ever met!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My FAVORITE Thai place that I have ever been to..and I've been to a lot.

The restaurant itself is very small and intimate, so I wouldn't recommend it for big groups. They were however able to put together tables for a group of about 15-18 for my birthday, via reservation.

I've come here a number of times with my best friend and we always leave satisfied. We usually split an order of tom kha kai, pineapple fried rice, pad Thai, and any another noodle dish. The plates are large and we always have left overs. It's a great place to go for a date or to catch up with a few friends. Thai food can be expensive, but Zen Yai is moderately priced and is worth the splurge!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"very small resto, but we were able to get a seat right away. i had the yellow curry with chicken, which was perfectly spicey. i wish my nose weren't such a wimp. i really liked that the carrots weren't mushy and overcooked. but the chicken was a bit tough. 

there was a weird situation while eating. some drunk dude came in with a dog and started speaking very loudly about who owned the dog. well the dog owner was inside eating her meal.. there was a discussion how it's cold and one shouldn't leave the dog outside (true). the resto handled it nicely though. poor doggy."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"YUMMY!    My family and I were in the mood for Thai while strolling around downtown Santa Barbara one night, so I busted out my trusty Yelp app and found this spot.    We were seated right away, and the waitress was happy to let my dad and I split a plate.   The jasmine rice that came with my green curry was shaped into a pyramid, which I thought was very adorable!   Everything was wonderful--from the food to the service to the presentation--the only reason why I don't give this restaurant a 5 is because it's so small and you could literally bump elbows with a stranger at the next table.    I kept reading all the positive reviews on the pumpkin curry...which I'll have to try the next time I'm in the area again!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"fast and efficient service. the food was amazing, the best panang curry I've ever had! great soup. the atmosphere is nice too!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I was excited to come after all the great reviews but I ended up being quite disappointed. My mother got the rad na which contrary to one of the reviews was way too sweet. I got the veggie fried rice and my boyfriend got the basil fried rice. Both these dishes tasted fine and they had a lovely variety of vegetables.

What disappointed me the most was the service. We had four different people serve us and they ranged from very nice to outright rude. One of the waitstaff kept ignoring us everytime we tried to ask for the check. Food was alright, atmosphere was okay (a little on the dirtier side), but the service is the reason why I will not be returning."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Great service and delicious Thai food. Large selection of vegetarian options. Would definitely recommend this restaurant !!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Try the stuffed chicken wings and the curry duck. I've never been to Thailand but I've eaten Thai from coast to coast and this is about as good as it gets. Next time I go to Santa Barbara I will make it a point to eat here again.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I am vegan and I ate here with my father who is very much not vegan. We both loved the food. The menu has all the dishes you look for in Thai /pan Asian. I ordered a vegetable curry, which I ate ALL of and my dad ordered the bok choy with chicken stir fry which he loved. The egg rolls are delicious as well. The food is 5 stars. 

The service is also pretty good, though they were a little under staffed considering how full the restaurant was with customers. Only two people serving and hosting. That being said, we got our food right away and didn't have to wait much for anything, but you could sense how busy the waitress was. They were both working very hard.

The restaurant is smaller though not crowded. It looks very clean. The esthetic is very Thai with more of an artistic feel than most Asian restaurants. Some very pretty lights. It feels casual but is also intimate and has romantic lighting (on the darker side). 

I highly recommend and will be back!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"We went to this restaurant for lunch. Ordered Spicy chicken fried rice, panang curry and coconut soup. Portion was good, food was decent but service was horrible. Waitress had no smile, she didnt bother to come and ask if we needed anything. We had to get walk to waitress and ask for rice, water and bill."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"We came here on a sunday night and it was crowded inside, but no wait.  We ordered the vegetarian pad see yew and the chicken curry noodles with a thai iced tea and chrysanthemum tea.  The food itself was pretty good, nothing too impressive.  The service was mediocre, as we kept on having to flag down the waitresses to bring us more water, the bill, etc."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Pretty solid thai food with reasonable prices and good portions. I had the duck curry which is touted as one of the specialties of this place as pointed out by the other reviewers. Sweet, sour, and spicy flavors envelop your tongue with every bite, although their curry is a bit sweeter than curries I've had at other places. 

This place is small, so make reservations or come during non peak times. Also, get the thai tea!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The Amgen Bike race was in town..the heat was on and Zen Yai had NO A/C.
.But that did not stop us from enjoying creative fun Thai food.
We used the "" induce sweat with really hot food-trick..IT Worked.
We had a bit of wine open from happy hour and we know that this style of Rose would pair with certain Thai food ..the hot and sweet food was a ""marriage in heaven'
We shared with the Chef owner and he made us a fun "" not on menu"" dessert
REALLY enjoyed our meal
will return."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,I loved the iced Thai tea but the food felt like it came from the microwave. My cousin came back to the hotel throwing up from the spicy chicken noodles. She's a bit picky but I knew we just stuffed our faces with the food because we were so hungry. The taste was nothing I'm used to. I lived in Hawaii so maybe I developed higher standards for Thai or maybe I just love spicy food. I don't know but to me the food was not spicy it was sort of baby spiced like if they skipped or got stingy with spices. Like others mentioned the curry was runny. I ate it and took all the carrots out because it had way too much carrots. I recommend ask for super duper spicy or for hot sauce. I guess if you are desperate need of Thai food eat here other than that just skip this spot
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Great food a really fast and friendly service.  I loved this place.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Good food. The service wad OK. I really enjoyed the noodles. It's in a really good spot. It's small so don't expect to bring a big crowd but good for a nice date.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I have been here for both lunch and dinner. Love the atmosphere of the place. I loved their tom kha coconut soup. The eggplant salad was interesting, tasted botanical. Any way, this place is worth a try if you are in the mood for Thai food."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"This place used to be my go-to restaurant for Thai food. I think they changed chefs or something because it no longer has the authentic flavors. I always come here for the pad see ewe and the pad Thai. The last time I came here, the pad see ewe lacks flavor and the pad Thai has a strong ketchup flavor. Sad that I have to find a new Thai place."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Ok so the hubby and I are visiting SB for our 10 year anniversary. We are huge lovers of Thai food, after checking out the reviews we thought we would Try it.Man! was it not good at all. We had the Tom Kah which was way too milky, then we ordered ( feeling adventurous)  duck roll.... More like the yuck roll. It just tasted bad and it was wrapped in tortilla, what?!?! We ordered 2 orders of sticky rice. They only had one order left which was ok. We also ordered the spicy basil beef. The beef was grey and tasteless. All in all this was the worst thai food we have ever eaten. Happy Anniversary!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I love this place. Really good food. Really nice people. They will make things genuinely spicy if you ask them to. The regular menu is rather extensive and full of good things, and they always have some excellent specials. The staff is very friendly and service is always quick.

I wish they had more space, and I wish their beer list were more extensive. But this is hands-down the best Thai place in Santa Barbara."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is one of the best Thai food restaurants in Santa Barbara. The restaurant is small but it is cozy and nice that there aren't empty seats in it.  They do offer to-go.  I have gotten the Red Curry, Zen Yai Online Noodles, and the Shu-Mai chicken and shrimp.  I am excited to try more options.  They definitely know how to make yummy noodle dishes.  Way to go! I have not had a bad experience at Zen Yai yet and I look forward to my next ventures there."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I've been frequenting Zen Yai at lunch for the last year. It's still the best Thai restaurant in Santa Barbara. The staff are all very friendly and attentive, and don't seem to mind when splitting the bill with colleagues on our lunch break.

One thing that I have noticed is that the food seems to be better at lunch time than it does in the evening. I've taken the fiance here for dinner on several occasions and it just never seems to be as good as lunch.

Thai iced tea and Pad Thai is my go-to. Their soups are also very good."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Wir haben hier wirklich gut gegessen! Leider war der papayasalat alle :-( bedienung war okey! Das essen kam sehr rasch! War wirklich alles gut! Ginge hier wieder essen! Es ist angenehm nicht kalt nicht laut! Super!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,My boyfriend and I came in for lunch on a weekday and had a pretty unpleasant experience. There were small flies buzzing around inside the restaurant and there was only one employee and an angry older woman helping all the tables. The older woman stormed over and said 'what do you want' to take our order and when our food arrived she slammed our plates on the table and walked off. We ordered chicken pad Thai and shrimp curry noodles and the shrimp and chicken were both overcooked. Not to mention it costs an extra dollar for five small overcooked shrimp. After the food was delivered no one came to check on us or refill waters. We noticed the same with other tables who all had empty glasses and had to wave over the one employee to get boxes. We ended up having to go to the front and wait around to pay because we couldn't get our check. It's a cheap meal but I'm sure there are a lot of better options on state street to choose from.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"What an utter disgrace! I had high hopes bc the great reviews.. But was I wrong, the curry was too soupy & tasted like sewer water.. YUM!! Won't be coming again, but on the plus side I'll be shitting out this food ASAP"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"this used to be our favorite vegan/Thai  cafe  when visiting Santa Barbara. this time we ordered tofu and veggie  curry with rice. it was mostly tofu and just a couple  bites of veggies and the curry was not rich but watery and not that good...

won't be coming back"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Small but comfortable dining room. Tasty Pad Thai, Green beans with garlic and Massaman Curry (though we'd ask for it spicier next time), Eggplant stir fry was OK. Service was great. Family of five. Kids loved it.  Would like to see a longer beer selection although Santa Barbara Brewery is closeby..."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Finally, a casual asian restaurant that does not just taste like every other homogulated tourist-friendly asian joint. 

The food is delicious, authentic and the flavors are excellent.

I would venture to say that this is best Thai food in SB."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Amazing food!!! Great service, owner was such a  great host :) 

I recommend the pad see ew, papaya salad, pad thai and the chicken satay."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,I really enjoy Thai food and this small place is one of my favorite. I really enjoy the vergetarian options such as spicy vegetable soup. i would recommend this place.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,This place was pretty good - I liked the spring rolls.  The mango salad was much spicier than expected though - so watch out!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I love this place! My Thai friend recommended it to me and we went together. She said it was really authentic to Thailand. It was a month or so ago so I don't remember what we had, but it was incredible! The place is run by real Thai people and they spoke Thai with my friend and brought her a big spoon so she could eat the way Thai people do traditionally. It definitely doesn't look very appealing from the outside, but this little place has fantastic food and was not very expensive!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,New owner or management after the remodel. They still have the same chef apparently but I got the same dish as I always do (baby bok choi) it was subpar. It's more expensive and the decor is not great. There's just a bunch of Christmas lights. It has the atmosphere of a sorority girl's dorm room. I preferred the old zen yai.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Super delicious, ""non-traditional"" Thai (which can get derailed occasionally - spiced eggplant with mozzarella?) that manages to turn out innovative dishes featuring the best of Thai cuisine (ingredients and flavors) in a casual, intimate and trendy-ish (but not too) environment.  Must-have dishes include pumpkin curry, spinach with peanut sauce, smoked tofu salad with mango, and the mango with sticky rice for dessert.   Decent selection of wines by the glass.  Very reasonable prices."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Zen Yai is one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to. The decor is fun and very different from any other Thai restaurant I've been to. It's small and dark, which gives an intimate feel. Also, since it's so small it never gets obnoxiously loud and the service is great.

I love the food. It's spicy but not overly so, you can still taste the food. This seems to be very hard to master in Thai cooking. 

It is overpriced but what else can you expect with its State Street location?"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My friend invited me here, saying she had the best lamb curry here ever. I bought a red chicken curry, which was spicy and sweet. It was really good.

They have really great service. The waitress was super nice. When restaurant was closing, my friend had been taking her precious time, but they did not hurry us at all. Instead they gave us more rice and water. I will definitely go again. 

Oh and it's really cute how they make rice pyramids!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Great food but the service was horrendous. We came in on a sunday night of a holiday weekend and we were rushed by the wait staff to sit down and order about an hour before they closed (9pm).
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Went there last night and it was crowded.  Ordered food-to-go instead.  Just two items: Thai Bar-b-Que chicken and beef Pad Thai.  We were told it was going to take 10-15 minutes.  Indeed, they delivered on their promise and we were delighted.  However, the chicken, as one of the reviewers stated was dry.  The noodles had a little left to be desired in presentation; no tomatoes or parsley or peanuts as we're accustomed and expecting to see."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Everything here was absolutely amazing. A nice quiet atmosphere, good food, and attentive service!  Highly recommended"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,We were very excited to be trying this Thai restaurant that had a good number of reviews and 4 stars. So......I'm not sure what part of Thailand the owners are from but there is NO love in there food. We ordered Tom Yum and it was bland so much so that we needed to add salt.....yuck!! I've traveled all over Thailand and this restaurant has dumbed down the true essence of real Thai food. The soup was lacking Tamarind and Fish Sauce. We then ordered Panang Curry with pork. It came to us and at first I thought we ordered vegetarian Panang because except for the 6 pieces of pork the entire dish was filled with green beans. Come on.....you are using this vegetable as a filler!!! Give me pork!!!! The sauce also was lacking so much flavor. If we did not order to go I would have returned everything. Not so Thai!!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Meh. That's the best word I can use to describe this place. 

I would give the food itself 4 stars. It was actually my first brush with Thai food and I did enjoy it. My husband's food was so hot it was miserable in my opinion! He liked it, but had to eat it very slowly to even get it down, with lots of iced tea. I do understand Thai is spicy but it was specifically recommended by the server as ""Not too spicy"" so they may be a little out of touch. But my dish was rather good, I had the Chicken Noodles. The thick flat noodles seemed to be house made and they worked well all together as a dish with the chicken. 

The mark down here goes for the service which I would give 2 stars to. I felt uncomfortable and  little unwelcome here. Several times we were passed over with no word as to how things were going, this being our first time having Thai food we wanted a suggestion from the server but by the time she got over to us, I had decided on what I wanted already while my husband used the server's suggestion. I can't explain the feeling of discomfort here other than to say, it seems like they cared very little whether or not we (or their other customers) were there. We also were a little cramped with the table arrangement. 

It felt a little pricey for what we got, but in all fairness this is centrally located so that can usually bump up prices. 

My official thoughts: I can't recommend this place based on the service. Based on my limited experience with Thai I can't speak to the authenticity but as food in general it was pretty good."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"It was ok. A bit lack luster. Food was alright, nothing for me to wanting to come back."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Not spicy. Expensive and small portions. If you ask for spicy it's super toned down. Service is basic. Water. Food. Check. No extras. Nice spot on state street but we actually left to find more Thai food after going here.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Grilled eggplant salad was very good. I certainly recomend the noodle dishes. Atmosphere is good, overall a nice place."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"a little  pricier than most for thai food but they are probably passing along their cost for rent.  they have a small menu for those of you who are indecisive.  the interior is very eclectic which is a plus compared to other restaurants with the same fare.  you cannot go wrong with the curries and expect to pay a little more for anything that was pulled out of the sea, despite it being 3 blocks away"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"This is probably the worst Thai meal I've had in Santa Barbara. Stopped by with a friend to branch out for our regular Thai spots. I ordered the yellow curry with beef. If you want to mix veggies or tofo with beef is an extra $1.50. The curry had long pieces of beef with a few carrots floating around with little to no flavor. My friend ordered gluten free spicy noodles with chicken and tofu. Warning it's extremely bland. They remove all the sauces. Which is fine but definitely let the customer know beforehand. 

Thai ice tea was delicious with a good ratio of tea and condense milk."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Service was great, however place needs a GOOD clean.   Almost walked out, but based on reviews thought we would still give it a go.  Had fried tofu for the first time (not bad) and. Chicken satay to start which was good.  I got the pumpkin curry which was very nice and also the pineapple fried rice with vegetables, however the vegetables overpowered the little rice that there was so that was a little disappointing.  Waitress was very nice."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"While I can only vouch for their take out Thai Iced Teas, I can tell you they are fantastic!

Walked in here the other day & loved the atmosphere. Reminds me of all the authentic Thai places I used to frequent back home.

A very friendly woman was up at front, greeted me really kindly, and had my drink ready really fast!

I can't wait to come back and eat here, because I have heard over and over again this place is a must for Thai!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I'm a fan...and one that plans to return to this yummy place. 

Really good Thai food!! Has the reputation for being the best Thai place in SB.  Very friendly service. Very Small and intimate with lots of character in their decor style. Because it's small you need to go during an off-time because there's really no place to wait for a table. I recommend calling for a reservation even though it looks like a place that doesn't take reservations."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Good food! Pad Thai plate was really good. The Yellow Curry was a little watery for me. The waitress was very nice too.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My third Thai meal in CA and I have been consistently blown away! Thai food in London just doesn't compare. Or maybe I'm just in love with those freaky thick flat squashy noodles.... mmm... 
God they are awesome! And the sauce I had with the flat noodles was just fricking amazing, lovely and garlicky with just a hint of sweet.
And when I ordered coconut juice they brought me an ENTIRE fresh coconut, with the white fleshy bits that peeled off and made my day :D"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,I went here with a group of about 12 of us & we took up half of the place because it's really small!  The food was OK but overpriced & portions were small.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This place is OUTSTANDING.  It is a bit of a dive, but it was clean.  Whoever was in the kitchen today was FRICKIN AMAZING!   After a horrible experience at some Ventura Thai place I reluctantly tried some cocoanut milk based soup and I swear I couldn't stop eating it...  it was heaven in a bowl.  I HIGHLY recommend this place but hope it doesn't become too trendy and crowded."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Probably the worst tom kha soup I have ever had, and I eat at a thai place almost every other day! The soup was so milky, almost tasted like you are drinking whole milk, no coconut flavor, no lemongrass or ginger flavor. The spicy flat noodles was good. The portions are small for the price. Nothing out of the ordinary."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Can't help but love this place. Their duck curry is amazing and the service is always fast.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My wife and both I love Thai food and we were taken here by a friend a few years ago. This is one of the best I've ever experienced and ""checking"" it last night, it was again superb for us and our guest. The service is charming and fast, the food unbeatable. In spite of being on State Street, the restaurant is not noisy, probably because of the size of the room. A very enjoyable evening for dinner."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,My favorite Thai food restaurant! Love their dishes like the poor man noodles and chili basil chicken!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Waited 10 min and didn't get served at all. The host is just on her phone and when she finished she walked off. Hmmm...what can I say?
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The food, the service, and the ambiance were all excellent. (assuming you like a modern street ambiance) Big portions, great flavor, quick service and very friendly staff. You better make a reservation, because it gets really busy. The decoration of the place is very interesting and the waitress told me that the owner made the ornaments that are on the walls himself! Pretty impressive and beautiful. We ordered the vegetable fried rice, the chicken noodles, and two salads. The duck salad with wine dressing was absolutely delicious. The only problem was that the duck had a lot of fat. But other than that, the dinner was perfect! We loved the coconut drink. Fresh coconut water from the real coconut. It was the sweetest one we have ever tried!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Zen Yai is my favorite thai restaurant in Santa Barbara. As some others have pointed out, there are only a few other thai places here, so claiming it's the best might not be saying much. Though Santa Barbara has great restaurants in general, this isn't LA or San Francisco and so I don't know why people expect SB to be on the same level as those metropolises. 

Anyhow. Call ahead to make reservations and also to make sure they're open, as I've gone by a few times and found them closed (usually on weekend afternoons). The som tum (papaya salad) is always great, I love that dressing! Soups are yummy, curries are solid, desserts are a treat. If you love thai food, go check it out!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The Panang salmon was phenomenal.  The flavor was absolutely perfect!  The papaya salad was, for the first time with such a salad, something of which I could enjoy the complexities of the flavoring without setting my mouth ablaze in mild discomfort.  Not that I mind such things: it was just nice to feel balanced with the spice, the fresh lime juice, the peanuts, the tomatoes, etc.  The hot tea was a perfect compliment for a chilly night.

And I met my soulmate* at the next table over.  Didn't even order him: he just appeared!  Appropriately random for February 29th.  

I went to SB from LA on a whim: my friend was doing a beer promotion at a couple bars, and had a free hotel room for the night.  She invited me along, and I figured ""what the hell.""  Little did I know (that one's for you, Stranger Than Fiction fans!), I would end up being the one to find a hot guy to make out with, which is what she had wanted to do.  I figured I'd just kinda enjoy some alone time and just relax.  I must admit I enjoyed my non-alone time, and though I felt a little guilty, hey, it's not like I was looking: it just happened.  She was very gracious about it, though.  :}

So I'd spotted the other Thai place down the street when we first got to town, and that's where we headed after parking.  Even though I was looking, we blew by it.  But hey there was another one, so OK.  They had no tables for me (she was getting hers to go) so I just hung out till she got her order, and planned to proceed to the other place.  Well, I'm glad I didn't have to leave: a table opened up.  I was very happy with my meal, and was given a happy excuse to exchange looks, comments, and smiles with a lovely gentleman when I had trouble getting the attention of the lady serving me (she was a good server, just a little hard of hearing) for a hot water refill.  This gentleman happened to be dining alone also, at the table next to mine, facing me, wondering like I was, ""What is this sexy person doing here alone?""  He had been seated a good while after I had, so I was finished before he was, and offered him company.  We ended up hitting it off.  I mean, sparks flying everywhere, like damn I finally remember what this feeling is, and as much as I would have liked to feel it, and admittedly force it, for many years, it just happened right before my very eyes and heart.  Bam!

I don't know what Zen Yai puts in their food, but it tastes incredible, and seems to have some magical qualities as well!

~~~~~~
*UPDATE: definitely not my soulmate.  But a fantastic story nonetheless, so I'll keep it up.  Hope is good, right?"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Love this place. Drunken noodles are fantastic. Curries are tasty too. One of the only places that if you tell them ""make it REALLY spicy"" they will actually do it."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"highly recommend the pad thai noodles, green curry and thai iced tea..."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,I don't know where the positive reviews come from.  Our experience was horrible.  The serving sizes are very small.  Our server would place plates and food on our table as if throwing it at us.  Not only that she touched her nose while serving us.  The food was mediocre at best
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This was the place that made me start really liking food.  This was the place that also makes all other thai places stand no chance of getting 5 stars.  The owner, Wes, is a really nice guy, makes a lot of the decorations himself, has some pink floyd tattoos and likes his customers.  Yes, you, he likes you.  The rose potatoes are cooked to a perfect, buttery consistency--The curries are thick and filled with a cornucopia of delicious, seasonal, and cooked just right veggies.  The masaman curry is perfect.  I used to get teased for ordering it over and over again, but it was just that good.  I had tried every vegetarian option on the menu and most were on the excellent side, but the masaman was just exactly what I loved.  I'd say 3 out of 10 of my top meals ever were here--maybe more.  After about 4 years of living in Santa Barbara, I had easily gone here over 100 times and was not ever disappointed--even on their worst day, they were still the best thai food in town."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,This is my favorite Thai restaurant in town. They have really good lunch prices with most dishes being around $8. I love their pad Thai and panang curry. The tofu and bok choy dish is also REALLY REALLY good. I like really spicy food and they are usually really good at making it the right level of spiciness. Plus their rice comes in triangular pyramids which is a cool touch. They do have weird hours so make sure you check if they are open before you go!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Honestly the food here is so good that I would rather not leave. Ever. It's light (even the curries amazingly), the flavors are perfect every time. The spice level is great, too many places are afraid of being too spicy. There is a spicy thai basil dish that you should really try. You can get fresh young coconuts opened and you can drink them with dinner. That is one of my favorite parts about this place honestly. The ONLY problem I have had here is the size of the restaurant (but that really isn't a negative, it never gets loud)."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Zen Yai is an interesting place. The inside is a small and intimate experience. The walls are a dark maroon red with a large John Lennon painting on the wall. 

We had a reservation for 5, and they already had the table blocked off for us and gave us a choice. I decided on the table away from the table that would have lots of foot traffic.

The table we were seated at had a cool ream of paper attached to the wall with specials written on it. The menu itself was rather large. I would say a little bit larger than a ledger sized paper. Perhaps they could make them a bit smaller.

Menu wise there are a variety of choices and each section had about 6-10 dishes to choose from.

I went with the Pineapple curry.

Our wait time was reasonable 20 minutes and an older lady came out with our food. The plating was pretty good and because of the small tables it took up a bunch of space. The food was basically family style where you place everything in the middle and grab what you wanted.

Now to my dish. Well lets just say it was disappointing and lackluster. The curry was basically a soup and barely that much chicken with it. The rice was cooked pretty good. For what I got I don't think it was worth $12.

My friends shared me the fried vegetarian dish with cashews and that tasted substantially better than my dish.

Overall I was disappointed with the food, but without having tried everything else, I'll give it an average rating. 

Service was good and the atmosphere was good."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"It's all about the curry here!  Their soups aren't the best, but as far as spicy Thai deilciousness goes...possibly the BEST I've ever had!!!  I'm pretty obsessed with this place!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"When my boss offered to pick up the dinner tab for my mate and I, we called Zen Yai for reservations.  This little place has been in town for as long as I can remember and never disappoints.  

Last night we had the Tofu Sate, Red Curried veggies and Tofu and Tofu Fried rice.  We are not vegetarians or vegans but, we both enjoy the tofu especially when prepared well.  The sate is served with spicy peanut sauce and cucumber salad, great way to start a meal.  The Curry was sweet and spicy, veggies were fresh and crisp, with perfectly fried tofu.  The Pineapple fried rice is surprisingly great.   The rice was perfectly balanced with raisins, onions and cashews and it was not greasy or heavy.  
Desert:  I'm a big fan of desert.  They had a special mango and rice dish that sounded peculiar and worth a try.  The rice was a sweet brown rice cooked in a very sweet coconut milk, served warm.  The rice is plated with sliced ripe perfect mango.  Strange combo delivering delicious results, it was heavenly.

We had an appetizer, to main dishes, desert and 2 beers for about $60.

Only negatives are that the place is noisy and hard to get into without a reservation, so call ahead or it's worth the wait."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Reasonably priced, nice sized portions. We shared the tom kah & red curry with chicken. Staff was friendly & service was quick. 

But if you want to cut straight to the chase, get the sticky rice with mango slices. They shape the the rice into a cute little pyramid. The mango was fresh & the rice was the right stickiness."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Flavors are very authentic Thai and service is fast and friendly.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I came here in search of some good Pad Thai. I hail originally from Philadelphia, and we have some great Thai spots. This place has filled my void since I moved from Philly. The Pad Thai was amazing, my brother had the spicy noodle which he claimed was unreal. Service was on-point to top everything off. My good friend had his first Thai food experience here and  said the stir fry was sublime."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Of all the thai restaurants in LA, I come up to Santa Barbara whenever I can to get my Thai fix here at Zen Yai. They have the best thai dishes here and I just wish there would be a Zen Yai opening up in LA in the near future! 

Looking forward to the next time I can make it up to SB!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"The food here was good. They have three entree groups on the menu, noodle dishes, rice dishes and curries. The only seafood selection is shrimp. We had the pad thai which we enjoyed and the pumpkin curry with tofu, which could have benefited from more pumpkin. We also had the steamed veggies which were nice and crisp. Some thai beer to wash it down and it made for a nice little lunch. Overall a good thai joint for a light lunch. Order with tofu or veggies to make your entre meal vegan."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"If we could give 6 stars we would. Spicy mango salad, panang curry, coconut rice ... off the hook. Even the jasmine tea is exceptional. Can be impossible to get a table without resos if it's busy. Very small inside but the waitresses are awesome and nice. If we lived nearby we'd eat here multiple times per week."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This place is very quant and authentic Thai food! The Tom Kha was delicious!  The spicy noodles were good as well.  I actually thought my friends pumpkin curry and pineapple curry was better than my spicy noodle dish.  The wine list is small, so if you are picky about wine like myself, bring your own cine the corkage is only $10.  Make reservations if you know for sure you are going there to be sure you get a seat.  I think there are all of  8 - 12 tables in the place."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"10/10 awesome food, awesome service, very clean, very fast and great prices. I frequent this place for lunch and occasionally go for dinner. Not a week has passed that I have missed zen yai at least once for lunch. No complaints at all. You will not be disappointed.... unless you get the table in the back with the bench, the bench is uncomfortable, but who cares... everything else is awesome!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I had the much acclaimed pumpkin curry with chicken, a spicy green curry with big chunks of red peppers, potatoes, pumpkin, and basil. It was delicious. I also got to try a little of each of my friend's dishes: Vegetable Pad Thai, Poorman's Noodles, and Tofu Red Curry. All were delicious. I'm from Philadelphia where we have our choice of several amazing Thai restaurants. Zen Yai easily compares to the best in Philly."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,What a wonderful place to eat!  I think what makes eating here a great experience is mostly how friendly and sweet the staff is! The food is AMAZING. I come from LA and eat Thai food here in LA all the time. The food from here is just as amazing and I appreciate the customer service frrom the staff as well. Next time we are in the area we will be eating here again!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I live in SB and have been searching for an amazing Thai restaurant since moving here from the East Coast where you get really good Asian food.  I have been to Your Place on Milpas, Galanga on State, and now Zen Yai. I was hoping this would be ""the"" Thai restaurant, but It didn't wow me.
The food was tasty and the service efficient; in my opinion the place is a little claustrophobic - really small and tables really close together.  Some might find that intimate and romantic, so it's a preference thing. Décor seems to be very eclectic and hodgepodge in most Thai restaurants wherever you go, so I don't expect a lot in terms of aesthetics - just looking for that great food. I ordered a scallop special which was delicious but I had to order rice a la carte - I asked twice to make sure.  Never have I been in any Asian restaurant where a non-noodle dish did not come with white rice.
We also ordered a Red Panang curry chicken which was also tasty, but it had more green beans in it than chicken. I will go back and try some of their other dishes, but as of right now, all the above restaurants I mention are about equal in terms of taste and service."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is the best Thai in town. We love it.  Food is always fresh, hot and delicious.  I'm not a huge fan of the soups, but everything else is quite good.  
In regards to the lighting (as the previous reviewer discussed) -- this place is a dimly lit whole-in-the-wall and that's what makes it awesome. It's on lower state, along with a bunch of clubs, the adult store, the 99 cent store. Makes me feel like I'm in Thailand (sort of :-)).  
Here's why it's better than MANY other restaurants in town - food is consistently good.  You always get your food in a timely manner.  They actually answer their phone and can write down your order QUICKLY when you call for take-out (which is more than I can say for almost every other restaurant in SB).  Bottom line -- in our small little beach town, good Asian food is hard to find. Look no further..."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We really enjoyed our meal here. The staff was super efficient. The Pad See Ewe, Pumpkin Curry & Panang Curry were really tasty. Not very impressed with the Spicy Fried Rice. It was spicy, but lacked other flavor. We visited the business in the afternoon, so it didn't feel dark or dimly lit to us. I would recommend stopping by if you are in the mood for Thai flavors."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I've been here on several occasions, and have also traveled throughout Thailand, which is why of course I only eat Thai food at Zen Yai. I've been to other restaurants in the area and have been disappointed; don't expect this to be an 100% authentic Thai experience, but this is as good as it gets around here!

The food is overall very good, only on a few instances have the dishes been bland (drunken noodles, and their scallops)

Their curries are just right, and so is their beef salad--be specific as far as how spicy you want them though. It's hit/ miss sometimes

they have Singha & Chang beers...only missing Tiger, of course!

Definitely a great atmosphere, it does get VERY crowded especially around dinner, so make sure you have reservations in advance if you're planning on coming with a group"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is my favorite Thai place yet! It is pretty small but I've never had to wait more than 25 min for a table. The decorations are really cute and the staff is friendly. They do amazing curries! I've had the yellow, red, and pumpkin curries so far and they are to die for. They also offer brown rice instead of white which is a big plus for me. Their pad thai is also amazing and comes in a good portion. Zen Yai is top notch! If you love thai food and are in the area you have to stop by."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Such a great find in Santa Barbara! Its a tiny little place at the end of state street that gets busy at night so you might want to make a reservation if your party size is larger than two people...the staff is great and the portions are great for what you spend... We go there almost every week!! Have yet to find a better Thai place anywhere else in California!!!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Went here because it got the hightest rated tai food in Santa Barbra. However I think this place only deserves 2 stars instead of 4. I ordered the curry and I'm pretty sure they forgot to add in the coconut milk because mine tasted very watered down. My boyfriend ordered the chicken/shrimp pad tai and he ended up getting food poisoning from it! After taking only a few bites of my food I was very over it. Santa Barbra really needs a better tai food selection. I will not be returning.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Group of 5 dined here for dinner, and all 5 dishes were fantastic!  We ate:
-Pumpkin Curry - a tiny bit sweet and a nice spice to it.  Really great dish with chunks of pumpkin in it.
-Pad Thai with chicken, tofu and shrimp: great flavors, also a bit sweet, but overall great flavors and huge portion
-Panang Curry: Standard dish but very flavorful and fresh
-Poor Man's Noodles: Excellent, flavorful noodle dish
-Garlic Scallops: Huge portion (4 large scallops) with spinach and zuchinni.  Flavorful and very filling, and a very reasonable price.

Overall, great experience and great meal - we'll definitely be back!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Best thai food in Santa Barbara (I've been to every one of them). The poorman noodles with pork are unique and amazing. Love the curry and vegetable fried rice as well. Good quality meat, which I've found can be a bit sketchy at some places. It's small, so your best bet is to make a reservation."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Like most of my favorite places, a little pricey and not as good as it once was.  And they kinda screwed me on a Valentine's Day reservation a few years ago.

Paramrongsong is excellent.  Pad thai used to be good, but last few times was over-cooked and not very exciting.  Golden basket appetizer is a good choice if it's in your budget."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"This place gets super crowded on the weekends. It took a while for our group of three to get attended too and seated, which the server apologized for a few times. There's a nice ambient feel to the place; kind of like your quaint distant aunt's living room.

I ordered the Pad Thai which was good but a little skimpy on shrimp. I would've also preferred to have a slight kick to it. My friend ordered the massaman curry which she really enjoyed. They were attentive with water refills.

I think I would rather try another state street location next time I'm in the area since there's a variety of options."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We ordered the Tom Kha soup, Pad Thai noodles, and the pork stir fry. The portions were not as big as what I'm use to, but the flavors were the best I've had in a while. I've read reviews on how their food lacks presentation.... Does that really matter when the flavor of the food just blows you away? I think not. Will go back next time in Santa Barbara"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"No appetizers on the lunch menu so could only order curry, noodles or fried rice. Also no bottled water, only iced tea, soda or Thai drinks. Food was a bit bland. Positives for vegetarian dishes had the best mix of vegetables for a vegetarian curry. No parking on street in front. Overall would not come back here again"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,I have been coming here for years and always have a great meal. The food is consistent fresh and always made house you ordered it. Very attentive and friendly staff. Great thai food on lower state street. Sometimes there is a little wait but it is well worth it. Try some of their specials. Great thai iced tea and thai iced coffee.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The duck curry is one of the best I've tried. We love their spring rolls - light, fluffy, delicious, and the dipping sauce is excellent. I've had the Pad Thai, and it's good, but not as good as that duck curry. The pumpkin curry is also amazing. I am a huge fan of their Panang dishes - they have the right blend of hot-smokey-sweet. Staff is always attentive and kind."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"It was supposed to be my Birthday dinner, but, instead, we were met with rudeness. We were seated and then moments later told that they had a reservation for a party of 7 at the table they just sat us at (the restaurant was filled with customers who have been there already). We were told that we need to eat within an hour so they can seat the other people.  How rude! To give your customers a time limit to eat so they can fill it with more.  Needless to say we left & ate at a more bigger & more pleasant restaurant just 1 block down, also Thai, called Galanga.  This place was excellent, friendly, and attentive.  Zen Yai deserves a 0 rating, but , since I cannot post without giving something, they get an undeserved rating of 1."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Best Thai we have ate outside of Thailand - We had the Tom Kah soup, Poorman noodles (not exactly Thai) and the calamari special. 

We are only in town for a few days, but we will be back."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Great little place! The Veggie noodle soup is yummy just ask for a little extra broth, I think the noodles soak a little bit up. The Shu-Mai appetizer is really flavorful, the chicken is tender and juicy, Its wrapped in I don't know what, but its good. The egg rolls are alright, its three egg rolls cut on the diagonal, served with a sweet semi sour sauce. Loved the Vibe and it was quick and easy. Also they have amazing service, both the busser and server. we will be back!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Had panang curry, pad thai, pineapple fried rice, tom yum soup, pad see eww.   Food was pretty good but not amazing.  Service was OK.  They were sort of rushing us."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Food is good but overpriced. As Thai goes, nothing exceptional. Interesting decor."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My favorite restaurant on State Street in Santa Barbara. Incredible Thai food, high quality wine and beer, wonderful service and a great atmosphere. Food is healthy and very flavorful. Zen Yai is small and wonderfully local. Enjoy!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,This place is my new pick in Santa Barbara!! The Tom yum soup and duck curry tasted super good! The service was perfect and we got dessert For FREE! Can't be better!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Wonderful little Thai restaurant with a very warm and friendlty environment. The curry is fantastic. The portions are fair for the pricing and the service is on point! 

I love going here with a small group."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Best Thai in town! I love their drunken noodles...I order it every time and it's very consistent and it never disappoints me.

Their soups are also good and I recommend their clear soup over the coconut one. 

Service is also good and excellent atmosphere
."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Had yellow curry with coconut milk and white rice. Blah. Wife had Red curry and white rice with tofu in place of eggplant. Blah. Neither of us enjoyed out meal. There may have been 4 peas in the curry, if that. We overheard some other customers stating that he only found 4 cubes if tofu in his curry."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The downtown Santa Barbara strip isn't exactly the place to go to for authentic culinary experiences. There are clubs, followed by a mall, followed by chain restaurants and then the usual suspects of H&M, Abercrombie, Lucky Brand, American Apparel, and all the other brands that make up the homogenized patchwork that is the American consumer experience.

Hidden away near the end of the strip is Zen Yai. It's great and nothing like the other places crowding it out. We had no problems with the service and in fact enjoyed it quite a bit. There were five of us and it went smoothly. 

The pumpkin shrimp curry was fantastic, the fried tofu was different and tasty, and the noodle dishes we had were pitch perfect. I'd easily come here again."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Fairly average restaurant with a low cut of meat, very dry meat. 

Unfortunately, Santa Barbara is not known for its thai food, it's all rather mediocre. If you're from out of town go to L.A. and try Chan Dara on Pico or on Cahuenga -- THAT is savory thai food. 

p.s. And if a customer asks nicely if you can turn down the house music you're blaring, you may want to just turn it off rather than ""compromise"" and turn it down like a half a notch. Not cool, we're not here to serve your agenda to get your house on. We're here to eat a meal in peace and quiet."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Duck Salad... Duuuuuck Salaaaaaaaad! It's SO good! May be the most perfect dish ever!

This place is expensive, for the portion size. However, the quality of the food makes up for that. The presentation is lovely and the service is great.   It's a very small place, but I've never had to wait long, even on busy nights, with or without a reservation.

When i want to indulge a little, this is where I come. 

Be warned, they do keep odd hours, so be sure to call first. They close between lunch and dinner and some days, they are not open for lunch or dinner or both, at all. They have posted hours by the door, but I have come by during those hours and they have been closed early. Definitely call first, to make sure, especially if it is towards the end of their posted hours!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Cute little place in Santa Barbara -- one of those places that are decorated with art, dimly lit and cozy.  Service items, table lights, restaurant décor all very unique and old (Thia) school.  The food is served with style too -- pretty little painted china tea pot for the tea -- sake in artsy little containers -- rice in a pyramid. My companion had the Massaman curry with chicken and it was good and tasty but absolutely no heat (spice) whatsoever.  The dish was served with a brown sauce and a bit on the sweet side.  I had the chicken satay and this was very good too.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Sake nice and HOT (just the way I like it).  Definitely worth a try"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Very nice quaint restaurant in downtown Santa Barbara. The service was nice and the prices are reasonable. I had Pad Thai and Stir Fry which was delicious. Will definitely eat here again.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Food is decent but not the thai i am used to,being from LA area. Service was average as the server was more interested in my entre order when i just wanted to take it easy and start with soup. She must have asked for my order 4-5 times. I wont come back for average experience. 3 stars for the food -1 for the service."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Again booked this place based on research on Yelp and this food was phenomenal. We had a great waitress and some of the best thai i've ever had. There were about 8 of us and though the place is small, they let us reserve ahead of time. It was packed but with good reason. Great food, nice atmosphere creepy, white dude that must have the host or lurker, not sure which one. He's the only edit I would make to the overall atmosphere. He kept circling our table here and there and not really doing anything - but I will still give it 5 stars because the food was fantastic! Oh, yeah and all of ordered appetizers, entrees, drinks and it wasn't very expensive at all!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Not the greatest Thai we've had, but not bad. We started with the the fried egg rolls and plum sauce, then shared a house salad with ginger sauce. Both were tasty and decent portions. For our main course we tried panang veggies and massaman tofu. The rice was a tad underdone, but the panang curry had a nice kick to it. The massaman curry was decent, and the tofu was cooked well. Total bill was just over $40."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The best place for Thai food in SB! My friend and I tried coming here 3 times but it was always closed/closing. But the 4th times a charm! It's a small space but an eccentric, colorful atmosphere. We got the panang curry, papaya salad, spicy thai noodles, and thai tea. The curry and spicy thai noodles were so delicious! It was the perfect spiciness level. The rice comes in a pyramid shape.. so cute! The papaya salad was pretty good but I've had better. You can definitely judge a good Thai restaurant by their Thai Tea and this one is delicious! It's my new place when I'm craving for Thai. I'll come back to try the duck curry and spicy basil calamari."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Delicious food!! The panang curry was some of the best I've had! Very friendly staff, highly recommend!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is the second time we have been to this restaurant. Had Spicy Fried Rice, was really good. Also ordered Chili Basil with brown rice, tasted good. Learnt one thing from the server, even if we are ordering from the vegetarian menu, we have to explicitly mention, no fish sauce, otherwise the dish comes with fish sauce itseems."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"As i was departing from SF, i started to crave for Thai food. I didn't know where to locate one, so i decided to go on my phone and search on yelp for a good place. I came across this place, since i was near here on my way back home to the OC.  i read the reviews, everything people were saying  bout this place was accurate..food was pricey( thai tea drink was good), place was small, server was nice, and the host was new i think because she did act how a new worker would act in a restaurant. 

Chicken Pad Thai- the chicken had no flavoring, there was no peanuts on the dish, which i would of liked. they added to much lemon over the dish, it tasted to sour.

Beef GArlic Pepper- it was ok, can't really explain it more than it was ok.
 
Pork Larb- It was good but could of been better."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Excellent. Best I've had outside of Thailand. Mango sticky rice rocked my world, as did the pumpkin curry."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Quaint little place. Service is quick, got food within 10 minutes of order. Ordered the duck rolls and a beer, spicy beef just spicy enough to have another beer....Fantastic!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Went on a first dinner date here and it was mildly exotic and romantic. The service was wonderful, and so was the curry. 

But the coconut milk soup was so so to me, maybe I should ask for more heat next time."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Just your average Thai food place, Tom kha and red curry were just avg, spicy fried rice was good"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We ordered the mango tofu salad, calamari stir fry, and spicy noodles. There were far more dishes on the menu that  I wanted to try including duck stir fry, pumpkin curry, and well, all the desserts.  

There was miscommunication amoung the wait staff that got a bit awkward so they lose a star for that."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We love this place! The pad thai is so good with lots of meat and veggie. Also, the tom yom seafood plat is yummy and with lot lots lots of seafood in there.
Fried tofu as appetizer is also good.
And their table set is pretty lovely if you check out my picture for that. They have the table cloth put as the breast cancer sign not sure intentionally or not.
So, we were happy about everything that we ordered. :D"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I brought my family of 5  here last night and dropped a lot of money. Two of my adult kids had the  yellow curry which is usually a hit. (Props to Lotus Thai San Diego and Thai Orchard Murrieta setting the bar). 

1. Yellow curry...  bland and watery. (My adult daughters had a very disappointed look on their faces after taking their first bite. I found myself giving up my Pad Thai).  Veggies were under cooked and I did add a lot of chilli paste and other flavors to get myself to eat it.

2. Duck curry.....  coming from a picky all American 16 yr old  boy 5/10. I'd take it as pretty good coming from an adult. 

3. Seafood Curry... wife describes it as frozen seafood substandard from costco with cheap sauce poured over it. Flavor bland. Very disappointed.

4. Pad Thai.....  Mine. It was average...let me be honest.... my 21 yr old college daughter traded with me due to the yellow curry she didn't like. But yes my opinion 5/10. 

5. Waitress.... she was friendly and entertaining and tried very hard. 

Summery.... would not recommend.  Food wasn't worth the  $100 bill. Very disappointing  :("
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Very disappointed!  I went for dinner on Friday night 9/7/12 with my teen son & adult daughter. We love Thai food & the reviews on Yelp gave us the encouragement to try it.  We were disappointed, and frankly I am surprised that people in the SB area are so easily pleased by mediocre food.   We ordered some brown rice that was fine.  We ordered green curry with tofu & I didn't think it was possible to ruin tofu, but they did. It was too chewy, like a rubberband (reminded me of snails) & the middle felt empty.  I think it was really old.   Like it was stir fried a couple days before.  It seemed the tofu was dehydrated.   The curry sauce was good,but the serving of green curry was pretty small.   We ordered stir fried vegetables to be healthy & the serving was really tiny.  A few vegetables with chicken and a couple noodles thrown in.   Not enough for even one person.  Lastly we ordered fried rice with chicken that was ok, but as in the stir fried veges. with chicken, the chicken was hard to find.   We also ordered an appetizer (so we would have enough food for 3 people LOL), and it was the cream cheese puffs but they add some scallop pieces in it which isn't need & then people like my son who don't really like all seafood won't try it.   The restaurant is located in an area that isn't great and at night the homeless are all over the sidewalks.   The shop next door had Xrated stuff in the window, so it was embarrassing to be walking past with my teen son and my daughter.   Across the street was a crappy 99cent store.   The restaurant is very tiny with not enough tables to really make a profit, so maybe that is why the portions are half size.   There is no outdoor dining either.  Seats maybe 25 people roughly.   For ambiance there was an actual traffic light in the restaurant with all red lenses which lent a nice red glow to the room, but the traffic light was out of place in a Thai eatery.   I didn't check out the restrooms. 

I would not recommend that anyone eat there."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"July 2018 update:
Soon after we last dined there (see January review), a renovation took place.  We were eager to return anticipating the same consistent excellent food, service and ambience like we had many times over the past years.  The restaurant was full with the exception of couple of empty tables.  While seated and waited for 20 minutes, we noticed that most of the other tables there before us were still waiting for their water. We noticed a change of staff and manager.  We wonder if the owner sold the restaurant to someone else, and changed the cooks as well??  Because they were definitely not keeping up with any of the customers just sitting and waiting.  Two tables finally got there food and we wondered how long they waited.  We decided we didn't want to spend the next 2 or 3 hours to find out how it'll all pan out.  Now, I'm waiting for some updated reviews before having the confidence to try them again.  Bummed.  I miss the old Zen Yai.


Jan 2018
This is now one of our favorite restaurants for Asian dining.  It's quaint with a splash of a quirky artistry.  We've been here many times before, and it was good enough then but lately, seems they've changed their chef/cook because though the names of the dishes remain the same on the menu, the dishes taste a lot better, much more flavorful and seasoning well balanced, not too salty.  The presentation is better too.  Service is still friendly and efficient.  We are definitely a fan."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,This is a cute little place. The pad thai was delicious! The server and host were very friendly and attentive. It's small so I imagine it gets pretty busy at certain times. I was visiting Santa Barbara and unsure about the restaurants in the area but I'm glad I stopped in for dinner!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Food was pretty good, and it was served quickly. We also liked the pyramid shape of the rice.

I am knocking down a star because they were not accommodating for our large party. We ended up having to arrange ourselves during our meal."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This restaurant is a treasure! The service was prompt, the staff were helpful and attentive, and the food was delicious and filling. A big shoutout to the owner, David, for being hospitable and friendly. Such a nice guy!!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I have now had food from here delivered via Door Dash twice, and both times the order was correct. Most importantly, the food was fresh, hot, fragrant, and so delicious. Several coworkers and I LOVE this place. We will definitely order again, and I look forward to my first in-house visit very soon to try more of their awesome food."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The smoked tofu mango salad is insane. everything else is very good, but the salad was excellent. Great dressing and a nice combination of textures and flavors."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I just took my parents to Zen Yai for dinner tonight for the first time. I have to say it was pretty good! The dining area is extremely small (only about 10 - 12 small tables) and the decor is pretty terrible. However, the waitresses are nice and the food is pretty good. I definitely recommend the duck curry (the one with pumpkin in it). It's different and the pumpkin (which I was a little apprehensive about) was delicious. I highly recommend their special, the Spicy Basil Calamari. It's not fried calamari like at Italian restaurants. It's stir-fried. Aka, stir-delicious! It's not too spicy but has just enough kick to make you notice it. We also ordered the Duck Roll as an appetizer. Don't order it. It came with mustard and a plum dipping sauce. The mustard wasn't even asian mustard. It tasted just like French's original yellow mustard. Gross on duck. We also ordered the Smoked Tofu and Mango Salad which I had heard, from previous reviews, that it was good. It was pretty good. I would recommend it. The smoked tofu was definitely different than what I was used to but I'd order it again. I didn't get a chance to order dessert but maybe next time. I wouldn't come here constantly but I'd definitely try it again. The Pad Woon Sen looked promising."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Yum! The pumpkin curry with shrimp is amazing, but the service is just so so.  The location is nice, nice ambiance, always enjoyed the food."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Amazing Duck Curry!!! Very few tables, but somehow got lucky to be seated immediately. So glad! Would have waited for such great Thai :)"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I love this place.  It's kinda funky, but in a good way - it has character.  The food is incredible, and the staff is excellent.  

I recommend the yellow curry with brown rice, or the pad thai.  If you like things spicy, they aren't afraid to crank it up for you!    Both are fantastic."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I love this place. Zen Yai has such delicious food it's incredible. I am vegan and I was so happy to see that Zen Yai was vegan friendly. I've been twice in the past week and I've gotten the pad thai with tofu and the spicy noodles with tofu. Both dishes were incredible, I can't pick a favorite! Zen Yai has excellent service as well, very friendly workers who are always checking up on you. They boxed my food for me and I was so pleased with that. This is such a great small restaurant - it is important to support small local restaurants such as these. I 100% recommend Zen Yai for vegans and non vegans alike!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"New owners with new decor - don't care for the decor at all. The new menu is different as well. 
Have talked to a few people that walked out after walking in the restaurant and seeing the change to the interior.  Blue walls with string lights all over just doesn't do it!  Very cold and not inviting. 
Hope the new owners read this and consider changing the ambiance. 
Miss the Thai lettuce wraps."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I have to admit I am biased. I have been coming here for something crazy like 9 years or so. I have come to know the family very well, and they are so very sweet and loving. When I get a chance, I try to come in and visit and dine here every opportunity I can. This is our favorite Thai restaurant, anywhere. 

Such fresh ingredients, made with love, and authentic (at least that is what my wife tells me, as I have not been to Thailand). The decor is wonderful, the place is cozy, and the food so tasty. Definitely make a reservation if you want to eat here, as it is very small. Intimate, if not private. 

If you want to get away from the norm, try Zen Yai. You will not be disappointed. My bet is you come back for more. 

As many have commented, the pineapple curry, the pumpkin curry and the duck curry are amazing. I love the larb, and the naked shrimp salad. Their desserts are to die for. Go out on a limb. You will not be disappointed. 

I am going to SB, now, as I am dying for some Zen Yai love."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is a nice, cozy place with good food. I ordered the pad thai and thought it was good. My husband got the pumpkin curry and loved it. The staff were welcoming and friendly."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Very tasty I really enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend to anyone. Great atmosphere overall with excellent lighting (we came for a late dinner) and was still seated. The display of food is well done, similar to a 5 star restaurant."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Good, solid Thai food on touristy State Street.

The restaurant is a bit small, so it can feel cramped when its full.

The interior is funky, to be charitable. Thai-style furniture, mobiles made from different colored lenses, a large painting of John Lennon hanging in the back wall...eclectic kitsch would be one way of describing it. The owner is definitely trying hard to create a mood, what with the smooth electronica music playing in the background and the reddish lighting - for a moment, I felt I was back in a certain area in Amsterdam...

Thank goodness the food is much, much better than the interior!

Pad Thai- Competent rendition of a Thai restaurant menu stalwart.
Duck Curry- Sweetness of pumpkin worked well with the curry and Chinese-style barbecued duck.
Papaya Salad- Good, crunchy shredded green papaya with sweet tart fish-sauced based dressing.
Shiu Mai - Shiu mai in a Thai restaurant? WTF? We sampled the pork/shrimp version anyway. It was surprisingly good!
Tom Yum Gai - Good, spicy. Would be perfect on a cold night.

Pricing is what is to be expected of SB. Not exactly cheap. Courses can quickly go up to $12 for entrees."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Pad se ewe was ok. Tom kah was bland AF- do not recommend. Delivery was on time via Yelp (Grubhub)
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"This place serves pretty good food, however I was disappointed by the service last time I went. The waitress told us that we had to leave about 10 min after we were done with dinner, because they have a small place and needed the space. I did not really like that, as when I go out, I don't only go out to eat!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Always welcomed very nicely and served with the best
 Thai food! It is a nice environment that I enjoy eating good food with friends"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Best food ever! I am a picky eater and a vegetarian and it is SO hard to find good vegetarian Thai food even in big cities like la and nyc. The vegetarian pad  was flavorful and had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The service and presentation was amazing and it's some of the best Thai food I've ever had!!!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,favorite thai food place in Santa Barbara!!! I have never had a bad experience here and i have been here many times. My favorite dish is the pineapple chicken curry. Also their pad Thai is AMAZING!!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Ate here for the first time and food was great!!  Had the duck curry and the silver noodle w/shrimp entree... soooo delicious!!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The curries are delicious, affordable, and authentic!  Place is decorated a little funky, but charming, and I'm here for the food anyway, so no matter."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Good local Thai food.  Tried the pad se ewe and coconut soup.  The noodles were decent, but I was looking for that wok fired taste.  Coconut soup with chicken was a little thicker than most tom ka gai soups I've had in the past...was more like a coconut chicken stew than a soup, but it had decent flavor and there was a good amount of chicken.  There were also lots of in-edibles I had to constantly pick out of most spoonfuls.  Galangal, lime leaves, ginger and lemongrass. Sure, they are essential, but not things I like to actually eat.  Good service and good value."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is a such great Thai restaurant, great service, good foods, good atmosphere, reasonable prices. Love here for every single things. Will be back. Thank you David and the servers."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Consistently the best Thai restaurant in Santa Barbara! Spicy noodles with tofu is amazing. Their yellow curry always has the best coconut milk taste compared to other Thai restraints that I have been to. The decor is kitchy/cool and momma Yai is always so sweet and friendly.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Very standard Thai place, and it was recommended to me by a good friend who said this was the place to go, so I stopped in for lunch.

The whole place was to myself, which I personally love, and then ordered quick, simple, and fast Pad Thai with Chicken.  Usually my go to.

The waitress was very sweet, we talked about plenty of things since the restaurant was so dead. She also said I was the first customer of the day at 1:30pm and they were open since 11:30, so that is definitely a slow day.

The food came out quickly and promptly, the portion size was great too.  Food was a little bland, but you get a spice rack to spice it up, and theres plenty of choices for that.

Great spot for a quick lunch. Nothing fancy, just a standard Thai place great for meetings or on the go. 4 stars!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Love this place. For me, this is my comfort food - specifically the Tom Kah. Always receive great friendly service. Quality is superb - all the best cuts, no mystery meat!

Last night I had the Tom Kah with Chicken which is always delicious, the Nam Sod which was amazing, and the Chili Basil with beef which I thought was mild (I took it to go so did not have extra chili paste to spice it up). The Chili Basil needs to be eaten with as many ingredients in the same mouthful as possible because the flavors are absorbed differently in the different items. So if you just eat a piece of the beef, you are missing out on the total flavor of the dish.

Totally recommend."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Delicious chili basil vegetables and khao soi, which they made vegetarian. Great attentive service too!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Oh my goodness I loved the food here!  I'm a bit perplexed at some of the comments regarding portion size & prices.  I've only been to a handful of Thai Restaurants but I think the portion sized were a little larger than the other and the prices were comparable.  Most places in SB are overpriced.  Location, location peeps!  When I first walked in I had mixed feelings...  Either this is a great hole in wall discovery or it's going to be really bad.  Well, I was so excited to find out that it was a great discovery!!  Althought the atmosphere, furnishings, etc. are less than desirable (in general) the food was great and our waiter was wonderful.  He thanked us & told us he appreciated our comments when we told him how good it was.  He was genuine, friendly, efficient & accurate with our order.  We ordered the yellow curry and the PaLuck and both were SO good.  I like my food spicy but I don't want to be blowing my nose ever 5 seconds either and they got it spot on.  Great flavors!  I really cannot say enough about how good the food is :-) .  I even brought it home & ate it for breakfast the next day.  Oh what a treat!  I will be a repeat customer for sure & recommend this little hole in the wall to the Thai food fan! YUMMY!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Came in here right after work on Cinco de Mayo to get some scrumptious Thai food in my stomach.. I heard previously from my co-workers that this place had good food so I decided to cross the street and try it out! 

Definitely a good choice! I ordered Thai Iced Tea (ALWAYS A MUST!) and the spicy chicken fried rice with chicken pad thai.  The portions were pretty big.. as the two portions STUFFED my friend and I afterwards.  The service I got here was not phenomenal, but it definitely was not bad! The hostess at the front was super sweet and smiled and did not mind at all when I kept asking her questions & for excess condiments. 

The only thing I did not like was how quiet it was in there! I had just got out of a busy shift at work after Cinco de Mayo and was ready to just talk a lot with my friend but I felt confined to whispering and keeping my voice down since the vibe in the restaurant was more mellow, quiet, and relaxing.  Definitely good for a date, just not for two girls trying to catch up. :P Overall, delicious food, good service, mediocre prices, and the food came out quickly as well! MMMM I can't wait to come back here to try some more of their dishes!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Such great Thai food! The dumplings are fantastic! And so were the poor mans noodles and yellow curry! Fantastic service! We will definitely be back next time we are in Santa Barbara!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I had the Pad Thai, Pineapple curry, Tom yum! It was all amazing and the service was excellent! I will definitely be back soon!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Fair pricing and their pad thai tasted very good.
When I called and asked about gluten free options, they were very helpful and answered all my questions."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I love Thai food and most places I've been to were good.
This place, unfortunately, doesn't deserve more than 2 stars.
The only good thing about it is its location.
Me and my mom were visiting Santa Barbara and decided to have lunch on State street, and here it was - Thai food with great reviews (4 starts)- obviously, we bought it.
I ordered my favorite noodle dish- Pad See Ew. My mom asked for shrimps with mixed veggies and white rice on the side.
The service was pretty slow, I think we waited for at least 20 minutes. 
My dish looked fine... but I've never had such a bad Pad See Ew before. The worst thing about it was broccoli. They were very undercooked (almost raw) and very bitter. Another thing, the sauce wasn't sweet enough for this dish. I've had Pad See Ew many times in different places. This place served me the worst version of it.
My mom's plate was quite large, but the funny thing is it was mainly the veggies. There were literally 6 medium sized shrimps. And when the bill came with 12 $ for this portion, I was furious. The waitress actually never told me the price of it beforehand, so I assumed that it wouldn't be more expensive than other dishes on the menu (8-9$). 
I will never come back to this place!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"A group of 8 of us went here on a Saturday night. We did have to wait a bit for a reservation, but it was worth the wait. Food was good, service was really nice."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Really wanted to like Zen Yai as much as my fellow Yelpers. At the risk of sounding like an insufferable snob, I will tell you straightaway that I know a lot about Thai food. I have studied at a Thai cooking school over the past ten years, and I have spent three weeks in the country. Please stop here if you don't find me credible. (Which I suppose makes me INcredible! :)

More Asian Fusion than Thai. Duck in a flour burrito, and shrimp with snap peas and Japanese mushroom--that should give you the idea.  I did not come seeking authenticity, but rather good preparation and bright flavors. Snap peas were overcooked. Spicy fried rice was not spicy.

On the plus side, service was attentive, friendly, and the food came out in about five minutes flat. 

Overall, pretty pedestrian fare in a pleasant, trendy setting with a great waitstaff and a huge portrait of John Lennon.  If you want better, with a more authentic (though still somewhat Americanized) flair, drive up State into the 'burbs, and try Your Choice for dinner, or Thai on a Truck for lunch."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My first time here with 9 friends to celebrate a birthday. Lee was amazing, and so was the food! Everything was delicious, from the pad Thai noodles, to the soups (coconut and duck), to the poor man's noodles. I really enjoyed the food here and look forward to another trip here."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is a cute little restaurant in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara.  There is limited seating and it's always crowded in there but I've never had to wait too long for a table.  The wait  is longer on a Saturday evening after 7 p.m. (up to 1/2 hr).  The hostess and servers are accommodating.  Most of the time, I order take out so that alleviates any issues with having to park and walk around to State St. and wait to be seated.  I do a ""drive by"": I pull up to the sidecurb right in front of the restaurant, the passenger jumps out of the car and goes in to pick up the food, I drive around the block one time and back to the front of the resto to pick up the passenger and goods.  Score!!

The panang and red curry dishes (I like the brown rice option better) are delicious and so are the noodle dishes.  You can specify how spicy you want your dishes to be.. be careful of the green chilis if you request spicy.  They are scorching hot!!  The other night, I ordered the ""pumpkin curry with chicken"" dish and must say that it was one of the best curry (and interesting) dishes I've ever had. YUM!  I also always end up ordering the spicy mint noodles (it's tasty with beef).  The two dishes added up to be around $23 (take out, does not incl. tips).  Yes, Zen Yai may seem pricey but actually, the cost of a dinner for 2 is pretty comparable to other restaurants in downtown SB."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"we ordered: tom yum soup, red curry, and basil eggplant, total: $42.  

overall experience, mediocre.  

the place is for students or tourists, I definitely wouldn't have eaten here if I didn't happen to be staying by east beach when my folks were visiting. 

but the place does have good ambiance, it's small, dark and you can hold a good conversation if you're on a date.  good date spot, bad spot for decent thai food."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Recently went back to this place and discovered it is under new ownership. We really liked it before, but this last visit was disappointing.

First, we ordered an appetizer right when we sat down because we were hungry. But after all are dishes came out already, this never came.

We also ordered what we always order at Thai restaurants as a benchmark : Pad Thai and Pad See Eew. I recalled the pad see eew having a tasty wet sauce, but ours was dry and barely had any sauce on it. Pad Thai was ok but it didn't have any shrimp in it despite it being listed on the menu. Flavor was ok.

They had new decor that felt modern and clean aesthetic."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Either we were starving or this place has AMAZING food!! Had the shrimp salad to start, shrimp with chili basil and pad Thai...also with shrimp. Guess we like our shrimp! Lol! Fantastic and it hit the spot! The spice level was right on! Will definitely go back when in SB."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"We found the food here to be a mixed bag. I got the ginger shrimp and loved it; very flavorful and unique. My boyfriend got the red curry and said he wasn't at all impressed, that it was somewhat bland. 
As for the service, the servers were intensely attentive. We were checked on every few minutes... A bit too often to have a peaceful meal. 
The location was great, very central.
If you do find yourself here, order the ginger shrimp :)"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Delicious surprise!  A local favorite among many tourist joints.  Atmosphere is trendy but not too much so.  Get the table in the window and people watch state street while you enjoy nice fusion style Thai food.  Spicy Thai noodles and Poorman noodles are excellent.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I was craving Thai food, so my family and I decided to check out Zen Yai after reading reviews on Yelp. We visited the restaurant on a Friday night, around 7, and it was completely empty (in fact, we even thought it was closed!) The service was great, though and we were promptly seated. We tried the chicken saté, the fried tofu, yellow curry, and pineapple fried rice. The food was fresh and loaded with veggies, but it was nothing special. It might be the best Thai food in Santa Barbara, but that's not saying a lot. Maybe we should've taken the emptiness as a hint and tried another place."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Love this place!  Been coming here for years, and the Poor Man's Noodles and Tom Kha Gai (coconut chicken soup) are still the bomb!  Interior and management has changed over the years, but still our go-to spot on State Street..."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"I have mixed reviews about this restaurant.

The size of the restaurant is very small.  Very little elbow space.  The service was good but some of them were conversing with others rather than focusing on customers.

Food wise, this is where it gets hard because the food is simply 'fine', unfortunately I've had better.  I shouldn't compare this restaurant with others, but the only conclusion I could come up with is 'this is the only Thai restaurant in Santa Barbara'.  Actually, there is one other, but this happened to be on State St so it was convenient."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Excellent food and service!  Friendly staff. Vegetarian friendly too.   We really enjoyed our dinner.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"So my family and I dropped by here yday after a long day of sightseeing..... we were hungry and we have lots of experience with Thao food as well..... it is my favorite after homecooked meals..... they were a little busy and it seems like the owner was exhausted from throughout the day. We order Spicy chili basil ground chicken which is my favorite! It was cooked nicely but not too spicy....... We also ordered the chicken satay which was average.  The pad kee mow was great! Veggies were fresh and crisp and cooked well.... Next time we visit, it is worth coming back."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,They have really good sticky rice with mangoes ! The other day i wanted some badly and cause its a seasonal dessert not all thai restaurants had it at the time but they got me covered. I preordered mine as my schedule was tight and i picked it up after the last order which was 8:30 but they were nice and gave it and accepted to prepare it for me.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Our adventures continue into Santa Barbara, downtown on State street, and my craving for thai food led us to this super tiny restaurant with interesting bright yellow and red decor with blue grey checkerboard tile.  My, what a cornucopia of colors. Yeah, it was all very interesting to take in.  You walk in and there are only a handful of tables, a small waiting area (literally right near the door), and some restrooms and that's it!  I think the place was as big as the living room in my apartment and I live in a 900 sq ft apartment.

Considering there were only a handful of tables, the place was packed.  That's a good sign.  Food must be wonderful, right?  We wanted to take our chances but the hostess was a little rude and almost turned us away because she had nowhere for us to sit and we had no reservations but I insisted on eating there and get my name on a list.  After 20 minutes, we were called in and given the best seat in the place, a lone table facing out the window to view all that Santa Barbara had to offer us.

We started off with water, thai iced tea (it's a must have if you're visiting a thai restaurant!) and coke that arrived with a glass of ice and a real coke can!  None of that fountain drink stuff here.  That in itself was worth noting.  My thai iced tea was the perfect blend of black tea and condensed milk.  

That night, we feasted on Chicken Curry, Chicken Pad Thai, and Chicken Fried Rice with green curry.  Yes, all chicken.  I have yet to develop the rest of my flexitarian (a vegetarian that occasionally eats meat) side.   I expected a brighter yellow sauce for the chicken curry but I'm guessing they did away with the food coloring as an additive and gave us the real deal with the coconut curry.  I appreciate that.  The pad thai was perfect.  Not greasy and just right and the spicy fried rice was the highlight of the night and a burst of flavors for my palate.  

This place is recommended for anyone looking for thai food in the Santa Barbara area.  It's small so make some advance preparations or prepare to wait, either way you won't be disappointed."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My friends and I had a short trip at Santa Barbara yesterday. Coming Zen Yai Thai Cuisine makes our trip more memorable and awesome.
We got Pad Thai with shrimps, Pineapple Fried Rice and Panang Curry. They were amazing dishes. They won't make you who is a fan of Thai's Food disappointed about their dishes.
The second is about the service, that was the best experience ever. They were kindly and friendly. The man in a white shirt, we forgot to ask his name, was super friendly and helpful. When he knew we had a short trip around, he gave us some advice where should we go and what is the most popular.
Thanks for making our trip be perfect."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"This Thai place is sure not authentic. So depends on if you are Asian or not, the experience could be different. I have been in Thailand and tried many places in Orange County, by far this is the least authentic we have been to. The famous Thai Papaya is so disappointing, all I taste was lemon with papaya. I started to loose faith in Yelpers to even give this place 4 stars. 
One of the lady there wasn't really nice to us (prob we were Asian? Cause she seems to be nice to all White ones there). When I ask for fish sauce w chili she said they don't carry Thai chilies, but then the other lady brought to us (by chance) Thai chilies. 
Well, we wont be back for sure!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This place has been on our regular rotation of dining in Santa Barbara. The owner and staff have always been really friendly. Because it is a little bit small inside, make sure to get a reservation ahead of time. The food quality makes it the best thai restaurant hands down. We start with the chicken sate, which is always served piping hot with an excellent peanut sauce. All of the currys are good and the rice is served in a pyramid shape (COOL!) . I love the yellow tofu curry and the noodle dishes are great. Overall, we have never had a bad meal as long as you MAKE A RESERVATION!!!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Great service accommodating us even after calling several times to push back reservation time to accommodate incoming late train. Wonderful food. Would recommend for anyone wanting great thai at reasonable price on State St in Santa Barbara

Recommend the pumpkin curry, excellent!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Delicious egg rolls, and superb pad se ewe. Friendly staff as well. Had a little trouble seating our group of six comfortably."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Was walking down state street and ran into this place. Great customer service and food. Came back 3 times already :)
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"After a long day of walking around State Street, my friends and I decided to get some Thai food to go from this place. 

Minus 1 star because the dude who took our order was super rude. Total attitude with no gratitude. We left with the food in a bad mood. 

The food itself tasted okayyy.. nothing special. We tried the chicken pad thai, beef pad see ew, papaya salad (which reminded me of a korean mu banchan), yellow curry, simple fried rice with chicken, and spicy noodle. The portions were pretty small. They didn't even fill up the styrofoam containers 3/4 of the way! Quality wasn't up there either. And they didn't give us any hot sauce which we really needed because a lot of the food was pretty bland. This place may be known to be pretty good in the SB area but I've definitely had better Thai food in LA and in Thai Town."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I love Zen Yai. No matter what you get here you will be treated to a uniquely layered flavor experience. Everything I have had has tasted fresh. It is consistent as well as my wife and I tend to order the same things with a few bursts of spontaneous divergences from the norms. The waitstaff is very friendly. It is a small restaurant so MAKE RESERVATIONS! It is worth it! Beer and wine selection is ok but if you visit Zen Yai it is truly the food you are here for! Aromatic, unique, flavorful, spicy, savory, amazing!!! Try the Panang Curry, Pad Thai, Egg Rolls, and Thai Ice Tea - you won't be disappointed!!!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The food is really good! A very cute spot ... if you are in Santa Barbara, you need to try it. You will not regret it!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Had an eggplant and basil chicken dish and it did not disappoint. Nothing outstanding Ng but all the basic Thai flavor was there. Small place but not to be judged based on Spaatz. Great service and good  local Thai on State St in Santa Barbara. I'll come back.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Spicy noodle was amazing and we had the best Tom Yum soup in the world. Highly recommend!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"If there's one thing I know in life, it's green curry. Green curry is my favorite meal, and I have gone periods of time where I would eat it two or three times a week. Call me addicted, but it's my favorite. So, when my partner and I were in the area and wanted dinner, I found a local Thai place that would surely hit the spot with a good fixin' of green curry.

Wrong. What I got was milk, vegetables, and sugar. At first I thought I got the wrong thing as soon as I tasted it and the sweetness lingered for several seconds. I told the waitress and one of the women, I believe from the kitchen, came to my table and told me that's how green curry is, it has sugar in it. Okay, fine, maybe it has some sugar in it, but is the primary flavor of the dish supposed to be milky sweet? I don't think so. 

Also, the dish wasn't green, it was white and see through, like milk. The menu itself said that if customers prefer curry without milk, to let the waitstaff know. Doesn't curry usually come with coconut milk, not dairy milk? Even when they brought out a new dish with less sugar, it still tasted like warm milk. They obviously don't use fresh curry, and they don't let the curry cook long enough to soak in the flavors, and this is obvious because they bring out your food less than two minutes after you order.

My boyfriend had ordered the pineapple curry, which he liked, but I tasted it and it was still meh. It was definitely better than the green curry, but still meh. I left the place with a horrible taste in my mouth and a stomach ache."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Great ambiance & food. Relatively cheap as well. Ordered fried rice & spicy noodles. Spicy noodles not that spicy and fried rice is cooked perfectly!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Came here with a couple of friends last night and this place satisfied my thai cravings but it wasn't anything spectacular :/ we got the yellow curry, pad see ew, and pad thai and the portion sizes were pretty small for the price but it was good nonetheless!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Hey to all locals and visitors...Zen Yai is my most favorite place for Thai food. It's small, heavy on atmosphere and great service. Who else has a life size traffic light hanging in the corner of the room and a huge John Lennon poster.  My favorite dish is Spicy Noodles and the Papaya Salad. The owner has the best eyeglasses and such a big smile. She is so appreciative of her patrons.
~Deb"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,I just enjoyed perhaps the most delicious curry dish EVER! I ordered their roasted duck in red curry sauce. The duck was fresh and tasty and the pineapple added the right amount of sweetness to the dish.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"This restaurant changed ownership about a year and a half ago. My coworkers and I used to go to there at least once a week for lunch. Since the change of ownership, by the way I like the new owners, the quality of food is not the same. They have increased their price as well. So now, we probably go there like once a month."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,i order the veggie pad thai through doordash all the time and its always hella bomb. i would recommend if youre craving thai food
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Great place, enjoy the food. Recommend for people who like authentic Thai food! 
Whenever I come to SB, this is the place I go to and have a relaxing night."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Honestly some of the worst Thai food I've had. Dumplings are potstickers that taste no different than frozen grocery-store-bought potstickers. Pad see yew was oily and noodles stuck together. Flavor was bland. Spicy fried rice was ok, but not worth going back for. Your Place remains my favorite Thai restaurant in SB."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Super kind and welcoming hosts :) delicious food! Such a peaceful vibe, highly recommend!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"This is not an authentic Thai restaurant.Nothing special foods except flavor is not greasy. Really disappointed with the Mango sticky rice. The real sticky rice should be soft and glutinous,and the coconut milk is not different from those in market.  A white lady's service was nice."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"First time here and glad we came as it was very good. If we lived in the area, this would be I'd go."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Overall very Bad experience. 

Worst Thai Food & to top it bad service. 
Visiting Santa Barbara from Bay Area where we have a plethora of Thai Restaurants - so we are spoilt with Thai cuisine options the Bay Area has to offer. Nevertheless- based on other reviews - we decided to order take out from Zen Thai. 
- we ordered 
Tom Kha - overpowered by Coconut milk. Lacked the galangal, Kaffir & lemongrass flavors in it. Very watery too. 

Green Curry - very spicy, and again very watery gravy with cut jalapeño in it.  We asked them to keep it as mild as possible. So disappointed. 

Plain vermicelli noodles for our toddler. Over the phone we asked specifically if they have them as our toddler loves it. Instead the take out had flat write noodle! 

To go with the green curry - we ordered 3 serves of rice. Ended up getting just 1 serve!! Since we were staying at a hotel - we couldn't make extra rice so instead ended up having the green curry as a soup! 

Overall very Bad experience!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"On a recent Friday we made some last minute plans to come here for dinner with a party of four. We called ahead and received a reservation for an hour later at 745.  The group shared a tasty tofu appetizer and four entrees and selected from a fine local wine list.  The duck curry and shrimp and mango salad were my favorites, but everything was fresh and flavorful.  The chef stopped by to check in on us and gifted us a delicious creme brulee.  I have only been here a few times over the years....now I will incorporate it into my routine as my favorite Thai / Thai Fusion restaurant in Santa Barbara."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Zen Yai is a consistently delicious place to order Thai food. My favorites are their Yellow Curry, and their Pad See Ewe-- make sure and get the spice tray as no trip to a Thai place is complete without a little bit of spice!

My one complaint keeping this from a 5 star review is that the lunch specials are about the same price as the regular entrees for a similar amount of food (less of the entree, but you get a side salad)

Next time I'll order the full entree at lunch and skip the salad-- since I'll end up with more of the entree that way."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"As a SoCal resident and someone who has been to Thailand, I DO NOT recommend this Thai restaurant. I went to it after reading that it's the best Thai restaurant in Santa Barbara. I checked on yelp and it seemed as if many people really like it, so I decided to try it. It's nowhere near authentic. I came with three other people. Three of us ordered Thai tea and the other one ordered Thai lemon iced tea. The beverages were pretty good. We ordered the Tom yum soup with shrimp, the simple fried rice with beef, and barbecue chicken. The fried rice was alright, I've definitely had better at different Thai restaurants, which are way more authentic. The Tom yum soup was no good, it was way too bland. I felt as if I had some water with lemon and pepper in it. I was absolutely disappointed. Last but not least, the barbecue chicken wasn't appealing to my taste buds. I couldn't even figure out what seasoning the chicken was marinated with. The chicken was too dry and after a few bites, it became VERY sickening. 

The service was alright. The people working there weren't helpful. We were standing by the table before they finished cleaning it and the woman rudely asked that we stand outside so she could finish it. 

Overall, I didn't have a good first impression and I didn't have too great of an experience. I thought it was very Americanized and I do not and would not recommend it."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Zen Yai has the best Pad Thai in Santa Barbara. It's a staple for my fiancée and I - two orders of Pad Thai and two Thai Iced Teas!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We stopped by for dinner on a Saturday. The place looked v cute and clean. Got seated pretty quickly as it was not a busy weekend.

Place cleanliness: Excellent 
Quality of food: Excellent 
Quality of service: Quick and Courteous 
Ambience: V cute 
Price for quality: very good 
Things that I liked: being a vegetarian I have tried their Pineapple fried rice and Yellow Curry, both were really good. Quantity was just perfect for us.
Suggestions: Definitely try out their pineapple fried rice if you are vegetarian or vegan! And if you can handle ask for a spicy one"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Where's the flavor??? 

My boyfriend & I ordered the veggie pad Thai and tofu red curry for takeout. This was our first time eating at this restaurant - we decided to try it since we frequent most other Thai restaurants in town, saw it's great reviews and wanted to try something new and delicious. However, what we received was quite the opposite: the extremely dry, flavorless pad Thai had few veggies, all of which were hardly cooked and lacked moisture; and a very bland curry tasting only of coconut milk, it truly seemed like there was hardly any curry paste at all, with very few additions listed on the menu included. 

Overall, I am THOROUGHLY disappointed in our meal. This is, without a doubt, the worst Thai food I've had in Santa Barbara. I've worked in Thai restaurants in the past and know Thai food well, but even to the untrained palette, this meal was just flat out bad. Can't believe we spent over $30 for this sh**. 

I'm not writing this review out of anger, only as a precaution to those seeking to enjoy real, tasty Thai food. :/"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Seriously the best Thai food in all of Santa Barbara County! The owner Jennifer is so welcoming, kind and the entire staff takes care of you. The food is to die for and I am always craving my Thai tofu curry and pineapple fried rice.

I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Hellllllla good and such good and friendly service. The soup hot at first, but don't get me wrong, it cooled down with time. Don't get me started on the Pad See Ew- so yummy! Wow, what a night! Will definitely return soon :)"

I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"The pumpkin curry was great, thanks for the Yelp recommendations, but even more so I enjoyed the subtler flavors of the shrimp in a clay pot, with delicious mushrooms and plenty of shrimp, perfectly cooked.  Fantastic flavors, fantastic service."

Shu-Mai Pork Dumplings were amazing.

Solid 3.5 stars, an additional half star for the hand lotion in the clean restroom."

We got the spring rolls, pumpkin chicken curry, red curry, fried rice, drunken noodles, dumplings, basically everything you can imagine and it was delicious!!!! ZenYai Thai has been my main Thai food place here in Santa Barbara and it never lets me down. The flavor is wonderful and it's one of the only Thai places that offers my favorite dish- pumpkin curry! 10/10 recommend and the Thai tea is delicious, I'm so sad i didn't take pictures of our feast but I guarantee you will love what you order"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Went as a group of five and was thoroughly disappointed through and through. 

Mostly, I was put off by the service and then the food. We had to specifically ask for water and when we did, the waitress got the order (FOR WATER) wrong. Come on!!!

She had a very brusque attitude towards us the entire time and when I found hair in my dessert (which she explained was coconut brush... which doesn't make it much better let's be honest), she replied, ""So what do you want me to do about it?"" 

Could I have a half order at least, please? I don't think that's too much to ask for.

Then the papaya salad, priced pretty high for such a small portion, was so small in portion size compared to what I've had in Hawaii for almost half the price. Aiyaaaa!!!

At the end of the day, the food doesn't look nor did it taste appetizing according to the people I came with. Portions are small. Slightly overpriced.

The only redeeming factor is the fried banana/coconut ice cream. $7 for a pretty small portion but it tasted good nonetheless. If only I didn't find hair/""coconut brush""..."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Authentic Thai food. The Pad Thai, red curry chicken and the papaya salad are all yummy
Highly recommended."

The staff were super friendly and the food was top notch without being expensive. I would recommend this place and would come again!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Excellent food great service. I'm found this place on a whim and so glad I did!
Go here get the curry and make sure you're able to get a Thai iced tea!

I love a pad thai, but so many places make them so heavy, this was crisp and bright flavored- so good."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,this place is amazing! came here for dinner and everything was really good. I loved the seafood noodles and duck curry was great. 100% will come again!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Zen Yai is hands down the best Thai food in Santa Barbara. Their garlic pepper tofu and tom yum is amazing. The atmosphere is always very relaxed and the food comes out quickly. The value is unbeatable. The service is also the best in town - Erica is extremely kind and attentive. Can't say enough about this place.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Cute little Thai restaurant in downtown. The waiter was very kind and kept checking back on us. The food came out pretty quickly, probably because there weren't many people when I went. I got the chicken and shrimp pad Thai. I was surprised because usually pad Thai comes with one choice of protein, but it comes with both chicken and shrimp here! The shrimp was really good. The pad Thai was good too, but I've definitely had better elsewhere. The noodles weren't that flavorful, but they were still good. I was kind of sad that there weren't many bean sprouts or any tofu like pad Thai typically has, but This still satisfies my Thai cravings. The portions were also huge!! I would come back to try their green curry."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Great food, polite and helpful staff, easy parking in a public lot less than half a block away and great food (did I mention great food??)"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"They took orders during covid and handled their establishment well during these trying times, with outdoor seating limited to 3 tables outside along the sidewalk and take out. We had dinner at the table outside after ordering at the door. Food came out fast and service was decent. We were able to request level of spiciness for our order and I thought it was a decent meal. The egg rolls as appetizer were pretty good with the sweet and sour sauce it came with. All in all a decent place for Thai food by our hotel beachside"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"First off, their tom yum soup and Panang curry were top notch! I'm not exaggerating when I say that this tom yum soup is the best I have ever had -- it was fragrantly soothing with the right amount of tang. They also don't hold back on the spice, which I definitely appreciated! Our Panang curry was very spicy, but the spice didn't compromise the pleasantly mellow and creamy taste in any way (and if you don't want your food to be that spicy, you can always ask them to adjust the spice level and they will gladly do so). Other highlights were the Thai curry noodles, the pineapple fried rice, and the pad Thai. Secondly, the service was amazing! We came at a really busy hour, and even then, they were so sweet and gracious throughout. In fact, the waiter and waitress serving us that day actually stopped by our table and had great conversations with us once the chaos died down a little. I loved how personable and friendly they were! Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Zen Yai and will definitely come here again the next time I'm in town."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Service was great and food was mighty tasty! I had the pad see ew with fried tofu

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I'm not super happy with paying $14 for a portion of this small size. Normally I'll go to a Thai restaurant and they'll give me double the food for the same price. So if I'm looking for a Thai spot with good value, I probably won't be returning to Zen Yai."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,Food was cold and tastes like it has been made hours ago. Had high hopes but probably won't be visiting again :/
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Today is 4/24/2020.
Update: no shrimp, no scallops, no white fish.
So sad.. cuz that was what I wanted to order to go.

:/

Please upload a new menu on here."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Got the fried calamari, fried tofu, pad thai, and fried rice. All were pretty good and the fried foods weren't greasy or felt heavy. The service was exemplary -- honestly I'd recommend them just from our experience with the waitress who seemed to be the only one working at the front."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This review is for Zen Yai after the change of ownership (I came in Sept 20th 2018)
I would rate 4 star for food, 5 star for the service. The food is good, not wow, typical Santa Barbara Thai food scene I would say. What impressed me was the hospitality from the owner as well as the staff member. They are really attentive, polite and welcoming. The restaurant is still waiting for the transfer of alcohol license so there is no alcohol being served at this moment. 
We ordered the spring rolls, it was fresh, the sauce was good, however it's rather skimmed and loosely wrapped. We also had Tom Kha soup and pineapple fried rice. They were both delicious. 
The decoration is minimal, a little bland. Understandably, they are adjusting from being brand new so we see how it goes. Overall, I will come back and support their business"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Friendly staff, fresh ingredients, charming vibe. I got the pad Thai and loved it, wasn't oily but was full of flavor. My daughter got the gyoza (potstickers) and LOVED them. We will be back!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"We ordered Pad Woon Sen with chicken, and the flavor is delicious!  Our son likes the Fried Calamari because he said the batter flavor is good compared to other places.  It was no meat Friday but menu crossed out all the salmon dishes, and there was no fish on menu...hence we knocked off one star."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Had dinner here this past Sun for the first time. The food tasted fresh and had good flavors. Not very strong seasoning but good enough. It's very small & dark inside and had a packed house when we arrived.  Only thing off putting was there was a giant moth flying around and kept pestering us. 
The yellow curry chicken had a nice flavor although mild yet the chicken was hard to pull out in the dish compared to the large chunks of potatoes.  The Pad Thai noodles were okay as well - There was supposed to be shrimp and chicken in the order and we had only 2 pieces of shrimp in the entire dish and a few pieces of chicken.  The veggies and the moistness of the noodles were good.  We had a scallop dish as well that I believe was called Garlic Scallop - they were not seasoned very well and was a quite boring dish overall.
Compared to the Thai we are used to getting here in the Bay Area I would say this place is just OK - I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone or return myself even though the experience was decent, the food just wasn't as flavorful or anything like I would expect from traditional thai dishes we ordered since it was our first visit."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,WOW. This was my first experience eating Thai food. It was delicious...we even ordered more food because it was so good. I can't remember the name of the dishes we ordered...one of them was pad thai. Definitely coming back.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Very nice dining environment and great food!!! Love this place and definitely recommend it!!!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Excellent food. All dishes were good. Just make sure to ask if the curries you are ordering(if you are ordering more than one) have a different enough flavor profile. Our two curries were quite similar. The eggplant basil + spring rolls were great. The service from the lady and gentleman were absolutely top notch. My mom accidentally left her purse in the restaurant and they came chasing us across the street in order to return it. Was just stopping thru town but will hopefully come back next time we are in Santa Barbara
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This is my new go-to Thai food restaurant in the SB area!! SO SO SO good; every plate is absolutely delicious. The pad thai was the perfect texture and amount of peanut sauce, the yellow chicken curry (my favorite food) was flavorful and satisfying, the panang curry was hearty and a beautiful creamy orange color, the coconut drink that I ordered with the meal was fresh and delicious, the mango sticky rice was a perfectly sweet finish to the meal... Definitely coming here again soon! I'd say the only thing I wouldn't reorder would be the pineapple fried rice; it was super tasty, but felt more like something I could whip up at home, so I'd put my money towards more yellow chicken curry or mango sticky rice. 

Plus, the service was pretty quick, they've got a spacious outdoor seating area, and the decorations and paintings are beautiful. Thank you Zen Yai! Can't wait to be back."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Zen Yai is the only Thai restaurant in SB suitable for a date. They have a rare late night menu on Friday or Saturdays which I've never tried but in a town where if you're hungry for a real meal at 10:30 or 11:00, you're SOL, this is noteworthy. 

The Thai beef salad is about the best I've ever eaten. I MUCH prefer Thai to Chinese and as the years pass, I have less and less interest in Chinese food unless it's fine dining Chinese like Chin Chin in Manhattan (49th and 3rd across from legendary steakhouse Smith and Wollensky). I eat Thai probably once a week but my boyfriend and I don't come here as often as the local hole in the wall--though it's not much more expensive--because it's on State Street in downtown and parking can be a bit of a pain. 

The food is outstanding and slightly more sophisticated--with quite a few appetizer and entree specials on the board each night--than Your Place (see my review) or Your Choice, in San Roque area of SB. I don't know why Thai restaurants are always visually disturbing but of the Thais in SB, this is the best-looking. Of course it's very dark so if it were as ghastly as either of the other popular Thai restaurants, one wouldn't notice! 

The spicy beef noodles are a must and far less oily than the version at Your Place. 

I haven't been here in a year so do not remember the other entrees we usually order but this is a great place. They have okay wines by the glass but the corkage is probably low and the service is friendly and accommodating so I'm sure you could bring in a decent bottle of wine without being hassled too much."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Ordered take-out at the counter from what seemed to be a really nice young gentleman who seemed as if he'd been out in the sun all day long (if you know what I mean) and asked to wait 15-20 minutes for the 4 appetizers we ordered.  We walked around a bit & came back to be told that they just got a bunch of online orders & he would call me in 15 minutes (I never gave my cell #)- we opted to wait out front. ONE HOUR LATER--still waiting (watching people sit/order/eat/leave).  2 others queued up and were given their takeout order.  THEN the waitress asked me to review my receipt and pointed to the line item that showed the extra $2 add-on for shrimp to the Spring Rolls- I was asked to pay the $8.95 that the young man neglected to charge me.  Seriously? after waiting ONE HOUR for 4 APPETIZERS and TIPPING 20% ?  NO. I told her to cancel the spring rolls and was told that they were already made. I said NO again. I was told- okay, we'll give them to you anyway. Then I waited another 5 minutes or so....OMG!!  The appetizers were super cold -fried tofu (yuck); chicken satay (cold); gyoza-lukewarm; springrolls-delicious. Only giving this place 2 starts b/c springrolls were really good and I can see how this place would have been excellent if personnel had it together. A good establishment would have apologized, not said a word about the springrolls and offered a comp dish or dessert.  Buyer beware."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Loved the food. The family enjoyed it. The service was with a smile. Penang curry, veg fried rice and Tom yum soup were all great..

Pud Thai was great too.

The place is a bit small, but comfortable. The price is fine too."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Best Thai food in Santa Barbara  the pad see ewe and the pad Thai are amazing and the friendliest service  go to
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Just came to this place for the second time and had a terrible experience. I came with a few of my friends and one of them wasn't happy with their Order. The waitress argued with my friend and was hesitant to replace her order. The food was good overall, yet the customer service was uncomparable. Also at the end I wrote no tip on the check for the inconvenience and the guy with glasses at the front asked me why I didn't tip them, Which was unnecessarily rude. Definitely not impressed.

P.S. They are are super slow! Don't come here if you're in a hurry"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,The pad Thai sauce does not taste like the pad Thai sauce that makes pad Thai glorious.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I can't even! BEST veggie fried rice I've ever eaten!!!  Been craving veggie fried rice and so glad we ended up here, as my partner felt like pad thai.  Anyway like I said, this was the best fried rice I've had. 
  The service was awesome.  Our waitress was sooo goood. Very personable and friendly. The place is supes cute and our table for two right in the front window was nice. 
  Ya!  You should go here. GO!!!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"It's a decent Thai restaurant, but I wouldn't travel near and far for it. The decor is cute, and it makes for a really intimate setting, albeit the seating area is very small, so you may accidentally bump shoulders with the person sitting at the table behind you. 

I can only speak for the street food as that's what we ordered. The Pad Thai is pretty good, but I do have to say it was a bit more expensive than expected because the quality didn't warrant the price, but I guess any restaurant on State street is going to have to find a way to compensate that expensive rent anyway, right? The fried rice was decent, but my boyfriend really didn't like the taste - it was more bland than other Thai places and the rice just seemed a bit under cooked. 

The service was quick and friendly, no complaints there! 

Overall, if you want Thai on State street because you don't want to drive to the innards of Santa Barbara to find the other Thai restaurants, then this is an ideal place. But if you're willing to go to other areas in SB, then I would suggest trying out other Thai restaurants."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,First time here and I was not disappointed! I love Thai food and this was definitely top quality food and service. Looking forward to coming back!
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Food was not good, the Pad Thai was dry and not flavorful, the Eggplant Basil was ok (I've had many better ones before) and the Red Curry was not good either.  The Red Curry had the frozen mixed vegetables that you see often in stores that is made to easily boil/microwave (contains carrots, peas, corn and lima beans), which to me when I see that in a restaurant just shows that they don't prioritize  quality and freshness of their food.  We were disappointed.  The only good thing is its location."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Nice place. I loved shrimp fried rice and Tum kho. Service was fine requested a heater that was pulled next to me
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Zen Yai was my favorite Thai restaurant in SB for many years but I have not been back for about 3 years. This was my first time visiting Zen Yai since the change of ownership. 

My first impression being back is that little has changed. Still a romantic and intimate little Thai resto with sweet servers and good food. 

The interior is a bit different gone are the vintage picture of John Lennon and the funky red walls which have been replaced with more traditional Thai decor and serene blue paint. 

I ordered the red curry and the poor man's noodles. I asked for both spicy, but I don't think that's what I got. I may have a high tolerance to spicy food ( actually I do) but the food I received seem at normal spice level. 

The red curry was fresh but a bit too heavy ( full fat coco milk used maybe) for my taste. I do remember this dish being more flavorful before and ultimately had to ask for a bit of soy sauce and chili to kick it up a notch. 

The poor mans noodles on the other hand were a bit too salty for my taste but exceedingly delicious and authentic. My one request would have been to have cooked the ground meet a little more- I say this because my dish came out way too fast for my comfort level of the appropriate amount of time it should take to cook- I felt it was underdone and this became a distraction. Otherwise everything was very good! 

I would definitely recommend this small local business, but they could stand to take a few  suggestions from the many reviewers, namely : more unique decor ( bring back Lennon!) , lighten the curry thickness and add some flavor. 

That being said it is in the top 3 Thai restaurants in Santa Barbara so I will be back for a cute date!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Small, intimate restaurant with so many options, I definitely recommend coming with a group to eat family style. Pretty reasonable price, clean place, and exceptional service. 
I ordered the Green Curry, Pad Thai, and seasonally offered mango sticky rice! (This was enough to stuff two people) Everything was colorful and smelled great. 
The green curry with chicken was so flavorful and creamy, and had a touch of spice to it. If you are planning on sharing it with more than 2 people, get an extra side of rice :) 
The Pad Thai with pork was recommended to us by the waitress, and I am so glad I ordered it! 
Mango sticky rice is a must have!! Perfectly ripe mango pairs perfectly with their subtly sweet and warm sticky rice. I will order this every time I come, for sure.
Wish I had the stomach space to try their pineapple fried rice and appetizers! Will come again"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Ordered some Pad Woon Sen for takeout in my hotel room,  I must say, the PWS exceeded my expectations.  It was flavorful and a delight with every mouthful.   The glass noodles and vegetables had the  right amount of chew.  It was such a satisfying meal.  Thumbs up to the chef!"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Absolutely delightful Thai food in a sort of funky settting (which is saved by the low lights... I suspect this place in bright lighting would be depressing).  Sit beneath the John Lennon painting in the back, or by the scroll of paper on the wall that lists the specials - it all feels like an interesting mix of homemade and funky.  Everything that we sampled was really good (and please note, Thai is not one of my favorite cuisines - it has become so standardized that it feels like everywhere you go, you end up with a plate of mushy pad thai or pad see ewe) but particularly noteable is the poor man's noodles - it actually tasted like a mix of Vietnamese and Thai food - wide, flat rice noodles served with ground chicken, diced bell pepers, diced bamboo, and lots of bean sprouts.  If you're out on State St, Zen Yai is a reasonably priced and very tasty option."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I had my first try at Thai food here and I am so thankful I did because I had been terrified of exploring my palette into Thai and I was able to try numerous items to experience and I have no regrets into trying it!
The service is super close to home culture, you feel very welcome and appreciated so it makes for great energy. The place was also really great to look at and have that extra authentic feel of a family owned direct restaurant. First timer or not it's worth checking out the food and culture for sure ."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Very good Thai food. One star deduction for overworked servers, meaning poor service. One server for 11 tables is not enough."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I really love this place! Great quality food and friendly and prompt service :) my favorite Thai place in the area forsure! My favorites are Panang Curry, pad Thai, and spicy noodles"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"I like this place. It's fresh and not too heavy/ greasy and it's really flavorful. My go-to Thai restaurant in town. Their outdoor dining parklet is perfectly adequate despite not being entirely in the car-free footprint of State St. My kiddos love their fried tofu and chicken sate. I like their pad Thai, vegan summer rolls, and egg rolls (the vinegar sauce is addictive). They are fast with takeout if you call ahead. 

For my eco-nut takeout ""packaging police"" report: I give them a grade of B-. They don't use plastic clamshells in their takeout food which I really appreciate, they instead use lined paper boxes and place a small piece of foil in the bottom. They ask before providing plastic cups of condiments, they don't include plastic utensils unless requested, if you have multiple items they may be placed in a single use plastic bag. Overall, one of the least wasteful takeout options in town."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"First time ordering from this place and it did not disappoint! Food is delicious and they're very attentive to their customers. I placed an order through DoorDash and anxiously awaited for the food to arrive. Some time after the quoted time for food delivery, no food, and no update on the DoorDash page, I proceeded to call the Dasher who did not answer. My coworker then proceeded to call the restaurant to make sure our order had actually reached the restaurant. It had. The person who answered was very kind and said he was trying to keep the food warm and had placed the iced tea in the fridge since our Dasher had not arrived yet. I was so grateful for such awesome customer service on behalf of the restaurant and was even more thankful after they left a note with our food. Since we ordered through DoorDash the restaurant does not control the quoted time delivery, they just know when the Dasher will arrive, who apparently was running late. Needless to say it was a kind gesture for something out of their control. Definitely recommend."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"Buddy & I were looking for a yummy spot to celebrate a fun day of sightseeing & Zen Yai Thai was open early....

Thank goodness we ventured over there soon as they opened.  We literally got the 2nd to last table, the last was quickly occupied right after, & then it was a line of people for the remainder of our time there.....*popular*!

( I think people stop by here before hitting the movie theater across the street & maybe that's why it's so crowded )

Teeny Tiny kitchen - you need to be prepared to wait for your food to come out

Started w/ the Spring Rolls - these are the fried kind & came w/ this clear, syrupy plum sauce.  Buddy actually thought they had forgotten to give us the right sauce b/c it was clear & she's used to a purple-pinky color.  Aside from the sauce confusion, the rolls were okay - shredded cabbage & carrots all fried up - what's not to like?

Of course my choice was the Pumpkin Curry - it's THE thing to get at Zen Yai & who was I to go against the current?  Okay flavor & the usual ingredients (pumpkin, tofu, carrots, peppers).  Would have preferred it a bit more spicy but the flavor was still creamy & pumpkinny & good

Buddy got the Pad Thai w/ Chicken & was mildly impressed - she liked it okay but was not wowed & since Pad Thai is the standard, go-to thai dish we always get, there's a high bar here

Speaking of bar.....ordered the sake & can say you'll want to pass on this one - added nothing to the dining experience & had a bitter taste.  I'll be the 1st to admit I'm no connoisseur when it comes to sake but I do remember a sweet, warming quality that was lacking here

Verdict?  We thought everything was A-OK.  Might come back but would probably check out other options before"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Our order was delivered in 30 minutes (ten minutes early!) and was very tasty. I would recommend highly. The chicken larb was especially delicious.
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Stopped in one evening, no wait, got outside table, Ordered 2 curry dishes, sorry forgot exactly which ones: think orangish one (pineapple and shrimp) and whitish one (pumpkin and chicken) white and brown rice, Thai ice teas.  Food came out relatively quick. All food very good quality.  Liked the pineapple chicken little better.
Will be back again."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"i've been really craving thai food and i've not have thai food in santa barbara. however, everything here is kind of subpar to me sadly (i say this as in i have had better) in a way, everything here is weirdly healthy??? still, i think they have a decent pad thai! their pineapple fried rice was just kind of plain and looks a little sad and not colorful. to be real idk how this stuff is cooked ""authentically"" but there's just something off about it. the egg roll was good, just a good ol egg roll. and their papaya salad was also okay! their curry was also okay i think everything was okay and i'm not mad at it just a little sad
their service is good! the ladies are super cute and they r the reason why i would go back"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"My family was here for my brothers wedding and called last minute for dinner at 5:30 p.m. with 19 people. The restaurant was great. The food was great and the services was great. I think we all had a wonderful time. We also took up almost the whole restaurant. they usually only seat about 30 people.

We recommend this restaurant.

Thank you!

I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,This is an awesome Thai spot on state! The pineapple curry was fantastic and the vegan summer rolls were impressive. I definitely plan to return. Customer service was also 5/5
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,negative,"If you are looking for bland Americanized thai, go for this place. Look else where for genuine Thai flavors

Diluted flavors
Mediocre service
Crowded small restaurant
Small portions relative to price"
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"OK straight up, I have been to Thailand 4 times and I can not find food greater that Zen Yai outside of Thailand.  As for some of the other reviews, HA, you have no idea of good Thai food, or even how to order it.  Ask any Thai person and they will tell you a good Thai restaurant is rated on two dishes, Tom Yum, and Phad Thai.  And for others, well, you have just been eating bad Thai.  Trust me I am a foodie who has worked in the industry for well over 20 years. The food is very fresh, organic, and spicy, most dishes are authentic and some are fusion.  If your a tourist visiting Santa Barbara don't believe half the crap your hotel concierge tells you.  Most of them are just young kids going to school here and they just go off what they see on walls and reviews of the local rag called ""The Independent"" (IE. weekly for you SF and LA/OC peeps).  Everyone in town will most likely tell you that Your Place is the best on Milpas street....WRONG!  Just because they win the Indy award every year does not make them the best, a little secret, you have to pay for an add to win the Indy award...hmmm, sounds like a rigged election if you ask me.  If you like dusty old dank Thai that is just boring go to Your Place, go on go ahead, it makes more room for me at Zen Yai, cause they only have 10 tables.  I highly recommend you make a reservation and if you have a group of 8 or more, you may want to order out.  Its reasonable priced and great place for a romantic dinner date.  The pumpkin curry is spicy and great with the kabocha squash.  Also the Curry Noodles are insane good, order it with ground pork, its not offered that way on the menu but they will make it for you. Also try the specials.  Some say that the food here is not totally Thai, and yea some dishes are not, but the Chef knows what she is doing and makes a series of fusion dishes that you will never find anywhere else.  They have all the staples thought too, and Chang beer, my favorite Thai beer.  They serve loose teas and a twist on some desserts such as sticky rice and mango made with a sweet sticky black rice.  Oh and for you boring folks who order Phad Thai every time you go to a Thai place, well your either gonna love the PT here because it is so dam close to what PT should taste like ( and look like, slightly red) or your going to hate it because you have been eating PT that has no color or flavor. Learn your Thai food kids.  I have eaten at many Thai places in LA and SFand there ares some good ones, but Zen Yai, hands down the best in town. Oh and for you late night foodies, you have to come back here after hours 11:30 to 2:30 am for the Blue Owl.  The best late night food, try the fried rice with tri tip, or any of the sandwhiches.  If you cant get in here try the Mueng Fun on the mesa, they are pretty good too."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,Tonight was my first time back to this wonderful Thai food restaurant in a long time and I don't know why it took me so long to visit. The remodel offers a new and well designed atmosphere for comfortable eating. The background music was very pleasant. I ordered to go and the gentleman that helped me at the front was very informed and answered all my questions regarding making my choice for food. The pad Thai noodles I What I ordered and it was full of flavor and the potion size was awesome. I will most definitely be back many times. Great food. Great customer service and clean and inviting atmosphere
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"This place was great! We ate here after meeting some friends at the SB Rock Gym across the street (great way to refuel after a session). They were able to house a reservation for us a few hours earlier and our table was ready and waiting a few minutes before our reservation time. Yay for quick seating!

Honestly some of the best Thai food I have had (definitely top 5). I had the rad na and the gravy wasn't too sweet or salty. I, unfortunately, have had both extremes but it was seasoned perfectly. Beef was of good quality (didn't taste old/too tenderized/cheap). My plate was about $11. A little more than I anticipated, but for being on State St in Santa Barbara, I should have expected that.

Friends had Tom Yum soup, spicy noodles, pad thai, pad see ewe and the curry noodles. Everyone loved their meals. I didn't try them out because I was so full, but the food looked like it was cooked well and had big portions. A lot of options and vegan/vegetarian friendly. I'd recommend it to my friends! Walk up the street and enjoy some McConnell's ice cream for dessert afterwards!

ps: A little on the smaller side (probably seats 20 comfortably)."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Zen Yai is a consistently delicious place to order Thai food. My favorites are their Yellow Curry, and their Pad See Ewe-- make sure and get the spice tray as no trip to a Thai place is complete without a little bit of spice!

One note: lunch specials are about the same price as the regular entrees for a similar amount of food (less of the entree, but you get a side salad)

Next time I'll order the full entree at lunch and skip the salad-- since I'll end up with more of the entree that way."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,American,positive,"Good Pad Thai. I admire the fact that when I requested ""Very Spicy,"" it REALLY was spicy! At the same time, the spice did not take away the pleasant sweet nutty flavor of Pad Thai. My takeout order came with two large wedges of lime and an extra side of chili sauce. Yes, I dumped the entire thing in - no regrets! I docked one star because it was slightly on the dry side (hence my sauce madness). My choice of protein with this dish was pork which was also a tad dry - so I highly recommend getting chicken or tofu instead! I'm looking forward to a dine in experience here where I can try several items in the menu that really caught my eye - especially Tom Yum Soup and coconut ice cream. Tune in for updates!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"While you might think the relentless aural onslaught of Jack Johnson's greatest hits provided by the mall dueling it out with the upbeat post-techno coming out of this years trendy sweatshop fed fashion house might be off putting... instead they provide the perfect soundtrack for another dystopic capitalist hell scape!!

Ten minutes spent here watching the pinks dole out  the cabbage (credit fueled natch) that drives our massive narcissistic nightmare factory of a civilization closer and closer to the abyss is worth 10 classes the best school of deconstructivist studies.


There is nothing but the screaming of temperature differentials in the echoing void of chaos."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"This place is getting to a point that you have fewer stores for clothing or shoe shopping. Also, stores keep changing, can't keep up with the recent stores!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Its a nice out door shopping mall but the parking is a problem.
its a nice place to go see a movie in.

There is not that many restaurants there cause they can't afford to pay the high rent, but fast food places can afford the high rent."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,Great place to chill and stroll around while window shopping in S.B. It's quiet and very slow paced so no unpleasant experiences here. They have some pretty cool shops but the place is rather small so don't expect too much variety. I guess the locals prefer it that way?
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"I haven't been to this shopping center maybe since 2012 during the summer, when my friend was renting an apartment out in Santa Barbara.  I always remember the Paseo Nuevo outdoor mall to be something special -- and it is, especially during Christmas time.

It's all lit up right now with twinkling lights everywhere.  There are a lot of great shops and places to sit.  It feels very safe for two young people to go walking around at night -- I even felt safe going to my car by myself at 10PM.  The security guards here are on point and make you feel really safe, so thanks!

Only con is bathroom is on the second floor and the elevator is out.  I couldn't find the other location for the bathroom so I just trekked up the stairs, but this would be difficult if you were in a wheel chair.  Would be nice to have a bathroom on the first floor."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Spanish-style courtyards, flowers everywhere, it's a beautiful place to go and visit especially if you're a tourist. They have over 50shops and restaurants. Not only is it in the heart of State street, you have TONS of other shops and restaurants surrounding. Though parking can be a pain and be careful, it's full of one wall streets so get directions. They have stores like nordstorms, cafe orleans, victoria's secret, angl, bebe, nine west. I love going up to santa barbara, b/c of all the different types of restaurants and shops they have, and you can even head straight to the beach after wards. There is a restaurant they have in Nordstorms that's on the top floor and you can eat outside on a balcony that over looks santa barbara, though the resturant isn't the greatest, the view is great. On a nice day out, state street including the paseo nuevo mall is the best. Can't go wrong, anyone can find something there."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,One of the best outdoor mall I have been too. It has a European feel atmosphere and definitely felt like I was in another country. Down the street has a stream of restaurants and bars. Ideal place for bar hopping.
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"This is a great place to come in Santa Barbara for shopping. You can walk up or down State St. and check out the stores and even go down to the harbor. Paseo Nuevo is neat because they keep the place clean and it looks kind of classy. I don't find the stores to be pretty unique, but it can be a good place to take a breather during a day of walking and shopping. Parking is pretty convenient as there is a big garage."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"One of the prettiest malls from the outside however there aren't many stored there that I frequented when I went to UCSB.  Now State street has had an Extreme Makeover.  Tons of brand names stores right on State like Juicy (but who really shops there now? even though I think there stuff is adorable), surf shops galore and Betsey Johnson."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Fun outdoor shopping center with lots of stores.  In the heart of downtown Paseo Nuevo/State Street you will find a variety of stores including Nordrstrom, Macy's, Gap, Victoria Secret, T Mobile and many other vendors including restaurants (one that is open late, until 10 p.m.) and even a 4-plex movie theater!  

Free parking for the first 45 minutes."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"The mall itself was fine - a lovely outdoor Spanish-style mall with a theater and a museum upstairs.  Then they hired Caruso to take over and I hate it.  Since when does Santa Barbara need a security guard at a mall?  WTF??  The guy looks bored to tears.  I don't feel like walking up to a uniformed guard for directions.  I want to see a friendly, smiling customer service person.  And the music just doesn't fit here, I'm just not in the mood for Sinatra while shopping in Santa Barbara - I associate that with their other malls.  This kind of stuff is literally driving me away from a mall I used to love.

I like that there's a Sephora and Aveda.  But I could seriously do without those nasty businesses that want to grab you by the hand for a massage and talk you into their crap beauty stuff.  I've been harassed by those people endlessly and it makes me not want to walk by them.  Going to a mall should be fun and relaxing and it's just not.

The Nordy's and Macy's can't quite compare to the best stores in the Greater Los Angeles Area.  Also, they need a Hollister.  Kids from Santa Maria are driving all the way to the LA area for shopping.  The Macy's at the old mall, La Cumbre Plaza, is bigger & better."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Normally, I hate shopping. The crowd, the dizzy spells, the claustrophobia.... Not here. With this beautiful outdoor mall, I can shop here all day. If you're going to have to update that wardrobe, why not do it under beautiful sunny California beach weather? Cool, breezy, clear skies and gucci baby."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"I love this mall.. Open air and a variety of wonderful shops. Feels like I'm in Europe. And if you need any help, the young lady in guest services, Michaella is especially nice and helpful. Very professional and positive young lady."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Gorgeous Spanish buildings. It's an outside mall with all of the necessities. It has my fav: ANGL, Nordstrom, Juicy and Sephora....

A few blocks away is Saks Fifth Ave which is always nice to go to for the latest styles.

Overall it's a beautiful city and a beautiful mall. It's the best to go to when they have the farmers market out.

MISS IT!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"This is a nice outdoor shopping mall. I don't recall buying anything, but my GF got a couple of cheap items from Cotton-On. It's located right in downtown Santa Barbara on State Street and the weather was perfect for a Sunday afternoon. The area in general is a great place to grab something to eat and people watch."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"My husband and I recently attended the Paseo Paws Pet Pawty with our two chihuahuas.  We had a blast!  Not only had the mall added fun family games like foozball, giant chess, etc. all over the center of the mall, this Pet Pawty was so fun and we got a chance to meet some friendly new dogs.  

As Yelp Elite, we were all invited to enjoy some free appetizers and sodas on the Eureka Burger patio.  Our dogs were comfortable on the patio and all over in the mall in fact!  We noticed that many store fronts had bowls of water at their front door for our dogs to grab a splash of water before we went in and shopped.  

The Pet Pawty itself was also a great time! Our dogs got free dental assessments, lots of healthy snacks and so much play time with all of their new friends who also attended the pawty!!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"I work in this mall.....

Good selection of stores, with a few new ones opening up soon. I feel safe working and shopping there. I honestly don't know why it is open past 7pm during the week though.....even in Summer, the place is dead at night. 

Nordstroms is great, Macy's is straight up depressing though. It is the saddest Macy's I have ever been in to.

People who work in those little huts are annoying as hell. No, I do not want your fake cigarettes/dead sea spa items/crapy hair straightener."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,Very nice outdoor mall! Santa Barbara is amazing and this mall takes advantage of it. Lots of selection
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"This shopping center is beautiful!

Though it's an hour bus ride away, I am happy to have it. I was so nervous about getting supplies since the only thing we have near the university is Kmart. I went here for the first time during College Night Out, and was blown away by the beauty of the lights! It is so picturesque. If you're from the Bay, I would compare Paseo Nuevo to Santana Row.

The shops range from affordable to pricey. It's a nice place to spend a day shopping. I took my family here when they were visiting, and though it's not as pretty in the daytime, it was still nice to walk around. Some of the vendors can be aggressive.

If you're going along State Street and want to shop, come here. Don't go if you're easily bored!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"One of the most amazing shopping centers ever! Especially when the weather is nice! Movie theaters, all the top name stores, and adorable at Christmas time!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"Great when it's a nice day outside, the hecklers in the booths are a bit annoying I don't remember them always being there.

Nice store selection."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Big outdoor mall. Extends all the way to State street. Very clean and dog friendly. Great area to take a walk and people watch.

Reminded me a little of the Paseo in Pasadena."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"This outdoor shopping center is super convenient. It would be great as a stand alone, but it's even better being that it's surrounded by other retailers. The beach being walking distance is a huge plus as well. Literally everything you could want to shop for is here."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Beautiful outdoor mall in Santa Barbara.
My needing to go to every mall days are long over, but I do always check out the shopping in the area.
This would be one of the nicest places to go spend money in the area.You feel like in another world, flowers everywhere, it smells great, life just slows down a bit.
Great stores, Nordstrom, Saks, Kitson, worth a stop if you are in the area."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"A really nice shopping plaza in downtown Santa Barbara that has my favorite store Lululemon. Outdoors, fresh air, and a great mixture of shops and places to eat. Really clean and nice restrooms upstairs that even have lotion and tissue dispensers. And floor to ceiling tiling between stalls and full length doors.  That's right, I review restrooms."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,Paseo Nuevo has stepped in up since I lived in SB. Feels like there are much more selection in stores and more upkept compared to a few years ago.  The Macys here is small and the selection in each department is limited but I still managed to buy two pairs of heels.  This is a cool outdoor mall with the traditional Spanish mission feel that sb is known for. For some casual shopping and walking around this is a great place to spend some time while you are on State St.
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Did I mention that I like Santa Barbara? Crazy... because it was a place I never thought I would.... but then again, I am totally like that. I always think something in my head and then change my mind about it...when I actually experience it... so yeah. Typical me.

Anyway, State street is adorable. It has old fashioned charm with tons of stores and restaurants. I definitely need to go back and recheck it out another day... 

Other than that, even at night, it feels like a very safe area. There are always police around, which isn't a bad thing."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Talk about a pretty outdoor mall.  Fountains, trees, flowers, very Spanish architecture......lovely place.  It's on State Street, but you really don't feel it.  Some great stores here.........Nordstrom, Saks 5th Avenue, Macy's are the anchors.  So Good, the costume jewelry store that has NO air conditioning, is here, amongst other stores.  I like their Victoria's Secret store here better than most.  There is a really cool candy/cupcake place (called WhoDelicious) that reminds me so much of something on Main Street in Disneyland...between the decor and the music they play, it's like being at Disneyland.  I think they have cupcake parties there........you decorate your own.  Fun idea.  Parking here, a challenge....parking structure that fills up instantly.  It can get pretty humid on the hotter days."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"Nice shopping mall in the heart of SB right on state street.  Nothing really impressive about it though, has everything everyother mall has, but is outside."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"What a beautiful use of this space. I love how many of the old buildings have been preserved. I shopped at the Macy's, Teavana, Starbucks and Pinkberry. Probably my least favorite Starbucks in some time."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"The atmosphere of this shopping center is very relaxing. I really like the Spanish style architecture. This center was built in 1990 but looks like it was built in 1776 because of the architecture. Macy's, Nordstrom, Barnes and Noble and 60 other shops anchor this lovely mall. You will find whatever you want our need in this outdoor mall. This mall also has a Juicy Culture store as well as Sure La Table. I often drive 75 miles to shop here. This center has the Santa Barbara flavor to it and you escape Los Angeles style rudeness and crowds."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,Lots of fun shops. Love to walk through here on the holidays. They have a  big Christmas tree in the small square and carolers.
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"Honestly I expected more from this outdoor mall, knowing it was on the most busiest street in santa barbara... The look of this outdoor mall is nice, but the selection they have here isn't the best.. I expected ALOT more. They don't really have that much selection, they have the regular stuff; a&f, ae, express, etc. But they didn't have anything exstravagant, which sucked. The whole outdoor mall feel was really nice and too bad we came on a day that wasn't that hot... I love the mexcian feeling the mall gives with all the mission-esque buildings made everything a whole different experience... I give this place 3 stars because I didn't see anything here that I don't have back in S.F."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"My go-to for parking. Free for the first 75 minutes, and $1.50 per hour afterwards. Depending on which section you're in, they have machines to pay before you return to your car, or a human-operated fee collector when you leave. Easy walking distance to plenty of shops and restaurants, and also the beach."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"this review is SOLELY for BP/brass plum nordstrom.
""T"" told me about her experience (im doing this review on her behalf as she doesnt have a yelp account), and i thought future yelpers should be warned before they visit this particular location.
this is not a ""rant""..this is a ""why you should find another nordstrom to shop at"" and please keep in mind ""T"" is a nordstrom visa holder and a regular at her local nordstrom.
could this place be given a NO STARS award, it should be granted. its hard to rate customer service when you arent given any. 
heres how the experience went down:
""T"" is walking around with at least $100 worth of clothes, trying to find a sales girl to start a room for her. sales girl #1 ignores her; ""T"" figures maybe the girl didnt see her standing there. ""T"" goes straight to the dressing rooms, hoping to come across another girl. no such luck, so she walks out. but, tadah! heres sales girl #2..who sees ""T"" standing there with a pile of clothes. not only does sales girl #2 NOT ask ""T"" if she needs any assistance, but she actually glances at her and walks away. so ""T"" figures forget it and puts the clothes away.
well, heres where the NO STARS comes in.
sales girls #1 and #2 are now at the register, chatting up some girls who are purchasing their items. ""if you need anything else, let us know"" ..smilesmilesmile.. ""oh, thank you so much"".. blahblah*freakingblah.
now, why in the world would ""T"" receive such horrible treatment while the other customers received the kind of service nordstrom is known for?
you be the judge-heres the only thing that made ""T"" different from the other customers and sales people.  ""T"" happens to be asian. sales girls #1 and #2? caucasian. the customers in line? well, they happen to be caucasian too.
kinda makes you wonder, doesnt it?
on a side note: the in-store customer service department was notified of ""T""s experience (both verbally and written) and they seemed appalled at the actions of the sales girls. and as you know, nordstrom tends to respond to customer feedback..however, ""T"" has yet to hear from them."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"I went in to look at the sales and was carrying a box of Nine West heels (from Macy's). I received them as a Christmas present, however they were too big. I had gone to Macy's to return them but they didn't have my size. I arrived to Nine West looking at their current sales, and both of the cashiers saw the box and asked if I was going to return them. I explained the situation, and told them how my Macy's didn't have my size and there weren't any available at the Ventura or Camarillo store. The cashier Dc then said she could order them online for me (at a cheaper price too) and asked if I'd like to try the size I wanted -same style, different material. I said yes, of course and after I tried them she ordered them for me and told me it would be free shipping. She was so attentive and nice, so glad she helped me."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Those priorities are convenience, consistency, and character. Good place to do some shopping. Several restaurants also make up a nice variety."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"4.5 Stars
Even though I saw a shirtless guy at Abercrombie, someone barged into my dressing room at the Gap, couldn't buy a bracelet at Pandora cuz they were too expensive, had to sit at a dirty table in the Coffee Bean; I guess you could say my Black Friday shopping morning was fun. Thanks Paseo Nuevo!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,This place is HUGE!!! the way it's set up is very interesting. Their are stores on the street as your driving its like a drive thru mall kinda. Then you have some stores inside a center like arena. It takes like 3-4 days to go through the whole mall so get ready to shop! all kind of stores for all types of people. Minutes away from the beach. Probably one of the best shopping areas I've ever went to.
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"The noticeably high number of panhandlers/homeless contrasting with the overpriced merchandise (no doubt due to the inflated rent) made my excursion to the outdoor mall a bit strange.    This shopping center is very upscale, complete with a very fancy Nordtrom's and many big name stores yet the city can't seem to deal with the vagrants.  I'm sure there are shelters where they can go for food/warmth but instead they prefer cash. I'm sure tourists would like to enjoy themselves but there were *groups* of homeless elderly and teens on every corner and even hanging out at the fountains in the shopping area.  They have a right to sit anywhere but visitors probably are bothered by the constant requests for change.

Most stores had attentive clerks but some of them were a bit annoying.  I went into one and 3 different young clerks asked me if I wanted help.  In the end it was just better for me to window shop and peak inside only if I think something was reasonably priced."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Love this shopping center. Every time I visit SB I usually stop by here. Great stores and beautiful architecture and landscaping. My only complaint is parking is a pain, especially if you want free parking haha but that is expected. You can find free parking if you are lucky or you will have to walk a far distance. Great shopping mall though!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"Great little outdoor shopping center. After a day of shopping you can stay there at the great food places located inside Paseo. ""Pickles and Swiss"" and ""Eureka Burger"" are my favorite. Paseo is also located in an awesome location. The beach is only a couple miles down State Street and all down State Street there are bars and restaurants. If you plan on spending a weekend in Santa Barbara, I recommend walking through Paseo Nuevo."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"I think everyone got so excited about their purchases that they forgot to mention the homeless people EVERYWHERE!!! And the pee smell EVERYWHERE!!! I come from Northern CA and have never been to any mall in San Francisco, San Jose, Tri Valley or over a dozen others that ever were so GROSS and NASTY. Dog Poo on the ground so watch your step! The shops are not so fantastic - mostly the same kind you find in any indoor mall. You could do better in ANY indoor mall and feel a whole lot safer. I forgot to mention... The homeless people tend to travel in packs of 3-5. Not exactly what a girl wants to see, esp as it's getting dark. If you're a tourist and walk from Sterns Warf or the beach up State Street, keep in mind you will pass all these people, as you walk under the freeway in the tunnel. They are on every block and they take up all the benches. Try to Google Maps Street View the area for a better picture. In the daytime, you will be safe because so many other people are out and about, but it's still very nasty and stinky. Not at all a pleasant experience. What a girl will sacrifice to go shopping. haha..."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,negative,"I worked at this mall when it opened in the early 1990's, not much has changed.

The selection is just okay but it's proximity to the downtown shopping district makes it a great place to park.

It is an outdoor mall so it isn't a great place to escape the rain."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"A very nice outdoor shopping complex with a decent amount of stores. The anchor stores here are Macy's and Nordstrom. 

I'll definitely be back the next time I visit this town!"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"The warm sun shining down on my skin. The wind blowing through my hair.

When I first moved here, I wasn't accustomed to the beauty and fresh air that an outdoor mall..ehm..shopping center allows. 

I have come to appreciate how pleasant it is to walk around in the open spaces in and out of stores. Shopping is a much better experience here than in indoor malls, which many of us are probably very familiar with.

Walk up and down State St. 
Paseo Nuevo is in a great location somewhere in the middle-ish of it all. When you get tired of brand names, Macy's, Nordstrom, etc., there are other independent stores along the street and in cross streets. Or you can just go and eat something."
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,"I really like this mall.
amazing vibes , sun , palm tree, good energy!! 
a lot of
good stores and nice people 
love it !"
8-ZExybRuyyXZf6aESgc3g,Paseo Nuevo Shopping Center,American,positive,This is really nice outdoor mall. We came here for Christmas shopping and bought the biggest part of presents for my friends and family. Also this is great place to eat: we have American dinner. A cup of coffee helped us to keep warm because we spend about one hours just walking around this place. Looks like I am felling in love with Santa Barbara!
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Went for Happy Hour with co-workers. The location makes this place a hidden little gem as its tucked away a bit but draws just the right amount of people for a Tuesday night. Cozy ambiance as its not too big and is great location to have nice conversation. A water fountain provided a nice back drop to the setting.

The beer they had on tap hosted a good mix with choices of good IPAs and local beers. I had their ""Boo Koo"" IPA that was freshly tapped and Telegraph's sour wheat offering.

We shared a charcuterie board with some good and unique options that aren't always your standard fare, like a pickled Brussel sprout (from a local Pickleworks) and Spanish chorizo. 

This is a great spot to grab an app, glass of wine, and/or a beer with a small group of friends that provided excellent, courteous, and unpretentious service. 

For non-Santa Barbarians: Keep in mind that Anacapa and surrounding some surrounding streets are one-way and park at City Parking Lot 10 if you can't find street parking."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Great place, such a nice enviroment! They got some live music! Everything was perfect, the beer, the wine, the food.. Thanks Gabi and Sean (the owners) for such a nice experience."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,Perfect pre dinner wine and tapas!  Great ambiance and service. The staff was very friendly.  The chef even came out to say hello. Awesome place!  Great music and wine. We will definitely make a return trip!
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Visiting from San Luis Obispo for the evening, and found Villa with 5 stars on Yelp. Their reputation is well earned, with the owner Sean dropping awesome wine knowledge and helping us choose a great glass of wine, without being stingy about letting us taste 2-3 different wines before choosing. You can tell he actually cares about customers getting a good glass of wine. The food was also excellent; we had the bruschetta, which was awesome, and then the Roma panini, which was the best panini I've had in a long time. We'll be back on our next trip to SB."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"We found Villa Wine Bar and Kitchen through Yelp, so thank you, Yelpers!  What a great spot just off of the main drag through SB.  We met both the chef and Sean, the owner, who was very knowledgeable yet not pretentious about wine.  He had a nice selection of many local wines and different varietals, as well as some great beer selections on tap.  The wine bar has a nice tiled fountain inside which gave a soothing sound as we sipped wine.  The chef here is sending out of the kitchen the perfect food to complement the drink...paninis with prosciutto, sun dried tomato jam and mozzarella, a trio of dips with ciabatta bread, and a very nice meat and cheese board.  This was all at lunchtime, which was not crowded and gave us a chance to talk to Sean and learn more about the wines we were enjoying.  A very nice time was had, and we wish Villa all the success in the world!"
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"My boyfriend took me here for lunch on my birthday last week. We knew it was brand-new and run by the owners of a local wine shop that we love. The location was perfect for us as we were doing some shopping downtown. Generous parking available using the city lot located right across the street. The ambience of the place was perfect: Open and airy with a beautifully-tiled water fountain placed right in the dining area. Very nicely decorated with an Italian feel. The owner (Sean) was very attentive and quite knowledgeable about wines, which helped us to select a delicious chilled Rose to go with our lunch. We shared one of their Panini sandwiches (I forget which one Sean recommended for us) as well as the INCREDIBLE Isabella salad. All the ingredients were of high-quality and extremely fresh. The dressing on the salad was perfect as well. I know they are just starting out but they seem to have nailed-it already, as far as food/wine goes. We will definitely be returning as soon as possible."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,Stopped by on our way through Santa Barbara. What a gem. Paninis were fantastic and great selection of beers and wines.
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"The ambiance is casual and chic! Many options for great wine and the food is fresh and delicious plus the prices are reasonable. And they have unique and hard-to-find craft beer selection. It's located in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara with easy access to parking and other establishments. One of the hidden Gem is their special dinner events. You can find out about those if you are in their e-mail list or follow Villa on social media. We went to a 5-course dinner with Booker wine and the wine maker was there and a few bottles that are already sold out. The food surpassed my expectation. It was fresh, incredible menu selection that paired well with Booker Wines."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"This place is incredible. The name doesn't signal the unbelievable beer selection which they rotate weekly. Best curated beer on tap I've tasted in a long time. Bar tenders are very knowledgeable and friendly. 

Delicious cheese plates and paninis to keep the drafts company. Highly recommend this spot, will definitely be back."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,Impresive beer and wine seleciton...many fun time to be had by all
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Love everything about this spot! We hosted our engagement party on Aug. 27 at Villa and it was perfect. Gabi the owner was wonderful to work with and the set up was great! She selected some amazing wines for our party and our guests couldn't stop raving about the space, what wines and the hospitality!!! Thank you!!! Can't wait to get back in soon."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,Awesome experience last night after a not so great experience with a different establishment. We were immediately greeted by one of the bartenders. Found a spot at the bar. Tasted a couple of really nice wines before we settled on a delicious Syrah. Awesome live music. Nice low key vibe. Ally our bartender was very attentive and sweet and friendly. We want to go back and try the food!
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,negative,"Wines and paninis/tapas are very good. But they need to work on their appearance: nobody at the counter for 5 minutes, a sweaty biker crashing his bike into the entrance and (as a buddy) distracting the waitress, no clients at all (apart from us) for two hours, waitress texting on her phone constantly... Turns out there was a happy hour still on when I walked in, for 10-15 minutes, and I wasn't told... Could someone save this place please?"
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"This spot has become one of my go-to happy hour spots.  Sean and Gabie and their staff are as friendly and helpful as you could ever hope for.  Great ambiance, prices, and selection."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,Fantastic selection of beer and wine. Great service and ambience. A fun place overall to hangout with friends.
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Excellent addition to the downtown SB beer and wine scene. Great selection of  wines from all over and an absolutely great beer selection on tap and in bottles. Only 8 taps but  man some amazing stuff you just don't see most places. Sean and Gabby are the greatest people and they really know their stuff, they've done a great job here and we love it  The decor is great too and right across the street from a ton of parking. My new favorite spot in SB :-)"
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Unbelievable! Great, great,great people! Amazing selection of wine and brews with an incredible food selection. We shared the charcuterie plate which had local cheese and candied nuts. 

I think this is a hidden gem of Santa Barbara. We have been for many nights including Brazilian jazz and eclectic rocker. We enjoy Sean and Gabby Bd the chef. So much good food and great drinks.

Come here and enjoy the vibe!"
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Just finished eating at Villa Wine Bar, had the bruschetta and Siena Panini. Both taste amazing. The portions are ample and the presentation is great. My wife and I have dined at wine bars and craft breweries many times and the food here is the best. Allie was friendly and informative regarding the beers and wines as well as the local scene. We will be back."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Stopped by after passing by many times over the past year and thinking 'we must go there'. Now wondering why it took us so long. This place is great - it has a fantastic selection of wines for all tastes and also has a good selection of beers on tap. The decor inside is high end and feels like it will last a life time - white granite and dark woods. It's classy.
For food we ordered the charcuterie plate - when it came out we thought the waiter got the wrong table, as this was a feast. I think there were 5 or 6 different cheeses, different breads, a selection of tasty meats and fresh grapes, apricots and nuts. It's simply the best charcuterie plate I've seen here in California. The bar man, Sean, joked soon we will make it much smaller and charge twice the price! Whilst funny, I'm saying don't do that man!!!  I'm going to tell all my friends that they need to go here after work, have some great wine and beer, and get the charcuterie plate. 
We had a wonderful experience and talking with Sean was a pleasure."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Love this spot. Great atmosphere, friendly people and a rare selection of beers on tap."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,This place is amazing! Best happy hour in town! Everyone needs to check it out! My favorite is the Bruschetta!!!
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,This place is wonderful! Great for a light dinner and good glass of beer or wine. Owners know their wines and the selection is superb.  The ambiance is great and there is a working fountain inside. Great place to chillax.
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Great place, great service. Owners are excellent. My sister had her wedding reception here, it was wonderful. Very impressed with the turn out. Thank you Gabriella!"
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"I have been buying wine at Vino Divino for years a very small shop, yet rare wines. I would stop by at times to buy wine, but not often. over the years I started to go by more often, just to find out they were great. guess what, just found out, they own Villa Wine Bar and Kitchen. Fine wine and craft beer, small production, just up my alley. ok, its a small world."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Simply ahhhhh-mazing! Gabi, Sean and Allie are the best! Thank you for making our recent wedding rehearsal dinner fantastic! The food, wine, craft beer and service, accompanied by a great attitude from Gabi made this an awesome experience. I cannot wait to come back up to SB to visit you! This wine  bar has the charm of a cafe and is sophisticated but not pretentious! Try it- you will love it! Thank you again!!!"
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"I think it was a quiet night when I went in here, a Wednesday right after Labor Day Weekend. We ordered some happy hour wines and apps and everything was great. We had just gotten to Santa Barbara for the first time and our waitress, Allie, hooked us up! She gave us recommendations of all the best things to do and the list really was awesome. I think this place is going to do great and is a hidden gem for sure."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,Great ambience and service. Not from area and found this place. Will definitely come again and I highly recommend it.
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"We used Villa wine bar to cater my baby shower. The whole experience was fabulous from start to finish. Communicating with Gabriella was easy, even my friend who took over planning mentioned how nice she is. The food was fresh and delicious. I am looking forward to being able to drink some wine and dining in person!"
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,Perfect spot for a drink with colleagues and friends. Happy hour wines are very good. Walking distance to businesses in downtown. Beautiful decor and friendly staff. Love it!!
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,negative,"Staff and service were terrific!! However, when it's 96 degrees and humid outside the lack of a fan with no A/C mad it tough on everyone. I would definitely go back on a cooler day or if they get more air moving thru the place!"
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Came in here on a rainy  early Friday afternoon with my boys. Stone stout was fantastic like a meal in itself. Paninnis were delicious. This is our absolute new Santa Barbara favorite. You have to go if you love tapas, craft beer  and the best California wines."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"I'm simple. So is Villa. Simple goodness. Warm and inviting, and good service. The Avocado Bruschetta was really good, but could have used more of the good stuff -- avocado. The panini wasn't flattened but had good flavor, with generous portions of amazing bread. The meal greeted me with a spinach salad, which I received warmly."
R93mEcQ1pjq7q3LzShi3ow,"Villa Craft Beer, Wine & Kitchen",American,positive,"Delicious small plates, good prices, lovely service. Can't wait to go back"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I come here every week and I'm eureka obsessed. The staff is awesome, the food is awesome, and my friends can't go too long without it. Thank you for the truffle fries  Simply iconic! Also for being consistently amazing"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"We went for brunch, as we were seated I can hear the hostess starting talking about 'dogs eating their own shit' we were seated right next to where she was standing. I was appalled by what I was hearing in a restaurant let alone by the hostess."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I've come here in the past and those times were fine, nothing too amazing or anything. I went there this time expecting the same kind of experience but in the end was heavily disappointed. Hostess brought us to our tables (outside in the corner, kinda hidden) but our waitress didn't come out to greet us at all. In fact we had to go inquire about getting some service so we could order. We were seated for at least 15 minutes before we got waters. The restaurant wasn't even that busy for how long we were waiting for. I got the cowboy bacon burger expecting a treat but really it wasn't worth the calories and I thought I could easily make a better burger at home with more flavor. I think it'll be a while before I go back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I'm still going and so should you

Getting in just under the Happy Hour bell (6pm) of Friday, Eureka was standing room only. It was not long before we three secured seats at the bar. Excellent beers all around as I started with the Racer 5, Osso Buco Riblets, Corn Dog Pops and 2x Pulled Pork Sliders. All of which I highly recommend. The Riblets are the best on the HH menu but you're in luck, they're available at all hours. 

Good music does not drown out the conversations and the bar TVs are all on sports. Don't come if you want to hear what's on but thew will flip on the Closed Captioning. Speaking of conversations, bring on the big parties and catch up. Two groups of 10+ showed up and loked to have a great time. Good to know for my next adventure diner.

Introduced an out of town guest to the Bourbon menu and he, being a connoisseur, was impressed. Me? I'm lost and sticking with the taps. I did sample two of his and they were quite good but don't take my word for it.

Having spent 4 hours enjoying pours, we were hungry again. Time for burgers! As I'm a huge fan, the Jalapeno and Egg was delicious subbing for rings. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is the size of the rings. You get 4, massive rungs and after a burger and beer, I can only put away 2. Sad really because they are good.

All this talk is making me hungry. Looks like I may need to get off he couch and head down. Good thing it's almost 2. HAPPY HOUR!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I'm a fan of this place, not the best burger I've ever had but the Cowboy burger is definitely one of the best you can get in town. It's always really busy so make sure you get there early to reserve a table!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Food is damn good, I ordered the fig burger with sweet potato fries and a beer, tastes pretty much amazing. however it took them about 20 minutes to get me a beer, and they messed up my friends order. The staff is nice enough, but when I told them that they forgot a beer the blame was set on us. sure the music is just a bit loud but honestly not a huge fan of the waiting staff. 

overall ok experience. not going to recommend it based on the waitresses but the food is pretty prime. 

trying to get the waitress over at all is a hardship, we did sit in a corner booth which may be the reason for the slow service but honestly not too stoked...maybe don't offer that booth if you're going to ignore it?


***went back recently (7/22) and staff was slightly better. not as upsetting as the first time"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Quick service, nice staff, nice ambience. They have weekend $5.all day bloody marys & mimosas. good Happy Hour Menu 2pm-6pm
Bison burger, B.Marrow burger, Blue cheese burger where all good! 

I paid $26.43 for a bison burger w/side of fries, mac&cheese & ice tea. Good"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I was sitting there, enjoying my tortilla burger, and thought we could use one in Turlock.  Then I realized it was the same as The Dust Bowl, which is awesome.  Great stop just off State Street."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This place is awesome. The wife and I were in town for our anniversary. We randomly came upon Eureka. The menu is great, we kept commenting on how many items we wanted to try (I think we will be back before we leave town). The food was so yummy. Great outdoor seating (especially if you like people watching Haha). John, think he is one of the cooks, checked on us multiple times and brought my wife some extra salad after he noticed the bowl wasnt very full of lettus. Great service, great food."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love going to this place! Especially during happy hour! But tonight I didn't and still was just as pleased... 
Service: Marshall is amazing!! He was on top of everything. Including extra ranch, which no one has enough of!
Atmosphere: inviting! The crowd was all in a good mood. Didn't see one unhappy person. It was a crowd that I would have dessert if I had room. 
Food: so delicious! I had the chicken sliders and they were so good. Started with Brussels sprouts and mac 'n' cheese balls. So dang good. 
Drinks: they have local brews on draft so can't pass one of those up! Cheers & enjoy! 
Will totally recommend this to my friends to come!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Their food is not good enough to make up for their mediocre service. Great atmosphere, but honestly I thought their food was average. They're a bit expensive, they're always busy, and the service wasn't overwhelmingly good. Also, it was a bit concerning because we were sitting next to a couple who had to send their burger back twice because it was still bleeding despite the well done request (oh, and by the way, the tables are so dang close you can easily hear your dining neighbor's entire conversation.) 

They do have a decent amount of beers, and their menu choices are unique, so if you're looking for a cool restaurant for you and your buddies to meet up after work, this should do the trick.

I'm not saying this is a bad place to go, just perhaps try getting a reservation/ going during happy hour."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Fun place to visit.  We had great service and the food was really fresh and full of flavor.  We had burgers and salad and they were really good.  Homemade ketchup for your fries and you have to try their lemonade!! Great place to dine.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka is definitely the only restaurant of its kind in Santa Barbara. Fun, upbeat atmosphere. At least 10 different burgers on the menu, I've tried a few different ones and they've all been really good. Great beer selection too. Only complaint is that the service is usually really slow."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Fig burger is amazing and has a great kid menu (no high chair though).
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Usually love this place but our last visit was disappointing. Seems they forgot about us, as the host looked sort of panicked and sat us immediately. 

Waiter was less then enthusiastic and only checked in with us to tell us he was leaving for break.... Had to approach the manager to ask for the check after no one ever followed up with us. 

On the bright side, Hoppy Poppy is still slightly less then how much Fig Mtn sells it for.."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Delicious, cheap, happy hour 2-6pm, beer 4$, amazing tacos 8$, recommended, dog friendly"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The food is good, but don't expect good service. There always seems to be a wait, but there are plenty of tables. Once you sit down you never know what kind of service you are going to get. During my last visit, we had to ask our server for water three times. Each time she asked, she never brought us water and would ask us again if we needed anything. Go figure. Although the food came out in a normal time frame, everything else took forever like getting someone to take our order and to get our bill. Again the burgers and salads are good, but if you don't care about service then check it out."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"A group of 25-30 of our company's (Citrix Online) Christmas party came in for an ""after party"" tonight. The staff was friendly & quick to set us up in the bar area while we patiently waited for tables to clear up.
The hostesses are cute (FYI for the guys), and super sweet. Our server, Brooks (sp?) has been incredibly attentive to all of us (over half are tipsy) and even going out of his way to create separate checks for us. Pretty impressive for one server to meet the demands of such a happy & loud group with A SMILE. 
We ordered anywhere from apps like Chicken Nachos to salads like their Watermelon [Salad] to entrees like the King Crab Cake Sliders. The bar kept up with the various drinks we ordered, too.
As everyone is paying & calling cabs, I see empty plates, big smiles and hear how great their after party meal was here at Eureka!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka is a great place to stop in for a casual lunch or dinner when you're shopping in downtown Santa Barbara. I've been here multiple times and have always had good experiences.

The burgers are juicy, and can be ""naked"" served over a bed of arugula. They always have new fun beers to try, and they offer flights so you can sample multiple beers. The Grilled Shrimp Salad is one of my favorite things on the menu.

By far the best thing at Eureka though is the Glazed Brussel Sprouts. I might even say they're the best I've ever had. I get them every time I come here. The orange chili glaze that they put on them makes them to die for. Can't say enough good things about them, a must try!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Love this place! They have good drinks but sometimes it can get packed and a little bit of a wait!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"If you are changing extra fkr the onion rings make sure you serve them warm or hot and make sure there are more than four. 

The wings lacked BBQ flavor and were similar to Costco frozen wings. Not bad but not 9.00 wings. 

The Cowboy BBQ burger was consistent as it lacked a BBQ flavor. It did come with more onion strings than the upgraded onion rings. 

Not worth it. Wont last. Could walk here but will pay the gas and drive past to Padaro Beach Grill."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Done! Three strikes and you're out. First time there was when they were just open and they forgot my husbands entree entirely. Second time, I got sick. Tonight, I gave it one last shot, and waited just under an hour for a table to be disappointed once again. I wouldn't recommend to friends. If you want a good burger try American Ale, way better!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,love eureka!! our server Jordan was super friendly and adorable! will definitely be back soon!!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Stopped here for late lunch after getting into SB with a group of four.  It seemed very busy in the area and parking on the street or garages nearby can be a bit of a challenge.  They are located right on State St. at the Paseo Nuevo outdoor mall area which is a iconic location.  It seems like you can't go wrong with this place, they have a sweet indoor/outdoor restaurant setup that is perfect for the warm SB weather.  I've never heard of this place but it's supposedly a popular chain down here in so-cal. 

We came in and asked for a table did not have to wait too long to be seated, which was a big plus when its past lunch time and you're hungry. They seemed to have people coming in constantly.  Our server was prompt but seemed to take a long while to get water to our table.  A friend in our group was complaining about how long it took cause they were dying of thirst.  I decided to try the Fresno Fig Burger with goat cheese which sounded delicious, I don't often see a ""Fig"" burger on many menus. I opted for the side salad instead of fries.  At $12 I was expecting something huge but the portion was a tad smaller than I thought. 

Everyone else seemed to order some type of burger or something like that.  The food did not take too long to come out and I was delicious. Everyone enjoyed theirs but mentioned the small portion after we were done eating.  I'd rather have a smaller portion is the quality of the burger is better than a bigger one that would over stuff me., LOL.  Our server split the check for us after someone requested it.  This place also advertises a great happy hour deal that I'm sure draws plenty of patrons during the week.  I'd recommend checking out a Eureka at any one of their so-cal locations, although apparently they also have one in Berkeley and Bakersfield!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Can't beat the cute waitresses, the Jalapeno Egg burger and the $3 Hoppy Poppy IPA. Also a great spot to watch football, they have all the games on, on mute.. so you can still talk to your friends without the game drowning out the conversation."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Had such a blast with the BEST bartender Zach! Thank you for making me and my boyfriend's 4 year anniversary a memorable  experience! I enjoyed your humour, service and hospitality! We will definitely be back asking for you the next time we visit!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Loved this chain usually but disappointed with my experience just now.  Always get the Bison burger but it didn't come with the awesome bacon infused pepper sauce. Just be ring sautéed peppers and red onion rings.  Waitress got my order half right. I said no cheese,  I got cheese on burger and on the salad.  I got charged for a side salad even though all of wanted was to switch from FF to tossed sakes that's free.  Gal at front desk was new .  Sweet and apologetic but shouldn't have bee. Put up front if she didn't knew e the menu and the questions to ask.  Train your staff and be consistent with the offerings stated in the menu."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The food was really good. However, we ordered take out. We were staying in a Hotel. Things you need if you're going to eat : forks, condiments. For the salad we ordered, no utensils. For the corn dogs, no mustard. Even though we SPECIFICALLY asked for it. 

The basic standards were not met."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Visited Santa Barbara for my 21st bday and came here for lunch

Whew, this place was packed and loud. After going there, I totally understand why.

Food was good and you can make your burgers healthy by getting turkey patties and ordering your burger ""naked"", which I loved. Sweet potato fries were to DIE for. The best part was that after substituting just about everything in my meal, the waitress was still super friendly and didn't mind at all.

You have to order beer here. My friends and I tried the beer sampler and had a great time trying all of the different local beers. I'd definitely recommend getting the sampler so you can try everything. It was a perfect amount of beer for lunch too. 

Loved this place. Great place to hang out with a group of friends and its family friendly too. & the beer was awesome....I'll definitely be back next time I'm in SB"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I love the gourmet burgers and diverse selection of craft beers and whiskey that allow for endless pairing combinations.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,i was skeptic at first cause it was really busy but there fast about getting u situated and served great food and service will be back definitely
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Freaking delicious!!!!!! Found this place just on a whim and so glad we did!!!!!! 

Service wasn't great, but it wasn't awful either. Our server just seemed a little overwhelmed - maybe someone called in sick? 

They had live music which was really nice - we sat on the patio though because inside was a little loud (personal taste). 

Will defiantly be back!!!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I had a nice dining experience here at eureka!. The burgers are pretty good, just had the jalapeño egg burger, fantastic! Great place for a night out"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"3 stars for me.. party of 2.  We waited 30-45mins like everyone else. Then a party of 4 came in, there was outside seating available only so they took iy. Then the lady from their party complained about the sun outside and was rushed inside. Skipping us completely and others on the wait list. I wasn't happy! Someone waiting in line asking why the other party got seated before us all and the host said that their party was bigger than ours. Horrible.   After waiting for about 15mins more we got seated. I spoke to Lamar the manager about this and he took care of it. He hooked us up with a free appetizer of Nacho Average Nachos. It was tasty. . Overall ok. Lots of beer and alcohol selection.. that's a plus."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I have wanted to try this place since it opened as I am always searching for new ""Burger"" places that are a little on the gourmet side.  I wasnt too concerned about the price, as more of the quality.

My wife had the regular burger with fries and I had the Cowboy with onion rings.  We ordered lemonade to wash it all down and while being hot, I sucked mine down rather quickly.  Waitress walked by 5 times and several of those, as she walked by, she looked at the table and i was in hopes of getting a refill. NOPE.  I had to ask another server for a refill which she quickly brought.

Food arrived and looked appetizing, and was ready to dig in.  3 onions rings where the batter which would literally fall apart when you took a bite.  the spicy ranch cup was only about 1"" round to dip a 3"" onion ring, lame.

Burger was decent but lacked seasoning and hardly any ""maybe a dollop"" of BBQ sauce when this is a ""Cowboy"" burger, nothing else but meat, cheese, onion straws and some bacon, rather dry and flavorless.  Wife couldnt even eat her burger as tasted like eating air.  Fries tasted old and like they had freezer burn.

On the other hand, decor was nice, good selection of beer and whiskey and manager did a lot of walking around not checking on the guests to see if ""everything"" was ok.

First and last time, was really hoping for a new spot to eat downtown.  I'm not a food, but if I am going to spend $30 for two burgers and a fountain drink, I expect more.  Chubbies is less than half the price and twice as good."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Ok I'm partial to Bourbon selections so this place already gets high ratings. But the cauliflower bites and street tacos were a perfect compilment.  Top it off with that ridiculous bourbon cake and we were set. Service is good considering they are always busy.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Food and drinks are good here.  Service is not so great, which I dock a star for.  As for checking in,  they take down your number and text you.   That is very convenient so you can walk around the mall a bit while waiting.  There are NO RESERVATIONS. 

The burgers are delicious.   My fav is the Napa burger, naked (no buns), and without cheese.  I have added the picture.  I love the spread.  As of today (Feb 18, 2017) the burger isn't on the menu anymore but you can still order it.   It charges as the Napa chicken at $12,  but I get medium rare beef instead.  I've had the following sides: fries,  sweet potato fries, and coleslaw.  The sweet potato fries come with honey!  The coleslaw comes spicy with peppers in it.   I suggest you ask for no peppers because it tastes better that way. 

They have tons of beers and whiskeys.   I'm a fan of their Old Fashioned as well as the Four Roses bourbon. 

Happy hour is 2-6pm and after 9pm everyday!  There are a few drinks and appetizers on there.   I don't care much for it because I just want the burgers and drinks not on the HH menu. 

Service here is pretty poor.   They get so busy on the weekends and seem understaffed.  Almost every time,  we wait forever for food, water,  and even the check.   What's worst is that we always go in a large group and put our credit card amounts on the back of the receipt.  Hence,  it takes even longer to get the credit cards through."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I swear I had lost my pants for good this time, and instead of getting kicked out before I could finish my meal Monica offered to look for them, and wouldn't you know they were in the kitchen ( piping hot probably fresh out of the dish washer) who'd a thought?
Thank you  Monica and eureka for having such an attentive staff! And the food was good too! Try the fig burger! 
I did!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great beer, appetizers, waitstaff, happy hour prices, what more could you want?  
Love the chicken and Mahi tacos.  The fries are perfectly crispy, daughter loved the grilled cheese.  Although always busy we get seating within 10 minutes."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"My boyfriend and I ordered delivery from here via SBMenus. I ordered a cheese burger medium. I bit into the burger and it was raw. Like falling apart, disgustingly raw. I ended up taking the hamburger patty out of the bun and MICROWAVING it to cook it more. I'm extremely unhappy with what I received tonight."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Terrible service. I shouldn't have to ask then wait 20 min for things like napkins and silverware. The manager kindly offered a free round of drinks, however I would have preferred good service. Adrian made a valiant effort to correct his predecessors many mistakes.The food was decent so they three stars."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I/we love Eureka. Here's what you need to know. I'm breaking it into 3 categories: Food, Drink, Service. 

FOOD - Delicious. The burgers and overall food size/portions have been downsized since they first opened 6 or 7 years ago. This is probably a good thing. And the prices have gone up. The menu undergoes constant changes, with frequent (yearly?) updates. Top hits: any of the burgers, esp. the bone marrow burger (gluttony), cob salad, truffle fries...for the love of god, order a side of firecracker sauce. Take some home. Bathe in it.

DRINKS - Fantastic selection of draught beers as well as a number of rotating handles. All are worth trying. The Figueroa Mountain Hoppy Poppy is always $4 and is a local favorite...get it. As far as wine goes, they have a decent selection...but on Tuesday, all wine is half off, including bottles. Good idea to go on Tuesday. Oh, and $5 mimosas and bloody mary's on Sunday. 

*Eco-Tip #1- Don't buy Justin Wine, which Eureka has on the menu. Justin recently destroyed/clearcut old growth Oak forests in neighboring San Luis Obispo County. There is a huge ongoing local boycott. It's a bummer Eureka still has them on the menu. 
*Eco-Tip #2- When ordering drinks (waters, cocktails, sodas, etc.), please ask tell you server #NoStrawThankYou. See more on this under 'service' below.

SERVICE - Here's where it gets funky. In general, service is fine, and as you'd expect at any similar restaurant. It seems that over the years, though, service has degraded. There is a huge turnover in staff, constantly. Right when you get to know your servers after a few months, they leave. I suppose this is normal being that SB is a college town with lots of people moving back and forth. 

The really strange part is this: the slower the day (# of people in the restaurant), the longer it will take you to get served, especially if you sit outside. I've waited (not kidding) 55 minutes on a very slow day to get served. To their credit, they ended up comping my meal on that occasion. But on many other occasions, I've waited 20 minutes to be served a beer, which is unacceptable. Also, if you choose to sit in one of the few inside booths, you will be all but ignored, especially on busy days. Don't ask me why. So, the service here is hit and miss...you're pretty much better off going in on a busy day, ironically. 

Finally, me and my friends have this thing where we always say #NoStrawThankYou whenever we go out. This because there's very little need to use a single-use plastic, except for in rare occasions. As such, we always make this request of our servers at Eureka when ordering water or other drinks. Despite the request, straws will arrive in our drinks 50% of the time. And once it's in there, you can't 'send it back,' resulting in unnecessary plastic pollution/waste. We've actually started a collection of all the straws that Eureka staff has brought us after we asked them not to...you'll be amazed. Seems like a simple request...not sure why it's so difficult. Pictures of our straw pile will be posted here soon. 

SUMMARY - This place is great. I was there for their opening night which featured reggae artist Pato Banton. My employees and I eat there probably once per week...and have brought hundreds of friends over the years and have purchased hundreds of burgers and beers...maybe thousands. In fact, as committed as we are to this place, and I'm sure others are too, you'd think they'd start a 'frequent flyers club' or something (hint hint). But despite the great food, cool vibe, great music, multiple TVs (operating on mute), Eureka could step it up a notch on customer service and how it treats or acknowledges repeat customers. 

My friends and I will be back again and again, but we'll never stop joking about the slow service on slow days or the straw issue mentioned above until they resolve what seem to be easy fixes.

Don't forget the firecracker sauce!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I wanted to post a review before my next visit in hopes that my experience will be five star instead of four.  Here is the deal Eureka!:  You are awesome!!!  I love you.  I've been there twice and hope to make you my weekly indulgence, but your service does not match the deliciousness of your food!  That's basically it. I love your jalapeño / egg burger and I love the IPA's I've ordered! And of course the sweet potato fries and the baby mini ribs.  But the last time I was there, it took forever to order.  Your bar got my friend's martini completely wrong (the waiter brought out a glass with vodka), the waiter was unfamiliar with your beer selections, and he brought our food out without replacing the flatware another staffer had removed when she cleared our table after we finished with our appetizers.  I don't know if the waiter was inexperienced, or just clumsy.  

I know you are already packing it in with customers, so your manager's lack of motivation may be understandable, but it would be nice if your waitstaff was trained to understand what good service is:  being attentive, and remembering that forks and knives are useful when eating (even a hamburger).  

Friendliness and smiles do not make up for bad service."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Update... I got a message from one of the owners (Robert) who said they would like more information on how to get sustainable seafood locally.  So stay tuned!  I'm looking forward to changing this to a 5 star rating.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We have a new puppy and we're looking for a lunch spot that would allow our Morty. This also was our 1st dinning experience with him so we were a little nervous.We weren't sure how it was going to go, saw the reviews and checked it out. 

Staff was very friendly service was great! They offered out pup water right away. What I liked about the seating was the restaurant is an open concept and the patio is an extension of the inside. So you don't feel like you have to be banished to the patio just bc you brought your pup. To be honest the patio felt like the place to be! 

The ability to bring our pup is what brought us but the food and the service is what will keep us coming back! Our waitress and hostess were amazing. The Napa burger was delihcious, highly recommend. They also have a huge assortment of cocktails, wines and beer. If you like light beers Momma's Yella Little Pils was awesome. Check it out for yourself!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"New years day early dinner.  We got a seat right away, no wait.  A little slow considering it was a holiday.  The staff (hostess, server and support staff) seemed overwhelmed and not really enthusiastic about working that day.  Out table was dirty so I had to get it cleaned twice.  We orders 3 burgers and a mac & cheese side.  The burgers were great but the mac came out cold.  Our server came around every so often but not enough.  My second beer took extra long to come out too.  The food is good but the service from start to finish needs work.  The GM or manager made an effort to pick up the slack of his dismal staff.  MY RATING IS ON THE FOOD, NOT THE SERVICE."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Food was good, service was good, drinks were good. My only issue was that I kept finding blue threads. I found two small ones in my drink and a longer one in my fries. Not sure if they're using a blue towel to dry their dishes or where else they could be coming from. Not a deal breaker for me, might be for someone else."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Had a delish dinner here. Everything was great, food, timing, the service. Amy, our server, was extremely good. She gave great recommendations from drinks to dessert!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"It's pretty noisy and the service is a bit slow, but their food is delicious! 

There's always a bit of a wait and the tables are so close so forget about trying to have a private conversation -- not only will you be able to hear the next tables conversation, but you'll also bump elbows with them. 

When ordering, I highly recommend the truffle cheese fries and their Fresno fig burger. They're my favorite! 

*Side note: they used to have ""steal-the-glass"" nights where you could take a beer glass home if you ordered whatever beer was being featured that day. I'm not too sure if they still do it, but I think that's pretty cool."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Went to Eureka Burger last night as we drove by the restaurant and saw it was packed on a Monday night! unbeknownst to us it was the grand opening, complete with a live reggae band, and great atmosphere.  

We had to wait 20 minutes for a table but no worries as the popular well stocked bar proved ample entertainment with the vast selection of world class beers and whiskey.

When we arrived at our seats our servers (yes we had three people waiting on us, so I never waited more and a minute for a refill or more napkins) were quick to take our orders and bring our food.

I had the Napa Burger and O.M.G. it was the best burger I have ever eaten!! The burger came with a pesto aioli, Havarti, panchetta, and sun dried tomatoes, and wow the meat was juicy and tender.  It was pure heaven, I think the burger ran for about 11.95, but boy was it worth every bite. 

I cant wait to come back later this week to check out one of the other amazing looking burgers on the menu."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Extremely disappointed with the menu changes recently.  We would visit this location regularly for the nachos, and after tonight's visit we are hesitant to come back. The nachos have shrunken to more than half in size, still with very little toppings.  I wish I had taken a picture.  They looked pitiful.  I hope they will go back to the normal size, but up the toppings as that was always needed.  Service was decent as usual."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Your typical burger restaurant. Nothing special here, average tasting burgers ranging from $11-17. Service is significantly slow even during non-busy hours. Wouldn't really recommend coming here unless it was the last resort."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Decent place to grab a burger for lunch - good selection of beers on tap - i've been told that they do whisky tastings too!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I've eaten at this restaurant many times since they opened, but today I found the food substandard.  I ordered the pacific white fish tacos and was given little nuggets of sautéed fish with lots of diced mango.  In the past it was a slice of filet.  This was really disappointing."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I do not like to give bad reviews but this place deserves a 2 star. Let me set the scene: Went for some after work drinks, we we apparently in ""no mans land"" the seating in the middle between bar and house seating. There were literally 9 people at the Bar, 3 Bartenders After 25 minutes of no one waited on us,  I looked around and there was groups of young staff standing around talking and ignoring. Went up to bar,  sat down at the bar and another 7 minutes later was helped, order two drinks $13.00 well and $10.00 beers! What? Another 12 minutes later and I see her just starting our drinks. 
20 minutes later (50 min waiting) we are seated ordered Waters, 15 min later they showed up. Ordered a burger, 20 min later we were fed up asked if the burger was started, he checked and said No! 35 min and we only received waters in that time WTF! 
We left and will never return!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Meet a friend here for hoppy hour.  It's right on the street and it's loud with traffic during that time.  Other than that noise, the ambiance of the place was nice.  

The waiters were friendly and attentive.  Only got their happy hour appetizers - the osso buco riblets, bruschetta, and the truffle fries with a few cocktails.  The riblets were not what I expected - although they were tender and fell off the little piece of bone they were attached to, they were drowned in buffalo sauce.  The truffle fries were fine, nothing extraordinary, but a good dish to munch on.  Bruschetta was my favorite of the three - good flavor and a layer of blue cheese or cream cheese before the tomatoes were stacked on gave it depth.  

I got one of their burgers to go for my husband at home which he said was delicious so I'll probably try to the burgers next time I'm there."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,One of my favorite spots for sure! The food is amazing and actually very affordable. They have great happy hour deals and fun steal the glass events on Wednesdays. The whole staff is really outgoing and friendly and very knowledgable. Awesome atmosphere as well. A+
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Visiting from Reno, Nevada, first time here. I ordered the bone marrow burger.  I don't eat gluten, so they are nice enough to wrap the burger in lettuce for me.  It was amazing.  Will certainly recommend it. The wait staff are friendly and engaging.  Will stop here again when I come back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I was hearing mix reviews from other locals, most not so great. But it's a new place in town so my wife and I gave it a try. We came here for lunch on a weekday and the place was really busy for lunch! We opted for the bar and the service was terrific! Had a great time and the food was excellent. We will definitely be back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Came in with a group of guys and got hammered ! Our bartender Tanner was hilarious, cracking jokes left and right. Easily the number one place to grab some drinks in SB. I highly recommend !!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Came in at around 11:00pm on 5/4 with my friend. Ambience seemed cool and we were looking a for a late bite and a drink. We weren't even half way done with our meal when our server dropped the check. No words just dropped the check and went along with her closing duties. I really wanted another beer to finish my meal. Our server was nowhere to be found. I was able to get the attention of another server and ordered a beer. She let me know it was last call, my reply was that our server never let us know. The manger was polite and ordered me a beer and brought back an updated tab. Our server then appears, grabs the check, makes sure the receipt is updated and brings it back. Again ZERO words have been said. Food is good but doubt we will be back. (I was a server for 10 years.. I get it..closing sucks but don't let your tips be affected)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Went here last night for my friend's birthday and was not disappointed. The restaurant itself is super cute and set up very nicely. Our waiter, I think her name was Ali?, was super sweet and friendly.  I ordered the Cowboy burger and oh my gosh it was heavenly. 10/10 would recommend. great service, great food, and great ambience. Definitely coming back!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I took a group of co-workers there for a celebration dinner tonight.  When I ordered a cocktail, I was told that they did not have my brand of tequila.  I was not surprised but asked what they had to offer.  The bartender said they only had one brand, an off-brand that I was not familiar with. I asked if I could have a taste to see if I wanted to go with it or a glass of red wine.  The bartender said that they do not offer ""tastes"" and I would have to order a drink if I wanted to taste it.  The bartender was pompous and clearly was not aware he was in the ""service"" industry. The manager caught wind of what was happening and bought me a drink, but made a comment that I found condescending about my desire for ""top-shelf"" tequila.  This place is run by a bunch of early 20 somethings who do not understand the word ""service"".  BTW - I am 47 years old, but when I could not read the menu due to small font and dim light, and I asked if they could round up some ""readers"", the waitress asked what ""readers"" were.  When I suggested that most restaurants keep a spare pair of magnifying glasses to help people, with not great vision, to see the menu, she laughed uncomfortably long and said no.

It is too bad that a company that put this much investment in a facility, would entrust it with a band of kids who did not care for the brand or have any training in service.

I run a service company and know what it takes to create customer loyalty, this team does not have what it takes."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Came here about an hour before closing a few months ago and very specifically asked the staff if they were trying to go home (which I would completely understand) or if eating food at this time would be ok. After being informed it wasn't a problem, and taking a seat, not only was my waiter completely miffed about serving me, but I continually heard both the waiter and the kitchen staff complaining about how terrible it was they had to cook my meal. (There were only about 5 tables total but other people were certainly eating as well) After a night of rude customer service, I could barely make it home before having the worst food poisoning I have possibly ever had. Instead of leaving a yelp review, I immediately contacted the owner with exact details as I felt this was somewhat deliberate - either my food was made purposefully bad or something was put in it. Although the owner originally seemed interested in getting to the bottom of this issue via email, once he saw that I might not press the issue further he went immediately back against his word, stopped emailing me and continued to run a poorly managed (possibly unhealthy) restaurant. There are very few restaurants in SB that I am completely scared of and this is certainly one of them."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Wow talk about this place being so tasty! It's so good but I'm pretty irritated with the servers constantly forgetting  to place my appetizers. The avocado egg burger is really delicious though. That's the main reason I come back.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"WARNING/UPDATE: The bartender at this establishment ""accidentally"" increased her tip by $4 on my last visit. The manager assured me that they probably ""misread"" my handwriting and that his employees are not crooks. Thankfully, he promptly refunded the $4. Changing the tip amount is fraud and should not be tolerated, whether it's $4 or $40. My advice to other customers is to take a picture of your reciept before you leave. I knew the service was bad, but this is criminal (literally)."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Went for lunch on a Monday, this was our second time here.  It wasn't too busy, but it took the waitress 10 minutes to come get our drink order. 
Bruschetta was very good, if you like balsamic and lemon...so it was a little different than the traditional. Riblets were awesome, but they should mention there are bones in each one. Wouldn't bother with the crab cakes again, just kind of bland. The margarita was good too, not too sweet."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love Eureka! The food is delicious and the drinks are so good. They have all of the classic, standard cocktails, as well as Eureka's own; all of them are fantastic. Last week I sat at the bar and got some brussel sprouts and a cocktail and it was the best! The bartender, Jordan, took such good care of me and was so fun to talk to - felt like we were old buddies :) She was also very attentive and super sweet. She also gave really great recommendations and was always around when I had a question. 

Such a good spot! I love this place!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Food was good and great potential overall. BUT beer selection was slim and heavily biased towards stone dist. Missing plenty of craft beers best breweries.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I was in town visiting and craving a good burger and fries experience so I looked this place up on yelp and saw the menu. I got the 38 day dry aged burger and Mac and cheese balls , and wife hot the American burger with slaw. We both shard the truffle fries and they were spot on! All food was great, friendly servers and nice clean outside seating plus a good size bar with many good beer choices. Prices were equal to the food and service!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Burgers, craft beer and a diverse whiskey list sound great on paper and I expected to be blown away. I found that while the tap list is worth coming back for, the overall experience left something to be desired.

I was helped by 5+ people during the duration of my dinner. Different people were taking orders, delivering food, getting drinks, etc. and it resulted in a rushed feel. They are extremely over-staffed from the looks of it and I know they just opened, so this isn't too big of a deal, but something to note. 

I ordered bruschetta as an appetizer and it was pretty good, though nothing outstanding. I would order it again. The fig marmelade burger was decent, though it seemed to add up to less than I was hoping for. The sweet potato fries were a definite letdown; way too sweet, and the cinnamon sprinkled on top doesn't help matters out. The food all has a hint of being from a chain - the produce isn't as fresh tasting as that from other similar restaurants around town and everything tastes very 'safe'. 

Anyways, the overall aesthetic of the restaurant is good but the experience was underwhelming. I would come back but not before Pace Food + Drink or Union Ale. I'll probably sit at the bar next time for drinks."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We are loyal to Eureka in Santa Barbara. We have the same food every Sunday and sit at the same table. Food is delicious, service is outstanding. Special thanks to David. You are a gem."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I have been a regular at Eureka Santa Barbara for years. In the last few months, the service has dropped off a cliff. Three visits ago, it took forever for a waiter to come by the first time, then again took a long, long time to place an order (and took a real long time for the food to arrive). A couple at another table got up and left after being ignored. I called over the manager and that improved things a bit. Two visits later (two nights ago), a buddy and I stopped by for dinner. It was a slow night, with plenty of empty tables. It took quite a while for a waitress to come by and we got water orders in. Receiving the water took a while and when dropping off the water, the waitress moved away so fast we could not place orders. After waiting for a long time for her to return, we got up and left.  Despite the food being pretty good, Eureka is being scratched off my restaurant list. It is a real shame, as I like the place."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great food, bone marrow burger was heavenly.  Brussells, riblets, excellent.
Server and hostess were friendly.  Their timing is a bit off - takes too long to get drinks, food came too fast after appetizers were served (but that's in a perfect world) but overall it's a great place, great atmosphere, a bit pricey but worth it."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Excellent food, fun ambience, and great service! Couldn't ask for a better dinner! Pretty inexpensive too. We ordered the sweet potato fries, corn dogs, mac n cheese, watermelon and kale quinoa salad, Napa burger, and the chocolate soufflé. Definitely coming back soon!! Wasn't one item I didn't like :)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I came here on a Friday around lunch time for the first time. As first impressions go, it was a cool little spot. So here's my grade for the outing...

FOOD: (A) I ordered the Italian Caprese Burger, had the Sweet Honey Cinnamon         Potato fries, and my group split the Panko Crusted onion rings (they were hefty).  Food was good but not great.

SERVICE: (B) The waiter got us our food on a timely matter but mistaken one of the plates, but they made up for it. All the workers were nice but some other waiters seemed a little lost as they were trying to find the tables for the plates.

ATMOSPHERE: (A) Got in just before the lunch rush and  but it seemed like a good crowd. There's indoor and outdoor seating which makes it nice on those sunny days and the place seems pretty clean.

Finally got to check this place out, and I'd visit again!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,The food is really good and has vegetarian options as well. The staff is very friendly and courteous. Highly recommended if you want good food and drinks in Santa Barbara downtown.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Yep this place was good! The mini corn dogs were delish!! I found this place on Yelp, we were staying up the street and had just arrived and needed food right away! 

This place was cool, it was nice and breezy sunny Thursday afternoon, the service was good and I would come back if in the area."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Stumbled upon this place while my husband and I were in town for my birthday and decided to go here for my birthday dinner. This place is awesome! Cool vibe and played good music. Can be on the louder side inside if you don't mind that. The staff was super friendly, and our server was so funny and nice and gave great recommendations! Wish I caught his name, I'd do a shoutout here! Haha. The food was pretty good and was brought out quick. Definitely will come back the next time we're in town! :)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Food is so ridiculously over priced for the quality. I was told the burgers are grass feed meat which I understand is more pricey but everything else is just ok. Not worth spending almost $20 a person for dinner here.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"came here not knowing it was in the mall. :(

That was a disapointment but we sat at the bar and service was pretty good.

The boys burger was good and my nachos were just ok.

Beer selection was pretty good and the place was clean and bright."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"They have a ton of beers on tap, but the food was meh. And it's too expensive for what you're actually getting.

My gf and I ordered burgers and wings. Mine was a blue cheese burger with mushrooms and grilled onions. Hers was the Napa burger with pesto aioli. Because of food-borne illness concerns with ground beef, we always order our burgers well-done.

My gf's burger was tasty (particularly the creamy pesto sauce) but it was NOT well-done. It was clearly pink, almost red in the middle. Medium-rare cooked beef could NEVER be confused with well-done. The kitchen staff needs to be retrained to better track which burgers went on the grill at what time so that well-done orders are actually fully cooked.

My blue cheese burger was boring and flavorless. There were not enough chunks of blue cheese, too many mushrooms, and the variety of blue cheese used was some Americanized bland ""safe"" blue cheese used to not offend American palates. Also, the blue cheese crumbles were not melted as described on the menu, so they simply tumbled out of the burger with the tiny mushroom chunks every time I picked it up. Most of my time was spent picking up chunks of blue cheese and mushrooms from my plate and putting them back in the burger.

BTW - My burger was not just well-done, but too well-done. It was dry and mealy in the middle. Overall, the grill person that day sucked.

The sides of fries we got were pathetically small. Considering that the fries are the LEAST expensive item on a burger plate, there should have been twice as much. Their ketchup was weird as well - it tasted sweet and tangy, and had a bizarre flavor I could not place. It was similar to carrot juice, which made the ketchup taste like a thick V8 drink.

NOTE - some of the pictures here show large mounds of french fries on the plate next to a burger. These pictures are NOT current. They have decreased their serving sizes and now put the fries in TINY little white cups to create the illusion you're getting a lot. Realistically, their french fry portions now match a ""small"" fries from someplace like McDonalds.

We also had garlic chili chicken wings, which were WAY too sweet, drenched in honey with barely a flake or two of chili peppers. I could not taste any garlic on them.

There are many other places in downtown Santa Barbara to get a burger with fries, and I'm sure most of them surpass the food at Eureka."

Comi um salmão bem gostoso com aspargus! O da minha amiga que era tacos de camarão pareceu maravilhoso!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"What a great location in Santa Barbara, went in to Eureka on Friday night, the entire staff was so friendly.. We had amazing drinks, (eureka punch & their margarita) and for dinner we had the Teriyaki Salmon & Chicken Sandwich which were both so good!!!! Chelsea, our server was the best, she was so sweet, attentive and made us feel so welcomed- like family! Definitely go back!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Went here last night to grab a few beers.  My buddy had raved about his experience at other Eureka's and I had high hopes.  The beer list is great, among the top two or three in SB and not overpriced.  $3 Hoppy Poppy last night is darn cheap by SB standards.  The beer selection and pricing was the upside.  

The appetizers, ambiance, lighting and noise level were all down sides.  

Food: We had an order of the corn dog pops and sweet potato fries.  The emphasis was really on sweet on both of these, with honey and cinnamon on the fries and very sweet hot dogs in the corn dogs, almost dessert dishes both.  

Ambiance, Lighting and Noise:  Eureka was nice coming in, the lights were up, and although noisy it was tolerable.  After being seated and getting our beers, the lights were totally turned off when the reggae band started and it became a loud, dark, music venue and lost the appeal of a hip beer bar and burger instantly.  I'm glad I wasn't eating because it would have ruined the meal not being able to see what I was eating.  The music was excessively loud and conversation at our table ceased and communicating with servers became difficult.

I'm hoping the lighting and noise levels were opening night festivities.  With live acoustic music and the lights on this will become a great dinner destination, otherwise this will be a very solid happy hour hangout and that is it."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Next tip: as a server, don't wait until your guests have finished to check back and see how everything was. They have implemented an orange card to make sure your table has been visited (another hint is drinks and menus on the table)."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I wanted to love this place so badly! It opened up shortly after I moved back to San Diego, and my friends rave about it so I knew we had to stop in when I visited. We went for dinner on a Sunday and it was super packed but our group of 6 got seated pretty quickly.

My boyfriend and I split:
-An appetizer that I don't remember, so it wasn't toooo memorable :P I kick myself for not getting the riblets! I tried someone else's and they were amazing!
-The Italian Caprese burger: I liked the vinaigrette but the mozzarella wasn't very tasty at all. Overall a very plain burger that was over-cooked (we ordered medium)
-The sweet potato honey cinnamon fries: Okay, I LOVE sweet potato fries, but these were just gross. They were mushy and drenched in honey, which made them waaay too dessert-like to go with a burger. I barely touched them.

I'd go back with a group to give this place another shot, but I'd never choose this place myself. Good place to hang out, but the food is overpriced for what it is."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We were strolling through the shops on State Street and came across this restaurant at one of the corners of Paseo Nuevo shopping area. We saw the hamburgers everyone were eating and had to go in to give it a try. There is outdoor seating which was great on this sunny day. Service was prompt and we were seated right away. 

The menu ranged from appetizers to salads to burgers to entrees. 

We had:

Onion rings: huge...we ordered a side of this and got four rings. But they were about two inches thick and came with ranch dipping sauce. 

I ordered the pearl street blues burger which had melted blue cheese, sautéed mushrooms, grilled onions and chipotle ketchup. It comes with fries but you can upgrade to sweet potato fries, cole slaw, salad or soup for an extra $1.50. I chose the sweet potato fries and was glad i did. It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. There is honey drizzled on it too. Super good and would order again. The burger was big and thick. I asked that it be well done and it was cooked perfectly...still juicy on the inside. The meat was well seasoned and chipotle ketchup gave it a nice kick. 

Bf ordered Fresno fig burger which had goat cheese, bacon and fig marmalade. he liked his and i tried a bit of it. The bacon and fig gave it a sweet and smoky flavor. He had the regular fries with his burger and they were passible but nothing special...a bit soggy for my taste. 

I would give this place 3.5 stars if i could put since i can't i will kick it up to 4 just for the sweet potato fries."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Great. Lemme say it again, great food!!
Service by our trainee was awesome, her trainer was not so nice"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Good burgers and reasonable prices.  Very loud but fun place.  The fig jam on burger is great.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka burger is the best place in Santa Barbara to get a burger. A little expensive but understandable when you dive into one of the burgers or any of the appetizers.  Happy hour is definitely the time to dine here, great deals on food and drinks! The bone marrow burger might be be best burger out there, simple and amazing!  The service was great also, our server was kelly and she was amazing, cannot go wrong with anything on the menu! 

Hands down go to for a date night or to catch a game."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Get the mac n' cheese balls. You know you want to, and you know they're going to be delicious. Make the right choice, and screw your diet for the night."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Had a really bad experience at Eureka a couple of weeks ago. I was pretty sure I was never ever going to return to the location however my concerns were addressed by the managers Lindsay and Kevin. I love eureka love the food love the staff (except one supervisor) :-) it'd been the best spot for our friends and family to meet up at. Thanks to the response and outreach from management I will continue to come back to eureka.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The food, ambiance is great, but the service SUCKS! Hire people with wait staff experience and people skills. After 3x's visiting u would think it would be better STRIKE OUT"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Disappointed this Eureka location wasn't at ALL like the SLO location we'd went to before. 
On winter break we decided to stop in for food there while shopping around State Street in Santa Barbara. 
First off, the dark-haired hostess was slightly dismissive and rude. I smiled when walking up and waited for a minute before saying hello, she looked towards me then continued her conversation with another worker. Finally she turns to me and without a smile says hello. I asked for a table for four, again, zero smile or enthusiasm. I don't expect a high five or big hug, but it's your job to greet people, do that then.  She blankly tells us it'll be about 30 minutes. 
We sit at the bar and order a couple drinks, bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. Eureka is a dark bar meaning they specialize in dark liquors such as whiskey or scotch. They had only one type of vodka, but his cocktail was still fine. Husband ordered a dark beer upon his request which he says was pretty good. 
Finally seated, our server who looked like Brad from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, came over after a few long minutes and recommended a couple things. Very friendly, he seemed to have too many tables though, didn't look to be his fault, perhaps another server was absent? Mismanagement? Service was SLOOOW. Almost 1.5 hours for dinner? For salad and burgers? No. 
Food, I don't know. Just not that impressed. I had a turkey burger, husband and one daughter had burgers, other daughter got a chicken Cesar salad, these are not innovative, mind blowing recipes. Everything was just, eh.... I remember the food at the SLO location being much better. 
Would I return? Probably no."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"One of our favorite places downtown! Lucien took very good care of us and our food was delicious, as always. Great beer selection and wine list.....coming during happy hour gets you some great deals! The manager was also extremely helpful and friendly"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Great burger joint in the mall directly across from CPK. Has a fantastic selection of craft beers on draft that rotate all the time. The food is very good the staff is fantastic and they have a great happy hour on food and beers. One of my favorites is the osso bucco riblets. For a full order for 5 bucks you can not beat it. Trust me get in order and you will get another one.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?!?!?!? About 3 years ago, I LOVED this place. Used to take my staff here for lunches and dinners all the time. Then all of a sudden the menu changed, the food quality dropped, and the prices went up. The one thing that has kept these guys afloat is staff. They do have good staff and well trained. But there are way better options for a cheaper price. What really tipped me off to the idea that this place has really changed was tonight a few friends wanted to go grab a few bites and some drinks. 7pm on a Friday we expected to have to wait for a party of seven. The place was half empty.... it used to be at least an hour wait for any table in the place when they first opened. I don't know the answer here but please fix this Eureka!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"If you're in the mood for a truly delicious burger in Santa Barbara, this is the place to go.  It's not as inexpensive as some other options, but the ingredients are better quality than any of the other burger joints here that come to mind.  Also, they have a lot more options.  The Fig Marmalade burger is my favorite.  They have quite a few interesting combinations and options of burgers and within their other entrees as well.

I also really appreciate the environment.  It's a bit loud and can be hard to talk inside, but it's always lively.  It's a modern space, but comfortable.

They also have a big selection of beer and good well drinks.

The food, the drinks and the environment make Eureka an awesome downtown dinner option, especially with friends.  It's a fun place to go with excellent food and not terribly expensive for downtown/late night dining."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Stumbled on the restaurant while touring downtown SB. I had the fish tacos and French fries which were delicious and my fiancé had the skirt steak which he LOVED. Not to mention I tried my first gluten-removed IPA here and was in heaven! The food and the service was fantastic so we will both be back next time we're in SB.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We had the Eureka American Cheeseburger and the Fresno Fig Burger. Both were outstanding.  Maybe not quite as good as Mesa Burger, but close contenders.  

The American Cheeseburger was tall and generously loaded with a thick high quality patty cooked to order.  They lightly grilled the red onions and the cheese was top grade. Altogether a tasty burger.  

The Fig burger was even better.  It featured fig jam spread for a sweet touch, paired with melted goat cheese and bacon. How could you go wrong?  

I opted for the coke slaw, which often is hot and miss, but theirs was a hit including chipped almonds and good sauce.  My wife had their buffalo chili soup, which was pretty spicy and very flavorful in a good way. 
 
We also took advantage of their amazing beer menu. Our favorite is a local IPA by Topa Topa called White Chief.  $7 for a pint.  Was a fantastic choice to pair up with the main  course."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"One of the BEST burger places you can find. I was only there for vacation but omg I would so go back just to go to this place. Eureka come to Austin, Texas! I miss you! :)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Finally had the chance to try this place after hearing a few friends talking about it. I wasn't feeling a burger, which I know is what they are known for, but I decided to try the all day breakfast burrito. This burrito was very flavorful and filling! I loved that the egg was placed on top instead of inside the burrito. The beer was pretty good and the service was very quick and the staff was very friendly! Definitely recommend this place!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The whole family had burgers of different sorts. I had the Bison burger and it was really good. Fries where ok , not superb more as expected and portions medium size .
Service was a 5er, Good recomendations on the wine, the kids where treated as any other (adult)guest and the waitress went the xtra mile to make our dinner here as good as possible . Would definetly go back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Burgers were great and a good selection of drinks. 

Service was pretty bad. They took forever to take our drink order, forgot appetizers and a burger, mixed up a drink order and had to correct the bill."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Came here for the first time the other day, our waiter was a short girl with grayish purple hair. She took our order for drinks & left. When our drinks came out I was given the wrong drink, that was okay I understand mistakes happen. After that, our waiter NEVER CAME BACK. After we waited 45 minutes we let another waiter know that we were leaving due to the terrible service & wanted the check. He apologized & said he took our order instead. After an hour and 30 minutes of being in this restaurant we finally got our food, which wasn't even worth it at the end. Wouldn't recommend unless you get a waiter that actually cares about you."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"My visit to Eureka was SO pleasant! My friend and I stopped here for a bite to eat before a night out. It was Friday night, the wait was about 25 minutes, but we were able to order drinks at the bar and time flew by very fast! We ordered Bloody Mary's, which I can honestly say is one of the best I have had! 

For dinner we ordered the Fig Burger and house salad with the parsley dressing. The burger was delicious!! The fig spread added some sweetness to it. I regretted every bite I took because I was that much closer to finishing my burger, it was SO yummy. Definitely recommend this place! Service was amazing too, the manager would walk around making everything was perfect, and it was! Thanks Eureka :)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Great food, great selection of beers and drinks. Consistently HORRIBLE service. After finishing our lunch, our plates sat in front of us for no less than 20 minutes while our WAITress cashed out a table of ten with individual checks. The MOD bussed the table just vacated by the check payers and reset fork by fork. I had to physically place my chair in the aisle as he tried to pass by us. No apology for the issue. The table next to us waited 10 minutes until their waiter showed. My wife has had similar experiences with her visits there."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I've been going to Eureka since the week of their soft opening and prior to last night, each experience has been outstanding.  

Unfortunately, last night I brought a group of coworkers visiting from out-of-town for a meal and the service was a complete trainwreck. One member of our party didn't receive his first drink order for over 30 minutes.. the food even beat his drink to the table. 

Three different waiters were asked for help, but despite promises to ""take care of it right away"" the drink just never showed up. Evenutally we had to get the manager involved... no one should have to do that just to get a drink delivered to their table! It was mind-boggling that such a simple task could turn into such a resounding, multilayered failure.

It's a shame that I can no longer recommend this restauarant, because their beer and whiskey selection is excellent and the food is good. But the service needs serious work and I won't be taking another chance on it any time soon."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Really sad to write this review. This is one of my favorite joints on my lunch break or for a casual dinner. But tonight, my fries were way over cooked my steak (asked for medium) was rare. The nachos had stale chips and my server was no where in site. The servers also switched on us without letting us know so we had no idea who to look for. I hope they don't treat all their guests like this... Wish we had gone somewhere else tonight."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"We work down the street and are always excited for a new restaurant to open that's not Mexican and that has a full bar. The place is fantastic looking, it's open and airy, and has a great décor. There are a good amount of TVs and seems like it could be a good watering hole for sporting shenanigans. We got the corn dog balls and a couple burgers, which were all pretty great. Their menu is like porn and makes you want to try one of everything. Unfortunately, a deal breaker for our crowd is the drinks. They are extremely strict with the alcohol quantity. They use a jigger for their mixed drinks, and monitor beer alcohol levels by glass size. They offer three sizes for beer: small, tea cup and thimble. The bartender came out and was very nice and explained that they don't want their patrons getting too drunk. So unfortunately we had to write this spot off as our new sports bar. If they can start serving Santa Barbara sized drinks, and it doesn't have to be Joe's level, then I think they would get much more traffic and loyal customers. We would love to keep coming, but until they get the drink situation under control, or less under control, I don't think we'll be regulars quite yet. Priorities aside, the food was quite great, I'd definitely take my grandmother."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Died and came back from heaven here. Literally this was the most amazing burger i wanted to cry when i ate it. I've been to Cali twice now in my life - and both times i got eureka. i am now beginning a campaign to get eureka to open up next door to my nyc apartment so everyone here on the east coast can experience the amazingness. This place is amazing because it is an incredibly cool casual restaurant - they have every single craft beer and whiskey and other alcohol you can imagine which to me is awesome to try new interesting beers with your food. the staff was also really friendly. as for the food, FRIKIN YUM. 

here is what i've tried:
- osso buco riblets - little bite sized pieces of tender meat covered in a delicious red wine type of sauce. they were a perfect appetizer because they are small enough to not be too filling but have a ton of flavor
- original burger - just amazing tender meat with a delicious sauce. not your standard 
""original"" burger 
- Catalina bison burger - TRY THIS BURGER IT IS LIFE CHANGING. the burger has a bacon-infused jalapeno sauce on it and then is covered in peppers, onion and mozzarella. before trying it i was unsure whether i should have ordered something else, but now it is my favorite burger ever. the different flavors really compliment each other and its SO delicious. 
- Fresno fig burger - really interesting different and delicious burger. it has a fig sauce on it with soft melted goat cheese, bacon and onion. this was really great because the goat cheese onion and fig really blended well and tasted amazing with the beef burger. 
- sweet potato fries - sooooo good. they are crunchy yet still soft inside. they come covered in a honey cinnamon spice and just are really really good
- truffle fries - yum. above average fries with a delicious truffle sauce all over them

here is what else i'm dying to try: everything 

overall, this place is great because the food is sooo amazing and they have an excellent selection of craft beer and other drinks. Good for any occasion (and great outdoor seating)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Don""t go there if you are not 100% American.They don't like foreign people at all.Treat  you like animals.I am from Ireland,I went there with friends to watch some games and they treated us so badly,took forever to serve ,act like they don't understand us and laugh,saying:those kind people don't deserve anything because they don't pay well.Wake Eureka"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Loved the atmosphere, drink selection, and beer list. It was difficult choosing what to order because their were many of my favorites on the menu, bison, lamb, gourmet burgers. I settled with the cowboy burger and was very happy with it. 

The service was the best I've had in a very long time, our server Doug was really knowledgeable about the beer/food selection, was super friendly, and always there to make sure we had what we needed.

There was live music and a great vibe, I'd hang out at the bar even if I wasn't going to be ordering food.

I'll definitely be going back - soon!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Stopped in to Eureka on a visit to Santa Barbara and we were very pleased to say the least.  The ceviche was delicious and their drinks are poured very well.  The wait staff & management were very friendly and accommodating.  We will definitely be back!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Service was atrocious!
Appetizer: Truffle fries didn't taste fresh and were quite overdone 
Main meal: We waited over 45 minutes for our watermelon salad and fig marmelade burger. During this, we had NO service - NO ONE came by to check on us. We were just about ready to get up and ask for our bill when the food arrived.  Food wasn't bad, but the poor service killed our experience."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"People, let me lay it down for you. I was a MAJOR Eureka fan. My boyfriend and I went on our first date here for Pete's sake. The ambiance is unbeatable and the music selection is awesome. Otherwise, this place officially sucks the big one. Here's why:

It was a rainy Thursday night and we felt like somewhere cozy with a fun atmosphere. Eureka ticks those boxes. 

When we walked in, two rather surly 20-something dudes with man buns rolled their eyes and asked my boyfriend ""how many"". No ""Welcome to Eureka, how can we help you?"" That should have been the first red flag.

We shrugged it off and put our names down for the 15 minute wait time as told by Man Bun #1. We also have the app that allows you to track your place in line so we figured we'd go brave the rain and wait for our table outside.

Fast forward this party train to 45 minutes later.  I eat out a lot, I am a frequent restaurant goer. I understand that hosts ""guestimate"" how long a wait will be and I am a generally patient patron when it comes to wait times. When we walked back in, neither Man Bun #1 or #2 acknowledged our existence as they were too busy wiping down menus. At this time, there was no one waiting in the waiting area and there appeared to be empty tables. Our app said we were ""next in line"". We asked politely how much longer they thought our wait would be and was given the nonchalant answer of ""there's a table you can have now"". Cool so...were you planning on utilizing your texting system or.....just not letting us know about our table ever...

We sat down at our table after being given our sticky menus (were they using honey water to clean these??) and were approached by our equally surly 20-something waitress who had the opening greeting of ""Drinks?"". No name, no how are you, nada. At that point, I had pretty much lost whatever cool I had left and promptly stormed out of the restaurant. Hungry, irritated, and offended I decided that sorry Eureka. I pay to have an enjoyable experience at a restaurant and I will not be paid to be treated like absolute crap. Pretty sad considering I used to be one of their biggest fans. We ended up eating at the Public  Market which I highly recommend for actual customer service and delicious food."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Glory glory hallelujah!! The third time is a charm for Eureka, apparently! I had a disappointing first visit here in January and an equally disappointing second visit at the La Jolla location earlier this month, which made me wonder what the heck all these positive reviews are for. I gave the SB location another shot last Friday because my friends adore the place, and I finally got the experience I have been searching for!

My group of 4 others and I enjoyed some Sculpin and Racer 5s (YEESSSSSS!) while waiting at the bar for our table. We were seated in about 10 minutes, which was when we met our strangely jumpy yet cute and attentive server. My boyfriend and I split the corn dog lollipop appetizer, which was overpriced for the size but delicious nonetheless. And then, the burgers came. I was practically biting my nails waiting, as I still couldn't understand how everybody I know gushes over their fantastic burgers while I'm eating one that is extremely unmemorable. I've had the Maui and the Italian Caprese, and this time I tried the Fig Marmalade burger with fries on the side. OOOHHHH GOOODNESS. So good!!! That bacon jam spread is incredible! And I hate arugula but somehow it was bearable with the other ingredients. My only gripes are that the patty was a little overcooked (I order medium and it always comes out with no pink here) and that there was a ton of fries but they were all TINY. Overall, a successful dining experience though! My boyfriend ordered the bison burger and enjoyed it equally as much. In fact, he liked it so much that within 15 minutes of leaving he ate the half of my burger that I had boxed up - BIG FREAKING NO NO IN MY BOOK but that's another story :P

I agree with some other reviewers that Eureka, as a new establishment, has a few kinks to work out, but this visit combined with my unexpected (and impressive) communications with guest services on Yelp gave me promise that they will get there!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Sometimes you just want a quick reasonably-priced casual meal in a fun setting with a great beer selection and Eureka delivers. The price to value ratio is great ($10.50 for two mahi mango tacos including fries) and $4 for a pint of Hoppy Poppy IPA (to compare, it's $9 at Honor Bar). Their ""Hoppy Hour"" makes it even more attractive to the wallet.

Cons are the burgers are just OK (go to Wine Cask, Jane or Honor Bar for better) and the service is eager but uneven, took forever to get our drinks. Also it's a young, rambunctious crowd so not a romantic night out but gets the job done, especially if you are or are taking out a bunch of 20-somethings."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I've been here many times and love it! Outdoor seating, indoor seating and a long bar with five tvs to watch your favorite sports teams.  I always order the same thing...the steak salad. It's perfect in every way! Lots of different beers from local brewers and a full bar.  Open late and always busy.  Staff is mostly college students so I make sure to leave a good tip each time!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"My friends and I came across Eureka during their soft opening for family and friends.  We went in anyway and they basically catered to our every need.  We sat at the bar and got to experience the pleasure of Johnny and Sarah, two excellent staff members.  The food was good, the drinks were good, the beer was amazing and we all loved the live music.  We will definitely be coming back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I work in the restaurant industry, so I am very picky when it comes to dining out... Especially when it comes to service. Eureka was nothing short of amazing. The two servers I had were not only adorable, but attentive, kind, and knowledgable of the menu. You will be more than satisfied if Kayce or Alex serve you! The manager Jacqui was beyond incredible as well. Not only did she help us with menu items, but she gave us recommendations for Santa Barbara because we are new in town. Eureka is definitely my new ""spot"" and I would highly advise anyone to try it out! Plus, the food is amazing :) thanks Eureka!!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Hands down the best burger in Santa Barbara. Pick any one of their burgers and it will be amazing (I know, I've tried almost all of them). The only thing better then the burgers is their selection of beers. They have a great selection of micro brews on tap, and are constantly are rotating them. I definitely recommend Eureka to anyone in Santa Barbara."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I will start by saying that my burger was great!
Blue cheese, mushrooms, sautéed onions, bacon...the bun was substantial enough to hold everything without being heavy. Opted for panko breaded onion rings. Three came with my burger, but they were the best onion rings I've had in a long time!
Service is good...three or four different people stopped by my table.
A very noisy crowd, lots of college age people. A couple TV's showing whatever sports happens to be on (NBA & NHL!!)   
A great place to eat, as long as you don't want to carry on a conversation!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This was our first time to Eureka! The food was amazing, the service at first was a little slow, but the place was swamped. Matt, the General Manager was very professional and personable. Will definitely be back for the beers and burgers. Awesome place to watch sports too!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The service here is so, so very bad...

Was seated with friends. Saw bunches of servers standing at the station while we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to greet us.

So we got up and left...

I normally go to Eureka in LA and OC and have a good experience, but not so at this location."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I love This restaurant chain.. Service is always friendly, cocktails are amazing.. One of the few places to get a rum swizzle outside of Bermuda... They have a vast varieties of beers on tap that change monthly.  Burgers are delicious... Ok here is the reason for negative stars.. Their chef needs to learn what the different wellness of beef.  For some reason at this location only.. Doesn't matter how you ask for your beef you are going to either get it rare or well done.  The kitchen has no concept of medium.  I'm pregnant and specifically told the server I need the beef to be lightly pink.. I cannot eat beef rare.. What happens I get I medium rare-rare burger.. The girl next to me order a steak salad medium.. Her steak comes out rare.. I was catching a movie so I couldn't send it back.. I didn't have the time.. In the past years me getting a medium rare burger wasn't an issue.. Unfortunately now it's a big issue.. One of these days the kitchen is going to get someone sick.. I hate sending food back to the kitchen and at this location I've had to send it back twice before because it wasn't cooked they way I ordered it.. Not a big deal when you have eaten here over a dozen times but it's just an annoyance..  Please please kitchen be careful and pay attention to how people want their beef cooked.."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I was thoroughly impressed. Even though I've only visited once, I thought the food was excellent and I'm looking forward to going back. I had the classic burger, subbed with a turkey patty (deliciously juicy) as well as the watermelon salad. The watermelon salad was a hit- the balsamic vinaigrette mixed with kale, arugula, walnuts, cranberries, feta cheese, and quinoa was just perfect! 4 stars and not 5 because the service was a little slow and our waitress asked us about 3 times if we were done with our plate and I finally just said yes so she would stop asking. Definitely will be back, hopefully will get another waitress ;)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Such great too, always!!  
I had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly; crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The salad that came with it was dressed just right too.
Amuse order are the sweet potato fries!!  Just do it!  You'll thank me later. ;)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The Napa burger is DELICIOUS. Good service, good selection of beers. Great location too - right by the movie theatre and shopping."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This weeks Farmers Market cocktail ""persimmon of interest"" is delicious! And you honestly can't go wrong with any of the burgers. Service can be slow at times, but overall a great atmosphere"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Worst service and mediocre food.  My co-worker and I decided to stop by for lunch.  I was hesitant because my last two experiences were not great.  

Today, it took 10 minutes to seat us even though the table we ended up at was empty from the time we walked up.  There was only one group of two ahead of us.  Not sure why it took so long.  

Once seated, we waited with our menus for 10 minutes, ordered both food and drinks at the same time. 

Our food came out about 20 minutes after ordering.  Unfortunately, we had to remind the server to bring our drinks.  It took 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive - I was mostly done eating by then. The burger was OK - definitely not worth the time spent there.

We finished our food and waited for the check. No one stopped by to see how we were doing or if we needed anything.  After waiting 15 minutes, we had to go ask the hostess to bring our check.  She said she would have our server bring it by.  I watched as she went over to our server and pointedly asked them to bring our check.  10 minutes later, still no check.  So we asked a nearby server (same one that the hostess had talked to) if she could get us our check.  She seemed annoyed but said she would.   10 more minutes - a different server brought our check - and I immediately handed my credit card to them.  It took another 10 minutes before he brought me the receipt to sign off on.  It took almost 45 minutes after we finished eating for us to get our check and leave.  The worst part was the place was half-full and I could see servers standing around.  

Very frustrating experience.  With so many great options to eat in downtown Santa Barbara, I will never be back and will definitely let people know about my poor experience at Eureka!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Nice beer selection that changes frequently. The outdoor seating is fun, albeit with spotty service.  Energetic vibe at the bar, just the right size. The rest of the restaurant is nondescript and has somewhat of a chain feel. Burgers are the best bet.  Good place to go at last minute and with moderate expectations."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The Pearl Street Blues Burger on medium patty was full of flavor and very filling. I substituted the fries with onion rings (extra $) which came in 3 but they were HUGE! 

Got the Sculpin IPA even thought I don't usually drink in the early afternoons. 

The only thing that's somewhat disappointing was the Eureka! truffle fries which came out to be partially soggy.

However, it was an enjoyable experience overall. I'll definitely come back for sure."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great beer, great food, great staff!! The staff at eureka burger in Santa Barbara made a great day for us! Everything from the truffle fries, to the burgers, to the nachos were awesome. The beer list is legit and always some great rotating handles being introduced. What more can you say.... 5 stars bar none."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,This is one of go to places for our team lunch. Food is so yummy and good presentation. But it does need to wait a bit. It all worths it. Staffs are very friendly. Environment is good.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I am in love with the Napa burger here! such a yummy burger place that has so many good options
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This is a trendy hipster-ish setting with a good menu and beer selection. They also put some considerable effort into curating a whisky/ bourbon/scotch selection. Food is good, atmosphere is good, and I experienced EXCELLENT service. 

Note: I reserve 5 stars for the absolute best of the best. Four stars for me is a very good rating."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love this place! So tasty, fair prices, sensational staff, and a revolutionary beer rotation! Ethan and Gabby are the best bartenders I've ever had! Their attention to detail are what I love and find incredible!!!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"this place at best only deserves 2.5 stars solely because of their Happy Hour and That they offer it late night Happy Hour and because of their 2 good servers Stephanie and this one guy that looks like he should be in the 300 movie. 

Their riblets are bomb and so are the chicken nachos, ask for beans on the side they'll give you more beans than the teeny sprinkle that they norm put on them. 


Other than that ""Eureka!"" has greasy oversized nasty plain burgers that take forever to make and serve. 
Onion rings are huge and HUGELY disappointing. it once took a server 20mins to bring me a ranch I had asked to add flavor to my rings..and the server never gave me a refill I had asked of my iced tea.. and rudely dropped the check at my mother face up. not at all discreetly or even a thank you or enjoy the rest of your night..

I never wanted to go back til my mother bribed me and dragged me to their happy hour. I was mildly impressed but really it was Stephanie that wowed me and changed my mind. I love get and only sit in her section.

EVERY Server except for the two I mentioned will ask you for a refill only never to be seen until they drop check or a dish. 


other than that eureka is an average place( unless you're in Stephanie's section or Sparta's section)  if you are lookin for a delicious burger walk down to the habit, if you want a gourmet burger go to Lucky's or Jane"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka! is the best place in Santa Barbara if your looking for a wide selection of craft beer and unique small batch whiskey's. Not to mention there amazing food. Yes we all know that you may have to be willing to wait for a seat, but that goes to speak for there outstanding selection of spirits, beer, and great food. I really like all the specialty sauces that they make for there foods. I hate to see the typical yelp snobs whining about this place because complaining is doing a disservice to the SB food scene. My opinion is that you can't go wrong with a burger or some great nachos and a pint of something tasty from Eureka! Thanks Eureka! staff for keeping the beer's flowing and putting a smile on the faces of your patrons."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Awesome spot for a double date.  Their burgers are killer!  Definitely worth the calorie splurge.  Craft beer selection was great too.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"INCREDIBLE BURGERS. Actually, EVERYTHING is good. Love the Fig Marmalade burger.

Their variety of beers is extensive and always changing with new, great beers. The fries are delicious and the staff are very friendly and attentive.

Last time I ate there, I was in a party of 14. Our waiter was fantastic with great spirit and suggestions. He actually knew the beers and never got overwhelmed by the size of our party."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Not the best burger in town!

Service isn't bad, though.

This is probably a fine place to stop for beers and snacks if you are a tourist, but don't come here for the burger. Cheesy, faux-hip LA atmosphere. Fries were bland as well.

Places with better gourmet burgers in town:

Tre Lune (Montecito)
Paradise Cafe (Ortega, Downtown)
The Shop (Milpas)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,My life will never be the same... Ever. I ordered the Bone Marrow Burger and a side of bacon jalapeño infused jam. The first half of the burger I ate so fast in fear the world was about to end and I wouldn't get to finish it. :) One of the staff members brought over a bowl of water for my dog and another brought over a plate of watermelon and avocado for my best friend's toddler. We had such a great experience. I will be back next time I am in California.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka Restaurant at corner of Chapala and De Lagurra on the periphery of the Santa Barbara Paseo Nuevo Mall. This open air eatery has inside and outside seating with roadside dining really close to a street w moderate two way and cross street traffic.

Even Though it was busy the noise from guest and traffic was low enough to engage without yelling. We were greeted quickly at height of lunch and offered in or outside dinning. Tables are nicely spaced with heavy duty wooden  chairs.  

The bar is full service with a large selection of off brand beers. If you appetizer please go for the panko crusted onion rings. You get four large rings perfectly and crusted just enough to delight but not saturate to the point of not wanting to finish your entree. 

The menu is more salad and burger which fits well with the location and price. My Fresno Fig Goat cheese burger was done to perfection on a toasted bun. The burger had just enough on it to make eating by hand doable without constant napkin assistance. While you get fries as the side opt out and get the sweet potato fries which was drizzled with honey... 

Service was attentive and always with a real smile... There wad no rush to get you out the door. This is a baby friendly restaurant verified by three separate couples with babies in tow and enough space to accommodate mini tank size strollers. Best lunch along the coast."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Food great- service NOT. 

Went in to enjoy dinner and drinks with a friend- we are both in the customer service industry locally, and have to say service was definitely not up to standard. I understand this is a new establishment, but as you watch your server, not 1 but all eat off another patron's plate- EW! As they were serving us, they would stop by a friends table and pick off their plate sitting, right next to us- so gross. Having to wait for silverware and napkins was also annoying. The place was packed, has a good vibe, good live music, but the servers are awkward, kind of lurk around the table not anticipating your needs.

I did appreciate the manager asking two drunken guys that were harassing our table.... now if he could just get ahold of his staff's hunger problems..."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I have been several times now, and this place is awesome. They have unique, delicious burgers with flavor combinations that you don't find often, and a full selection of whiskey from top-notch, to old-school, to trendy. I've tried half the burgers on the menu and I would order every single one of them again, but my two favorites are the fig marmalade and catalina bison. Their french fries are thin and crispy - just the way I like them, and if you have a sweet tooth their sweet potato fries are drizzled with honey! The service is good, I can't think of anything that has ever gone wrong.

The only drawback to Eureka! is that they do not take reservations and it can get really busy - so I wouldn't recommend large groups at the dinner rush on the weekends. If you have a party of two they usually work you in really quickly and I have never had to wait longer than 20 minutes, and in the mean time you can go shopping because they take your phone number and just text you when your table is ready! Or, you can sit and enjoy a drink at their bar while you wait - there is always sports on TV to entertain you."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Appetizer arrived at the same time our burgers arrived? My burger was over cooked and the bacon was super hard not even eatable. Everyone's in a rush to turn tables, what happened to quality?"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Visiting Santa Barbara for the week I knew one of my first stops had to be Eureka. I previously lived there and it had always been a favorite! I walked in about 7:30 and the place was a zoo.  I believe there was a college night or something going on?  After working in the food industry as a server for 8 years I have to say I was worried.  Anyways regardless of the wait my friends and I still decided to eat here.  No more than a minute after we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server vince, or vance? Almost positive it was Vance. Rest assured he gave us a warm welcoming and let us know it was half off wine night (it doesn't get much better than that).  He recommended the brussel sprouts and a glass of Clayhouse the merlot which paired beautifully.  After I ordered the fresno fig burger and took my first bite I instantly remembered why I have always loved Eureka so much.  The food has and continues to be delicious and not only that but more importantly the service is impeccable.  Not once did Vance seem overwhelmed(or at least hid it well) or seem annoyed with our 100 questions about the menu.  Good service goes a long way and for that I wanted to say thank you Vance and thank you Eureka for another wonderful visit."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Maybe the place was just over-hyped by my friends but I don't see what the big deal is. There is usually a wait (I've gone on two different occasions both on evenings). My Wednesday night 6:30 dinner had about a ten minute wait (they can text you so you can go wonder the mall .. definite plus!) and the Friday night dinner for a party of six was about a 30 minute wait. Not unreasonable but they don't take phone reservations so it is what it is.

They usually have a some beer specials. I had the Hoppy Poppy IPA last time I was there and it was a delicious amber colored IPA (just how I like them). I had their basic burger which is delicious (the patty is cooked to your ordering preference between rare - well done). Fries were a little mushy for my taste but my friend's seemed to like them just fine.

I've had the hot wings both times. First time as an appetizer (I was really hungry) and they were maybe a 3.5 out of 10 on the spicy scale. The second time I extra for the extra hot option but I think they forgot to put sauce on the chicken wings because they were not spicy whatsoever. 

I'm giving three stars because it's an okay place with good beer selection and tasty burgers. The time it takes to get a seat however is not really worth it in my book."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"$3-4 hoppy poppy is one of the better deals in town. I really needn't say more, but if im going to ""eat"" something then probably fig burger, watermelon salad, steak salad, nachos... Bloody Mary's are kind of spicy for my taste and moscows too gingery- straying from the hoppy is pretty much just an expensive mistake. 

The cowboy is probably most popular. The watermelon salad is actually pretty filling despite lack of protein because of the quinoa. Sometimes miss the mark on how they cook your burger. I found ""medium well"" gets the results I'm happiest with, ""medium rare"" was ok but too red. Im not the biggest fan of honey on the sweet potato fries I'd prefer a salty offset"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"If you like people watching sit on the patio, great view lol. But the food is very good. I had a French dip sandwich and the waiter brought me a few different sauces to try with my fries. The horseradish one was delicious. I tried their signature punch it was interesting, tasted like herbal tea. The margarita was very yummy it had a strong pineapple flavor. Servers were very nice and the atmosphere was very chill. Never felt rushed."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,every burger at eureka is great but if you are vegetarian do not eat there because their veggie burgers are a weird red and taste like nothing that will ever satisfy you.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Went to Eureka last Sunday for lunch. The wait wasn't bad and our server Nicole got to us pretty quickly. The food came out fast and it was really good. However, once we got our food it seemed like we were abandoned. We tried calling for some drink refills but we were ignored. The worst part was it took 30 minutes for us to pay out and leave. We were honestly shocked that no one took initiative to help us out. All of us would have been okay had one staff member updated us on the situation or problem.It seemed like Nicole was struggling. I was hoping one of the many staff members or a manager could help her out, but I guess not. Overall good food, but service was not so great."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Seven Thumbs up.

It is very exciting when a new place opens downtown, especially for people, like myself, who work downtown.

So i went to Eureka with the work crew, on the 1st day it opened - and was pleasantly surprised. Burgers here are solid, flavors great, quality great, selection great. Cute waitresses? Great! Decor? Bar? Overall vibe? This place will make it. 

My one and only wish for the menu, is that the burgers could come without fries as an option. I guess I could ask...

I, along with my office staff, have become regulars. Nice work"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"What's happening with the service of this rock'n brew pub with killer burgers and one of my top 5 Happy Hours in town? There's ""No crap on tap"" but your service...is. 

The food? Still great. Arguably the best burgers in SB. And their daily Happy Hour beats the vast majority, hands down, with a great price point on snacks and discounted beverages. I still come at 2pm on weekends for a couple'a pints and Ribletts.  But. I'm setting you up for the ""but"".

Many reviews over the years point out a shortage in the service. I did not see that at the bar...until the summer of 2014. What changed, Eureka? I've seen some bar staff move to management and others move on to other bars. The new team, frankly, is no bueno. 
Here are examples (FYI I have 8yrs in restaurant service and more than 15 in customer service. I understand the challenges and the expectations):

* No eye contact: I'm not a patron who waves, whistles or yells out ""Hey buddy!"". Look up and acknowledge me. I may want to order something. It's my money you want. Act like it.

* Clean up: the bar is a mess. As I'm sitting here, I've cleaned my own space, pushing left over plates, glasses and food bits toward and empty space. I did this when I sat down and ordered and now that my food had arrived, the mess is still here. Gross. BTW it was not cleared until my order was removed. 

* Be happy: I don't want to hear you bitch about how slammed you are. As a guest, I don't care about your excuses. Grab your manager out of the office and throw them on the floor, the line or behind the bar. This is not my problem and you should not share it with me. Ever!

Eureka has been fantastic. Don't get me wrong. I don't know if it's a new GM, day manager or Corporate BS and I don't care. Please fix the bar service so I can continue to enjoy my time here. I may not always be around. 

Concerned,
Mark"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Outstanding tonight-management was more than helpful-our server was extraordinary.  Oh yea, the brews and food?  ""10"" out of ""10""...   We are there almost every weekend-being the old folks ordering beers, Brussel sprouts, fries and protein salads...  Kudos to the kitchen staff too, that nobody ever sees....  totally make for a great experience-we'll keep coming back.........."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Loved my server! Amanda made the experience. I'm a vegetarian who reluctantly came to this burger spot with my boyfriend and his crew, not only was there live music and a generally fun atmosphere, but our service was really above and beyond. Per her suggestion i got the quinoa market salad that featured local ingredients and was really satisfying. She was also super friendly and has infectious positive energy, despite how busy it was that evening. I was really pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. (A full bar with craft beer and local wine options didn't hurt either)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Here's the breakdown: decent food, frankly indecent price, and literally the three worst consecutive service experiences I've ever had in my life. I write this review shortly after my third visit to this restaurant/bar. Here are my experiences one at a time:

1st time. I went with a group of (all male) friends and my girlfriend. The waitress, one of those cackling, dumb blonds, with a fake plastic smile, went around the table taking orders and completely skipped my girlfriend (how is that possible? I don't know) and without asking the standard ""is there anything else I can get you guys"" so that we can alert her to the fact that she'd skipped a member of our party, ran off. I had to track her down to get her to come back and take my girlfriend's order. It took her about 3 minutes to find her way back at which point she took the order and was on her way. Now... One would think that if she had placed the separate order 3 minutes after the first then the food from that order would come out about 3 minutes after the first order's food. Wrong... I am sorry to say. All of the gentlemen at the table got their food (I got the slider sampler, can't remember which ones but they were all satisfactory). My girlfriend was polite and told us to go ahead and not to wait, so we ate. More than 10 minutes later (and I daresay we were all but finished eating by then) the girlfriend's food came out. During this whole process there was maybe one ""oops"" but never an apology. You'd think that would be the last time I'd ever go to that restaurant, but I am sad to say, I foolishly gave it a second (and third) shot...

2nd time. I arrived before my friends and had a drink at the bar. The bar tender was nice enough. Nothing special. Friends arrived, we ate. Service, blahhh, food, nothing spectacular. Very pricy for two beers and a burger.

3rd (and final) time. A friend's band was playing here (this being the only reason I'd ever have set foot in the place again). I was waiting at the bar for SOMEONE, ANYONE to pay attention to me. The bar tender near my end, some rude blond woman with absolutely terrible tattoos, was finishing up giving the only other two patrons at my end of the bar their credit cards back and was taking her sweet ass time with it at that. She kept her back to me the whole time. Another bartender made eye contact with me but was busy pouring beer for tables (on a side note, it's sort of frustrating the way that their system works in that when a table places a bar order, a bar tender sees to it and ignores all of the patrons at the bar). So at the time, there was a 1:1 ratio of bartenders to patrons but still no one seemed to notice that I had cash in hand and obviously hadn't been helped. Anyway, the guy made eye contact, no smile, no hello, was too busy, and went on his merry way pouring drinks. Whatever. I look back over at the bar tender who had been helping the gentlemen settle their checks and saw she was now wiping the bar, still keeping her back to me. She went to finalize the credit slips or something. She was clearly doing busy work. Then she tried to walk right past me and head to the other side of the bar. At this point, still no ""hello,"" or ""I'll be with you shortly,"" and my end of the bar was completely cleared out except for myself and this terrible bar tender. It had literally been about five minutes at this point I'd been standing there waiting for her to MAKE EYE CONTACT, say ""hello,"" ""have you been helped?,"" anything but ignore me. I am fed up and as she tried to slink by, nose in the air, to go off somewhere else and neglect some of her other duties, I say, ""Excuse me! Do you work here?!"" Finally,  got her attention. She says, quite rudely, and I quote, ""Yeah. What do you want?"" I place my order (finally) and about 10 minutes after first stepping up to the bar, (finally) have a cold beer in hand. I regret to say that I tipped the standard dollar per drink but immediately after having done so regretted it. I left the tip but hope that this review makes its way to her and the management so that they both know she should be fired.

Quite frankly, all but one of the six people who have ever served me at Eureka should fired. Both from their jobs and then from a cannon into the sun.

At this point, I can assure you all that I will never, ever return to this place and suggest that you all save yourselves the time, money, and effort and do the same.

Thanks for reading."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Pretty decent food but absolutely horrendous service. One of the most disorganized restaurant I've ever been to which is shocking because they are part of a chain.


Hire a manager who has worked at a restaurant before and get it together. Food and drinks delivered to wrong tables and to wrong people at tables consistently. Some of the best burgers in town, but be ready to wait."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great burgers, cool vibe & atmosphere, rare whisky, great beer.  I am very excited about this place!

Went there and ordered green beans for appetizer and Napa burger for entree.  Plus I ate a bit of my friend's Jalapeño and Egg burger-- all amazing!  Plus the had the game on for Sunday Night football, AND they are open until 12am I heard.  Can't wait to try late-night drunk munching ;). 

We were asked by nearly every worker who walked by how we were doing/ how everything tasted-- great customer service.  

I will definitely be back!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The Fig Marmalade burger was sooo good! Also, our server was really attentive and gave us a 40% discount because of long wait for our food (which I didn't think was long at all, they were really busy). Will be back for more!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This place is a favorite within Santa Barbara. What I enjoy about this place is the burgers which ofcourse they're known for. My favorite is either the jalepeno egg burger or the cowboy burger (if you like BBQ). The jalepeno burger has an egg in it!!! They are good for their beers also so it's just a good environment to eat, drink, and watch a game. It's a local favorite. 

I give it four star because it's amazing here and in SB it's definitely the burger to have however it's not the burger to travel for."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I went to this place after there was a big storm in SB. I like the place's open eating area and I got the veggie burger, which was very delicious. The service had many delays and there were many items on the many that weren't available. They told me that, due to power outage of the storm, it had been a chaotic day. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because the burger was good. I will try this place again next time I'm in town and see if their service is better and food options are available."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I had a wonderful experience at eureka this last weekend. Our waitress Tessa? Was hilarious! She ran into the glass door and tripped on a chair but somersaulted out of it without spilling a beer!!! HAHA loved it. Dinner and a show amiright. Anyways food was amazing! The manager who came over to check on us was a little off putting but other than that had a great time!!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This was my first time eating at Eureka and I have one close to home but never really had the urge to try it out. I know they are known for their burgers but I HAD to try the Lobster Tacos! They were really tasty! I knew it would be different, but overall I was really satisfied with it. The sauces in the taco were creamy and very authentic to anything I've tasted. The BF order a burger and it was full of flavors. He enjoyed it along with the coleslaw that was served with it. Now that I had a chance to experience it, I will check out the one close to me so I can try a burger. Service was good and the food was yummy too!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Two words :TRUFFLE FRIES....
If you plan on a night out after you dine here , don't bother , you would probably just stay here and eat truffle fries all night long .( or maybe it's just me )
If you want to distract yourself from texting your ex, swiping your tinder app, studying for an important exam or preparing for an upcoming interview , then you should try truffle fries , I repeat, the fries may not solve your problem but it will certainly keep your occupied because it is that good , like a little piece of heaven ( except it does make you fat and you probably won't be able to pass through the pearl gate after you order like 4 per night ... I definitely did not order 4, just saying ....)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This is one of my favorite places to go and kick it.  I've never had a beer I didn't thoroughly enjoy and their happy hour can't be beat.  $3 hoppy poppy-- yes, please!  My boyfriend and I usually stop in on the weekends in the late afternoon when the apps and drinks are discounted.  Their nachos are special; there is some drizzle of sweet smoke flavor that continues to elude identification, but elevates the plate like no other.  I've tried just about every burger and my favorite would have to be the Fresno Fig-- I'm a sucker for the sweet/savory combo that's been trending.
My current favorite would have to be the steak wrap, though.  It's no less than magnificent!  It feeds me for a whole day, too.  It's enormous so I eat one half for lunch and the other later for dinner.
Look for the Stone Enjoy By beer on tap... Sometimes they have it!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Expensive for what are just, you know, burgers, and not that good ones. I had the original with cheese and fries on the side. My g/f had the Cowboy burger and onion rings.
My burger was so uninteresting I didn't finish it, and the fries were on their way to getting cold and needed salt and way more ketchup than the amount given. As another reviewer suggested, the kitchen must be absolute chaos.
I much preferred the Cowboy Burger, but the onion rings are too big (so you only get three) and flavorless.
Beer selection is good, whiskey selection even better. But I have no desire to come back here when D'Vine is around the corner during the day and the faster food The Habit is a block away."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Can here for lunch with the kids.  The place was relatively happening at 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon.  We were seated right away and given menus.  
Ambience:  Nice open air feel.  There were plenty of TVs to watch any sport games.  It was a tad sunny but there were shades that were lowered to make it perfect.
Service:  This was a pretty big let down.  Initially it started off good.  Orders were taken and drinks brought out right away.  But then, when the food came out, it appeared as if no order was taken...My son asked for cheddar cheese in his burger and there was none.  We asked for only lettuce in his burger and it came with all veggies.  I asked for medium well for his burger and it came out pretty pink.  Ranch on the side was requested and none came out.  Service was pretty much NOT on point.
Food:  Decent.  What was expected from Eueka Burger.  Napa burger was good but kinda messy.  Love the flavor combination.  

Value:  Decent prices.  Good selection of drinks."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"OK so an update. I went back, to give it a second chance. We waited 35 minutes for a Saturday night table, and then we got seated at 'the community table' - very uncomfortable and near the kitchen. Plus the idea of eating with a bunch of strangers didn't appeal. We let the waitress know we were unhappy about it, and the manager came right over and offered us the riblet appetizer to calm us down. Like a Snicker's commercial, I became nicer after feeding. The fig-marmalade burger rocked! Fries were forgettable, but I didn't come for those. The manager made effort to make sure we were ok with the beer sampler, and even got us rare beers we'd asked for but weren't supposed to get. Well, they're on the sampler menu, so why can't we order them? Never got an answer, but the beer was superb - great selection! My boyfriend's Maui Wowie burger was overloaded with pineapple, and soggy, but cooked perfectly. Again the onion rings showed up with no ranch. When they work out some of these bugs, it will be a rocking joint. I have to say I was delighted with my fig marmalade burger. The riblets rocked, as did the beer sampler. The staff is friendly, but not always knowledgeable about the finer details. Keep up the good work, work out the bugs, and you will achieve success in a tough market in Santa Barbara."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"We were excited to try this place but were quickly let down. It's new so the waitstaff is working out kinks...we get it. Nonetheless, waiting 10 minutes to see a waitress is aggravating. Our so-so appetizer arrived after our incorrect order. The beer selection is great but if you're looking for a great burger, go across the street to Habit."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"So heres the low-down: 
It was a Monday night and neither of us felt like cooking dinner. We wanted to try a new place we haven't been before. Eureka! or the place across the street is what the decisions came down too. Burgers + Beer it was so that obviously meant Eureka! was our destination for dinner. 

We were seated right away at a table that was pretty close to others but our neighbors were pleasant. Our server was quick and came by for a drink order. Water to start followed by some sort of Tangerine beer. The beer was bitter BUT good- I could only drink about 1/2 since it was a little to hoppy for my liking. 

Jalapeño Egg Burger....My mouth is watering as I type. This burger is the jam! I opted for onion rings instead of fries and I was very pleased. 3 huge rings (at first I was disappointed since I'm a fatty and really like my onion rings)- these bad boys were filling. 

Thanks for a great meal, friendly and fast service, good beer and a place to watch the game."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Idk what happened here. Eureka used to be a 5-star place, now it's filled with overpriced low-quality food. Happy hour entrees are in no way discounts for what they are. Beers are foamy/warm????? 

What happened??

Management change? 

So confused ‍"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love Eureka, especially their Kale Salad, Happy Hour, Fries and the ambiance is so much fun. They have the best looking servers with wonderful personality. It is a place to go for casual dining experience and located in the Paseo Nuevo it is perfect especially after a movie to walk over there."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"It isn't often that I would walk into a beer and burger joint and not order...a beer and a burger. 

I was welcomed by smiling staff members who sat me quickly...party of one. After scanning the menu I landed on one drink and two apps I had to try: their ""new favorite Greyhound"" with made to order Lollipop Corn Dogs and an order of the ""falling off the bone"" Osso Buco Riblets. 

The drink was amazing. It landed quickly, looked refreshing and tasted better than expected...and I love Greyhounds. 

The apps came out together. The corn dogs had three dipping sauces ranging from sweet to spicy and regular ketchup. The riblets were ridiculous. 

So I finished my apps and ordered a second drink. 

I'll definitely be back to try more. As for today...totally success."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I love their beer selection. Don't get the riblet appetizer.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"excellent, in every way!! 
my good friend brought me here after he's been raving about it for what seemed to me like months. I liked it, i liked it a lot!


We sat outside. Maybe they thought we were on a date or something, since we were both dressed nicely, but I'm glad because it is VERY loud and rambunctious inside. Especially right next to the bar. But think about it: Small-ish restaurant, beer, a game, lots of people having a good time, put that all together and you get a eureka.

Food was really good. Their burgers are super large and in charge. I couldn't finish mine because I was a pansy, so go hungry and leave happy!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Riquísimas las hamburguesas muy bien servicio y muy lindo el lugar bien ubicado. Nos sorprendimos con la calidad de la comida, la verdad de las mejores hamburguesa que probamos en EE.UU. y muy buenos precios. Todo ok."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The service here is awful. My fiancée and I keep coming back because the food is fantastic but I don't understand why the service is so bad. 

The drinks are slow, they hang out by their damn POS computers all the time and only come around if they are bringing food.  We had to beg for water, flag people down to get refills on alcoholic beverages and wait 15 minutes to give our check to the waitress, and it was slow!

This could be the best place in Santa Barbara but the poor front of the house management kills it.  You could get lucky and get someone that takes care of you, but overall this place needs to fix their service."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Went back and of course got the Napa burger again (I mean duh) and this place never disappoints. Love the atmosphere and I have never had a bad burger here... maybe one day ill venture away from the Napa burger but then again maybe nott
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Eureka has been a staple in Santa Barbara for a few years and used to be our go-to downtown spot for its wide selection of drinks and great food. It seems that the quality has greatly deteriorated over time. Service is always slow (even during non-busy hours), I've had bad luck with rude servers (which surprises me since it never used to be a problem!). Food is mediocre at best, and my tables orders are more often than not confused, messed up in some way. It's not bad but there are better places worth your money in town"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Hip little happening place in Paso Nuevo the main shopping center in downtown Santa Barbara... Very lively vibe. The bar was happening and so was the patio outside and the dining room inside!
Hostess was charming and sweet and accommodated us with a lovely 2-top table outside with a heater for my always cold daughter.

Our adorable server Zach was also charming and kind and gave us great service.

Excellent roasted, glazed Brussel sprouts and delicious roasted cauliflower with a phenomenally delicious dipping sauce to start.  
Fantastic blue cheeseburger with a delicious side salad with some kind of citrusy dressing that I loved.  My daughter had a creamy soup & said I t was very good.

Great, spicy bloody Mary's and nice moscow mules.

Definitely want to check this place out!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Second time to Eureka.  Good food.  But horrible service tonight.  Went before a movie .. and after waiting for my meal for 30 minutes I asked them to check on it ... they had lost the order.  Things like this happen - but very poor recovery.   I told them I could not wait to order again due to the movie.  They were nice enough to take the meal off my bill (although acted like they were doing me a favor) - but still charged me for both drinks (to quote ""but I'll still have to charge you for the drinks"").   I wasn't looking for a freebie - but giving me one of my drinks would have a been a very cheap way to really say ""sorry"".  Just didn't feel like they really cared that I was headed out hungry."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We stopped in on our way down the coast on the recommendation of a friend. I must say that, after reading some of the Yelp reviews, I wasn't expecting much. We were quite pleasantly surprised! We live in a town chock full of excellent restaurants that cover the entire range from formal to hole-in-the-wall. Perhaps that is why we thought the prices were quite reasonable.  First off, the entire staff  provided really great service. Polite, attentive, not in your face though. Just what we like. We were seated as soon as we arrived. I don't drink beer and my husband was driving so we passed on something yummy from the bar. The food was spectacular. Fresh, high quality and plated well. They have such a huge variety of burgers and we had a hard time choosing. We settled on a napa valley burger and a beet burger. Awesome! We shared a watermelon salad, because that was something new to us. Amazing! We enjoyed it so much we stopped by again a few days later on our way back and met our kids and grand kids there. Another top notch experience, all the way around. I  hope that someday Eureka will open in Monterey (Carmel won't let a ""chain"") so we can make this a regular stop."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Fries sometimes taste a bit artificial and it can be hit or miss on what temperature they arrive at, but hey, it's a burger joint. 

The burgers are good, although after trying the compete selection I do find some to be a bit too much on the fatty and/or greasy side for my liking. 

However I've grown quite fond of the tortilla burger, which I would definitely recommend."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Been to this chain in Southern California , thought it would be as good , 

But burger bun was old , things full out 

The only reason we went there was because it was open till 11

Will not recommend at all"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka! still has problems: too many servers, and a lot of times things are warm, not hot coming out of the kitchen. 

OTOH, having been through the menu, there's much that is delicious and consistent. Winners: Fresno fig burger, Jalapeño Egg burger, Cowboy burger. A friend tried the bone marrow burger and loved it. Not a fan of: big ol' onion rings (not enough flavor), sweet potato fries too sweet (they have a coating, like you need anything), short-rib ragu is formless.

Happy hours are very good and beer and booze selection tremendous.

But booooooo when they took the Yo Mama's Taco Salad off the menu. WTF guys, I loved that one."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Good food but not worth the bad service and long wait. The hostesses told us it would be about a 45 minute wait, ended up waiting an hour and a half. When there were open tables that they were not concerned with seating anyone at, waitress was much better but overall you can find better restaurants, and tastier food without being ignored."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Came here on a Tuesday with a amazing view of all the empty tables and the bar but yet the sever managed to be slow like it was a Saturday after 6pm and when was there he would ask if we were ready to order and if not he would simply walk away with a smug look on his face. Don't get me wrong I don't expect fake enthusiasm but damn way to make anyone feel totally unwelcome. The food was ok honestly and nothing impressive the chicken nachos were lacking flavor and chicken cause hey you named it that. Honestly the garbage service and ok food won't make me go back anytime soon. I got better service at California pizza kitchen next door which is where I went after the short lived visit.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I went here with a couple friends and my husband for a recent lunch date and the food was amazing. I would especially recommend the truffle fries, the whole table went crazy over them. I had the Kale salad, which was a nice light lunch and my husband had the fish tacos and loved them. Highly recommend this place!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Eureka! Is a great place for a burger (and more.). We had the Napa burger--both with a perfectly cooked beef and veggie patty. Also try the traditional Eureka burger.  Special alert for bourbon fans--great selection of high end whiskies including Van Winkle--sample it while you can--hard to find!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Been here twice after the last review. Last time we ordered the burgers medium and medium rare. Both returned well done. They offered to remake the meet but having already waited for 20 mins to get a table and coming in for a late lunch we didn't  want to wait. I had also asked for ranch....it didn't come until the manager is me over to take care of us, offering me to remake my burger now as they had to correct paddy. I gave my food back, with mostly eaten fries but full burger bc I didn't get the ranch still. They brought back my burger with a medium well paddy and new fries. Offered dessert. Finally brought over ranch and refilled our water. This outing took an hour and a half. We didn't take the dessert. The burger was great! Too full for fries. 4 stars for great customer service after a mess up."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Out of 6 times I have given this place a chance I've had significant fails in my visits. Inexcusable poor service, out of stock of items (salads, chicken, wine) and supplies (ie coasters or cocktail napkins to sop up my overfilled drink, etc) with no substitutions or suggestions made. 

Overall. Shallow service, fraternization and lack of attentiveness toward guests.  

Ethan's chomping on his gum out on the floor, need to close out tickets and keep us waiting to order, and complete disregard is the last straw for me. 

I truly tried. Done."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This place has the most delicious truffle fries, hands down. They are extremely generous with the truffle oil and cheese sauce that they coat the fries in. Came here once just because I was curious about the food and now I find myself coming back all the time! The burgers are fancy and delicious as well, with buns toasted to give that slight crunch :) love this place and definitely coming back more in the future!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Went in on a Sunday afternoon.   Sat at the bar and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  There were three people behind the bar, but they seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves. It wasn't like the place was busy either. Just college-aged young adults who have no sense of customer service.  So I got up and walked out. Food?  Who knows. Service, a big zero.  

The owners should train their staff better."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great burgers! Need to go back after the ""newness"" wears out. Love all the beer selections and the decor."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Napa burger, Cobb salad, taco salad, fish tacos - all delicious! My only suggestion? Get some gluten free beer!  But really, I'm good with their wine selection and I love that they carry great local wines from the Santa Ynez valley.  Service is usually excellent and lots of friendly faces around.  Live music Thursdays, Fridays and maybe more? Definitely has a cool vibe and love sitting on the patio with a glass of wine enjoying some nice music, great food and company."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I am so impressed  with the food and amazing service  here.  The beer and drink selection will make you dizzy.  Had a friend fron Brazil  who wanted the  best hamburgers.  Boy did they impressed.   Dakota did a good job also as our server.   Will be back again.....a must  visit.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I was exited to come here.
Atmosphere was like casual downed hungry cat- ish.
Attractive looking bar as well.

First thing we notice. Silver wear is spotty. Visibly clearly spotty. 
 
Menu. You can tell they are trying topical "" now days"" burger place.

We ordered shrimp poboy sandwich,humberger( can't remember what it was something with blue cheese in it ), lulu buger which is lamb.

In general, it's all bland. Not enough seasoning.
Serving Poboy on chabata - ish bread is probably not so good idea.

Lulu burger, I ordered as medium. Inside was cold. Like fridged cold.
It's not hand shaped patty. Not sure frozen or just mechanically shaped.
But simply not a good burger.

French fly that came with burger was so what ever.
It did seems like fresh cut potato. But not crispy, not hot, not enough seasoning.

Burger was most ok one. barely noticeable amount of blue cheese.
Wasn't bad. But just ok.

So we had 3 entré, 2 wine total of over $60 of what ever burger made us little sad.

I wanted to love this place. 
Unfortunately their food was not even close to what I was expected.
It's just another ok food with big bill restraint."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Love the jalapeño egg burger and pan-seared salmon. Awesome beer selection. Also great atmosphere and wonderful staff.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"We have been to Eureka three times but we won't go back again. Each time the food has been very good but the service has been horrible. Today we waited fifteen minutes just to get our drinks and two out of our four food orders were wrong.  They seem to be doing fine despite the terrible service, so they have little incentive to improve."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Nice place.... Good service !!! The food  fresh!!!! The best think in the restaurant is the hamburger
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Stopped by on my way back to the Bay Area and ordered the mahi mahi tacos, truffle cheese fries, and bruschetta. All of these tasted really good. The only thing I regretted was not ordering a drink to pair, but I had a long drive ahead of me and wanted to play it safe!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I'm surprised this place doesn't have more stars, because it was great! 

We got a booth/table area by the bathrooms (It's not as bad as it sounds). I was happy because I was right in front of a TV, and my boyfriend and I were in our little corner. 

The service was great! I forgot the name of our server, but she was so attentive. 

The food was fantastic for me. I had the watermelon salad, and it was so good! Seriously the best watermelon salad I ever had. However, my boyfriend had the classic burger, and it tasted plain. I told him he should of got one of the special made burgers they had on the menu. In addition, the fries were okay, they tasted like really fried potato chips. 

I loved it here, and if I was to come again by the Santa Barbara area I would stop by here and get the watermelon salad! 

Ps. Prices are very inexpensive"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I know they're everywhere now, but I just don't see myself getting sick of gastropubs.  I have an unlimited tolerance for burgers and beers, and I'm always grateful when there's a new one around.  I have a very picky fiance, so gastropubs are always great fallback dinner options for Saturday nights when we haven't made dinner plans.  This is exactly how we ended up at Eureka! with our friends Tristan C. and Brian G.  We faced a bit of a wait for a table, but otherwise it was pretty hassle-free.

I liked Eureka!  It was conveniently located in downtown Santa Barbara, right in the middle of the busy commercial strip.  There were a lot of people and the atmosphere was fun and bustling, with a little bit of a sports bar vibe.  There was a huge bar, and a huge chalkboard menu listing a nice selection of beer.  We got a table in the middle of the dining room, but we were never crowded.  Service was excellent.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I wish I'd gotten her name because she is a real asset to this restaurant.

The beer list was solid.  I drank a Cismontane Black's Dawn stout and a Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, which I didn't know existed.  Both were great - the stout was a nice heavy coffee stout, and the 120 Minute IPA was strong but almost sweet.  It tasted almost like lychee.  Matt had a Davy Brown ale and the Dogfish Head 90 Minute, which we both like quite a lot.

The food was good, if not especially memorable.  The menu was very big, with a lot of tantalizing souped up options.  I had the Napa Burger, which came with pesto aioli, havarti cheese, fried pancetta, arugula, and an oven-roasted Roma tomato marinated in olive oil and vinegar.  The patty was juicy and decently flavorful, and I liked the gooey cheese and the bacon.  The tomato was not as wonderful as I'd hoped, but it was definitely good.  I also tried some of Matt's Cowboy Burger, which is the most popular one on the menu.  This was pretty tasty, with cheddar cheese, shoestring onion rings, crispy bacon, and homemade beer barbecue sauce.  It was trying less hard than the Napa Burger and it might have been better for it.  The barbecue sauce was excellent.  I got some as a condiment with my side, and it was really hearty and addictive with just the right amount of tang.  The sides were good - we had fat onion rings and some thin fries, both solid, crispy, deeply unhealthy options.

Eureka! isn't a spot I would go out of my way for, but if I lived nearby, I'd probably go pretty often.  We had a great time and the food and beer were both worthwhile.  Chances are good we'll go back in our next couple visits to Santa Barbara."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Tonight my wife said to me the atmosphere is romantic laid back , and it really is I work in the industry so i cut slack often. Tonight though it went overboard, the wings are great our appetizer came out I asked for extra sauce , never got it. Our food came
Out Guacamole on the nachos looked old , My server asked if i wanted a refill , never got it. Food came out he never once stopped by to ask how everything was i never got ketchup for my burger , ill admit the food was good the sweet potato fries are to die for. Its a shame , i asked for a to go box and watched as it never came finally i got up left the food i was very upset , was it because i came with my wife and a baby stroller? Definitely wont be going back anytime soon. For that bad a service ill take my chances and go somewhere else im sorry but the waitstaff needs
To go back to the basics."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Went with the family on a Sunday evening.  We all enjoyed the burgers, and my wife said the vegan one was much better than Mesa Burger's.  The side salad I swapped for the fries was excellent too.  Good fast service.  No complaints."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Just ate here for lunch today! Great food! Great service! Phil was an awesome server friendly and caring. We will definitely be coming back when we're in Santa Barbra again!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Kendall is amazing. First time in way too long that I asked a server for her opinion and she actually had one! She was informative, enthusiastic, and personalized--not at all the generic and indifferent advise I've grown to expect when I go out.

The food was also A+. Had the fig burger, sweet potato fries, side salad (green dressing--¿parsley?-- delicious!), and chicken tacos and every last thing was excellent. Everything except the chicken tacos exceeded expectations big-time, and the tacos were still good too.

I shared all this with my boyfriend and we both left satisfied for under $25 (before tip). Boom.

Open one in LA and I'll be a regular."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,So good!! The bruschetta appetizer with goat cheese rocked my socks off and the tortilla burger is one of the best burgers I have had in Santa Barbara!  My friend had the Cowboy burger and equally enjoyed it. Great beer selection although I wish they had more hefweizen because that is my favorite. Service was impeccable. I highly recommend checking this place out if you are in Santa Barbara!! All around great!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great experience.   Ultra accommodating to our needs given that we came with our 1 year old, food was great and the beer selection is on point.  

The server even took care of my wife with a bday sundae out of the blue.  

We'll be back the next time we're in town for sure!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Love the veggie burger (beet & kidney beans) & the quinoa watermelon salad!....and they have cider on tap!! Only complaint is that the sweet potato fries come drizzled in some sort of cinnamon buttery oil which I was not into, I asked waiter if I could switch, he said ok, took my fries away - he gave us a huge plate of regular fries (which are awesome), but when the bill came, I discovered that not only was I charged $2 extra for the sweet potato fries (which I ordered so that wasn't horrible) but they took them away when I immediately asked for the switch, and I ended up paying for the plain fries also- another $4 I think... it was a good size plate (probably a side or appetizer) but I didn't want to complain and be that person and the waiter was rushing around , so I just paid, but it still kind of sucks. I think they should definitely mention on the menu and to patrons who order the sweet potato fries that they come topped with cinnamon, sugary, butter- because with a burger, it's kind of strange- but to each his own- I just prefer to be informed and get what I'd like w/o paying an extra $6, but the pros outweigh the cons and I'll definitely be back- just be forewarned, sweet potato fries come with cinnamon, buttery drizzle"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Being new to the area, I've explored different types of places for food, drinks and entertainment.  Somehow, I find myself gravitating back to Eureka.  The Santa Barbara location is as good as it gets in the area for multiple reasons.  The food selection is diverse, yet simple enough to sort through for a quick and casual meal.  Their burgers, of course, being their hallmark; try their fish tacos.  I've yet to grow tired of them-they're fresh, definitely full of flavor, and resonably priced.  But you won't be able to go wrong anywhere on their happy hour menu, so try everything at least once.  If you sign in for a table and there's a short wait, be patient; it will be worth it.

The over 30 beer selections available represent the best of every variety brewed in the western U.S.  Try testing your bartender by letting them know what you like, and I guarantee they can offer you 2 or 3 terrific selections that will make it difficult to decide on just one!  It's not just about being able to brew your own.

One thing that keeps me coming back is the staff from top to bottom.  The bartenders are friendly, respectful, and true beer geeks.  And with their rotation of brews, they really do keep up with the best beers in the area.  The place is managed extremely well;  I've met the management staff and it's evident they truly care about their customers, about service, and about the food quality.  We've all been to places that lack good management, and it shows.  This place is a well-oiled machine.  Every staff member I've been in contact with has demonstrated true hospitality.  Whether an afternoon lunch, or dinner time, I have really felt comfortable here with every visit."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Thank you for the great bread pudding French toast . It was great my daughters and I went there on Sunday  and I had no idea, they have brunch so I tried their bread pudding French toast and I really enjoyed it"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Wife's kale salad was good, but chicken breast sandwich was chunks of poor quality white and dark meat. The service was not good either. Hopefully the burgers are better, but we probably won't be back to Eureka!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The beer selection is solid, the environment is loud but classy, the service is quick and efficient, and always friendly but...The burgers here are life changing. My personal favorite is the Pearl Street Blues Burger because I love all things with bacon blue cheese and mushrooms but they have some very interesting culinary adventures made burger like the Fresno Fig Burger that actually has a nice fig jam on it. Not only the amazing quality burgers but it actually has restaurant type food as well which is equally awesome. The food is also fundamentally sound in addition to the preparation and execution, the meat is all grass fed and free range and  for those who like the veggie things, there are a tasty salads and gluten free options for those who are so inclined. There is truly no downside here. Aside from my being appallingly addicted to this restaurant on a college student budget. Not that the price is bad, quite the contrary, I find it very agreeable. Moreover I keep trying to go back everyday of the week."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,so I decided to see what the fuzz was about in this restaurant thar it was always busy. I decided to go and to start with it was very crowded but with waiters. One of them kept hitting my table with her pitcher. The food was terrible. I ordered a maui wowi Burger hoping it would be delicious and well habits Hawaii burger was BETTER. The meat was tasteless. Looks like they make more money on the bar area. Definitely will not be coming back.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Good burgers. Very good beer selection. The portions have gotten smaller and they dropped the lamb burger. They need to go back to the beginning
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Went this weekend, and I feel like this place could be really good, but it just doesn't quite reach that level. 

To drink, we had a Bloody Mary and a beer flight, in which we told the waitress to pick for us. The Bloody Mary was okay. I feel like if you're going to have a piece of bacon, make it crispy! Otherwise you have a cold piece of pork fat chilling in your drink. The flight was BAD. It felt like she used our ""pick for us"" as a way to get rid of beer no one was drinking, because we didn't like ANY of them. Or they need better beers? I wouldn't know. 

The burgers were super rich: it tastes like they cook their burgers with loads of butter, which is a little overwhelming. I felt myself get a little sick by how rich my Napa burger was. 

THE GOOD:

-espresso chocolate cake with ice cream: SO GOOD. We cleaned that dish with our FACES. 

- osso bucco ribs: DELCIOUS. I'm not sure how close to osso bucco it actually was, but it definitely was tasty. Probably the best thing we ate. I wish I had just ordered this for dinner. 

Overall, I feel like if they clean up the excess fat on those burgers and they get better beers, they'd be in good shape."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"If you come to Eureka, ask for Tyler. One of the most kind hearted, funny, amazing servers I have ever had. Definitely had a smile on my face the entire time. YAY TYLER."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Can't beat the happy hour appetizers! Go for the bruschetta and lollipop corn dogs but the osso buco riblets and truffle fries are also delicious. My favorite burger is the fig burger topped with goat cheese, diced tomato, arugula, and a fig jam. Also good for craft beers and whiskies. This is a kinda loud place FYI"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The beers and spirits are good along with the fries and onion rings. The customer service lacks, takes forever to get condiments, if they ever arrive. Beyond that not much else worth trying. I don't recommend to friends or out of towners."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka is the best. Me and my friends come here almost once a week. The jalapeño egg burger and the chicken nachos are delicious.The service is also great, our usual server darby is so friendly and always makes sure everything is good. 10/10 would recommend this place for breakfast lunch or dinner."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great burgers, great beer, great service! Especially the little blonde waitress, Stephanie, whose bubbly personality and warm demeanor was a true treat! I will definitely be coming back to this establishment for beer, burgers, and blondes. ;)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The place struck me as a chain restaurant, and I didn't know what to expect out of the food, so I was surprised with the fig burger.  Paired with bacon, it's a surprisingly good combo!  

I tried to strike a healthy(ish) balance with broccolini.  Not recommended - hardly anything was done to it.  The portions of french fries are also too small - more healthy(ish) balancing on their part?

It seems like service is hit-or-miss and was a clear miss on this day.  After trying for quite a while to catch the attention of any waiter in eyesight from our outdoor table until one clearly not assigned to us had to intervene on our behalf, we were served by no less than four or five different people throughout the night.  I'm not sure if this is an intentional system on their part, but let's consider it a failed experiment? The wait to pick up the check was also substantial.

Their beer selection is good, but overall, you might do better going to one of the local fast-food stands unless you're really looking for a restaurant atmosphere."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I split the Cowboy Burger with fries with a friend and we also got the onion rings. This place rocks. Everything was so good. I don't generally get excited over burgers because they're really hard to mess up, but once in a while you have one that stands out. This was it.  I asked for the BBQ sauce that the burger comes with on the side because I'm particular about where I put BBQ sauce and I found this burger was better without it. But that's just a matter of taste.  The onion rings are the super wide onion kind, they're serious onions, like the kind you use a fork and knife with.  They were good and so were the fries. 

We were seated immediately and our young college boy servers were attentive - perhaps a bit too attentive.  We felt like we were getting interrupted a lot for silly questions and check-ins on how we were doing. Also, one guy grabbed a plate while my friend's hand was on it picking up fries and dipping them in the ketchup - he's grabbing it asking her if she's done when she's clearly still eating.  Hello!  

This place got really busy, so it's clear it's a favorite."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"It's hard to find a good Old Fashioned. This place serves up a very good one! Most bars will serve up the Old Fashioned with several ice cubes, poor ratio of ingredients, and somehow ruin a fairly simple drink. I would go back to Eureka just for this drink alone. If you're a whisky snob, check this place out and they won't disappoint. 

As for the burgers, yeah... they hit the spot. Their prices are somewhat slightly higher than say, a Red Robin... but the extra couple bucks you're paying is well worth it. The Napa burger was delicious with the pesto aioli it has on it.. it never disappoints. The Pearl Street Blues burger was OK... but I would probably ask for extra blue cheese next time. It didn't seem ""blue cheesy"" enough for me. When I order something with blue cheese, I want to be hit with that pungent blue goodness! These burgers though, for $11-13? You cannot beat that, especially with the flavor you get in return on that investment.

Old Fashioned done right, and a flavorful burger? Yep, it's a keeper!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"One of the worst spots in Santa Barbara. After eating dinner there last night I got very sick, was throwing up for hours. This isn't the first time this has happened to me after eating here. Not sure what's going on in the kitchen but I was very disappointed with the food."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"2 friends & I took a lunch break while we were shopping at Paseo Nuevo today. The place was packed, we were told the wait would be about 15 minutes & they took my cell #. They have a cool way to notify you to ""get your buns over"" . Our table was ready in less than 10 minutes! 
Alexie was our server & he did a great job helping me pick out something not too BIG... Fresh blackened mahi mahi tacos with cabbage & mango salsa... Outstanding!! My friends split one of their delicious burgers. The beef is fresh& cooked perfectly to order! We think they have the best burgers ever!
After we finished eating, Moses, the Manager came over to ask us how everything was... Of course we told him how great everything was! 
The only down side is, the acoustics are not good for conversation. It is really noisy... But not a big deterrent because we were there to eat!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This place was recommended to be by a friend, so I passed by as I was driving back up to NorCal. Our waitress recommended almost everything on the menu so it was hard to decide what to eat. But after looking at all the pictures on Yelp, I had to get the riblets! I also ordered their alfredo mac n cheese. Both were delicious, and the portion sizes were perfect. If you're ever coming down to SoCal, give this a try. Love the ambiance of this place, and the service was excellent."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The portions are on the smaller side, but its with out a doubt deliciously made.

I thought the burger was made to, near, perfection. The portion of the fries were very small but it's not a big deal.

The crowd is is very diverse and it's a cool location, but when they get very busy, it feels as if they want you to eat, and leave as soon as possible.

The beer selection is pretty good, but not out of this world; and they only serve pints."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great burger and good spot behind State street make this a fine place. Attention from the bartender was weak in that they were not proactive to offer eating utensils, napkin, refills, or check if I'm enjoying my meal. Maybe a table would've been better."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Amazing service and delicious food! I had a very good time with my friend for a quick evening dinner.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Totally the best Happy Hour in SB! Loved my bartender Monica Monday! She recommend the best beer to pair with my dinner! She changed me from a vine lover to a grain loving  romance! Friendly, fun, informative crew to make you feel like you're family! The ""Cheers"" of SB!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The food was good but very disappointing service.

We arrived (a group of 3) and we were actually seated pretty quickly but when I say down in my chair I realized it was soaking wet, along with the floor which I had to wipe up with my own napkin (and jeans). We somehow managed to have two servers both pestering us while we were clearly still mulling over the menu. The drinks were a little late and the food took forever to arrive.

We finished our drinks about 5 minutes into our meal and they were never refilled. My boyfriend pre-ordered another beer which the waitress said would be brought out once his was halfway finished and we never got that either. Once our food arrived we didn't hear from another server until we asked for our check, after waiting about 30 minutes with empy plates and drinks.

Extremely disappointing escpially since I've been here before and we had great service!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Amazing experience this Valentine's Day!!
3 friends and I went after work since they close until 12. We had 2 beers, 3 appetizers, and 2 desserts, they were all amazing!!! The best part was the detailed and personal attention the staff, especially the assistant kitchen manager Mauro Lopez gave us. He brought the appetizers and desserts to our table in such an energetic way. His charismatic and friendly attitude was charming and welcoming. It's so nice to see someone so passionate and committed to his job. Highly Recommend this place to anyone wanting to eat good food and drinks!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,I wish I could give thus place a higher. I wanted to like it but neither my husband nor I did. We went on a Sunday afternoon. The hostess was not friendly. The server spilled water on my feet & didn't even apologize. We ordered our burgers & waited & waited. It took about 40 mins. The burgers were okay at best. I had the Napa & my husband had the Cowboy.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I'm somewhere between good and a fan.  I do really like their food, it feels very fresh and healthy - what I order, but you can also order big messy burgers and fries.  I like to order my burger Naked.  That always get's me good sevice!! '-)  The burger naked is served on a bed of arugella so there's no bun - no carbs! My favorite side is off the menu, I order watermelon spears and balsamic reduction! 
The downs on this place for me is that it is very loud, loud music, no way for the sounds to be absorbed with the many  hard surfaces and high cieling. 
The first few times we went here the service was poor, but they were new then and later visits provided better service. 

When we are in Santa Barbara, which we often are I like coming here!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Went there yesterday for the first time and really enjoyed it. The food was great. The manager (I believe his name was John) was very friendly and went out of his way to greet us even though he wasn't our server. Had an overall enjoyable experience.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Service was incredibly slow and not attentive and it took forever to get our food. I got the Mac and cheese balls and they were just ok, the chili's in them take away from the taste completely. Honey on the sweet potato fries was a nice touch and the restaurant has a good atmosphere."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"This place is terrible.  Service is so spotty, the only reason it is still open is because tourist don't know any better.  They ""close"" whenever they feel like it and not according to the hours posted on their site.  Even when they do decide to be open, they are incredibly inconsistent and the staff have vacant over worked stares.  Go to The Habit Burger, don't waste your time"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Literally all of their burgers are amazing. They come out a little on the rare side, so keep that in mind when you order. The fig burger is my favorite; the savoriness of the goat cheese and bacon with the sweetness of the fig marmalade. OMG. And their beer selection is on point too."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I came here recently for dinner on a weeknight with some co-workers. It was my first Eureka experience and it was a pleasant one. I ordered the veggie beet burger and thought it was fairly tasty, though to be honest I can cook a yummier beet burger myself. But I was just thankful there was something vegan-friendly to order here! I would recommend making the patty firmer as it fell apart too easily. Perhaps the addition of flax or breadcrumbs would do the trick. It could have used more flavoring where vegenaise or maybe a hummus or tahini dip would have worked well. 

The service was good, nothing to complain about! We had a friendly and accommodating server who was nice enough to give us all separate checks. He was efficient at taking our orders and prompt in bringing them out. It was a busy night so kudos to him!

I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return but if my co-workers invite me again I'll go!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"My favorite place! Great food, great beer selection, and great happy hour! Dollar off pints and pretty good app deals too. They consistently rotate about 15 beers and you can always try something new when you stop in. Not the best place for viewing sporting events with a group of people, as the bar area is pretty limited. But great burgers, great beer, and great apps. Oh yea, did I mention the whiskey too?"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Hamburgers aren't the same anymore. .they taste like sawdust added to the meat ..the end of a great burger oh well another one bites
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I have dined at this location several times and love the atmosphere! My favorite burger is the Fresno Fig Burger and you must go there for ""Hoppy Hour""! They have $2 off the beers and great deals on appetizers. I have had the same servers several times, I think it's Danielle and Kelly? They are great! The staff is energetic and welcoming. Definitely check out Eureka Santa Barbara!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,I've been wanting to check this place out since it opened and really was expecting more. The service was TERRIBLE! Their fire hot wings barely touched mild let alone hot and they are tiny. As for the burger it was small as well. The only thing this place has going for it is their beer selection but even that is over priced. I don't plan on ever going back.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Your typical burger and fries restaurant. The food is decently priced, between $10-$20. The service is deplorable, and has been every single time I go."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Update to my first review: I'm happy to have good news!

The boyfriend and I returned to give Eureka! a second go and had an excellent experience. We arrived at 12 noon on a Sunday and just beat the crazy lunch rush by about 10 minutes. We had the Pearl Street Blues Burger (cooked medium rare as requested) and a kale salad. Both were delicious and our server (wish I could remember her name) was sweet, fun and very attentive.

We returned a third time to verify we really did like Eureka!, this time bringing a friend who happens to be a little bit of a difficult customer. We ordered many appetizers off the HH menu and some beers. We experienced good service and consistently tasty food.

We will be back!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Their burger with goat cheese and fig jam was AWESOME.
Outdoor patio area was adorable... and bearable with heat lamps.

Their HH is good - and comes back after 9:00 PM!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Great place! The staff is always super friendly and the food is always delicious! I came in here after having a horrible experience at pascussi and it was the best choice I had made all day !
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Yum!! Wonderful food & drinks! Fun atmosphere too. I love that it's located right in the middle of state street with lots of shopping near too! Service has always been good, no complaints."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I have quickly become a regular at eureka in the last three months. The menu is fun and offers quite a few options. You cannot beat their happy hour, aptly named ""Hoppy Hour"". It runs from 9p- close every single day! 

I love to stop by because I'm a late night eater when I get off work around 10 or 11. 

Tonight, my service was just plain awful. An experience I don't usually have! My food came out cold, lacking the ingredients I specifically asked to be added, I asked for a water and didn't get it until after I was halfway through my meal.... Even more, I was sitting in the cushioned banquettes on the far side of the bar and never had a server!! Usually one comes around quick but tonight, I sit here writing this as I finish up my ENTRÉE and still havent met whoever I am supposed to pay. At this point I could easily walk out and no one would be the wiser!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Another one of my favorite spots downtown. 

The burgers are amazing and they have very unique flavors to them. Easily two of my favorites are the bone marrow burger which will make you salivate just thinking about it, and the fig burger, a cheaper but excellent option. 
My girlfriend loves their salads as well and is always down to go. 

Great selection of beers at decent prices, especially when the ""hoppy hour"" rolls around after 9pm. One killer deal they have is $3 pints of Figueroa mountain's hoppy poppy all day! A very good local IPA.  You can't even get that deal at fig mtn brewery!

I have had great service the majority of the time, but have definitely had some times where the service was awful and  once when the manager was rude. It was likely due to poor communication between staff. Left a very bad taste in my mouth. This experience dropped a star for me. 

Other than that, great food at decent prices. I recommend this place to any burger/beer lover."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Good burger, Great beer selection. 

I just moved to SB and this place has the best craft beer selection in town. A lot of local staples and plenty of beers from some of the best breweries up and down the west coast. I would personally recommend the Beer Sampler as it allows you to try tasting portions of 4 beers!

Service staff was energetic and friendly despite being extremely busy.

If you are a beer person, this is the place to go in SB!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Great burgers and beer. I have been here a few times with my wife and friends always a good experience
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Three of us went for dinner on Saturday.  The place was crowded, but we only had to wait for 10 mins.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  Burgers are gourmet and were cooked perfectly and the sweet potatoe fries are delicious!  Can't wait to go back again!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I have now given this place TWO chances to impress. Sadly, both times I was disappointed. Both times I ordered an appetizer that never came. The service is not that great, having been a server for 7 + years in the past I don't understand their system. They have a ""hostess"" seat you. Another person takes your drink order. Another person takes your food order. Another person brings you food and check. Both times I have been here our meal order came fairly quick, but without the appetizer. I did not say anything, thinking that maybe it was just a simple mistake and that it would eventually come. Never got my appetizers. I would have told a staff member if someone had checked on us to even see if our food was ok, but that didn't happen either. Once we got our food, it was like we were ignored until we showed signs that we were done and ready for the bill. I am used to staff checking in to make sure the meal is good and satifactory....this place doesn't do that. I felt like I had to flag down a staff member to just get my bill. Again, yes I should have said something to the staff but I was just over it. I was not charged for the appetizer that never came, both times....so I just dropped it, paid and left. 
There was never an offer for a drink refill or for additional orders or for desert. The atmosphere is good, very Santa Barbara and trendy...but service is lacking. Food is decent, and a little pricey but that's Santa Barbara for ya. Overall really not impressed."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Good family spot. Great ambience. Food was good. Service was a little slow for it not being that busy. I would come back.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I had to make a Yelp just to say how great of an experience I had at Eureka. It was our first time here and we will definitely be coming back. We got seated fairly quick into one of the booths for a party of six. Our server had such a refreshing smile and was very attentive to our needs. She brought us drinks even while some of us were using the bathroom and she even brought out some avocado and watermelon for our little one while we tried to figure out what we wanted to eat. Our food was delicious, Stephanie made amazing recommendations and spent a good amount of time accommodating our questions. I had the fig burger but without the goat cheese and with her recommended sweet potato fries. So delicious!! For a first experience Stephanie made it so incredible and we will definitely come back to see her and of course for the food!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Absolutely amazing burgers.  If you are here with at least one other person, start your meal off with the truffle fries! They are to die for--I still think of them to this day.  They have a large selection of beers with many of them being special brews that are rotated out.  Ask the waiter or waitress for a sample if you want to taste some of the beers.  The service was a bit slow our night (busy night, so it's understandable) but our food was stellar and our waiter was great.  Truffle fries!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The food is good but the service is so incredibly ""hit or miss"". It is very frustrating!  Food not worth the frustration:("
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I came here during happy hour, and one time when it was not happy hour, and concluded this place is really great, if you come for happy hour. The food is pretty good and has reasonable prices during happy hour, that I probably wouldn't pay full price for."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Beer selection is great. Food is OK. I much prefer American Ale, but Eureka offers a bigger menu, which some prefer.

I do very much enjoy their Cobb salad, which is wonderfully unhealthy. It's about 30% bacon and 20% cheese, grilled chicken and an egg are also involved. There are some greens for decoration. I had it today with mustard vinaigrette on the side, which is a very tasty (sweet, thicker than traditional vinaigrette)."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I came here for a quick bite on a Sunday, it wasn't too busy and the service was fast! I am vegetarian so I had the truffle fries, veggie burger and mac and cheese bites, which it was all fine just nothing wow! Reminds me of the vibe at BJs, I would come again for a quick bite."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Perfect experience! The place was packed! They really did a great job remolding this building, it's so open and inviting, just a fun place.  We sat at the bar and Aaron the bartender was amazing, he told us all about the 30-40 beers on tap along with the walls full of whiskeys.  It's nice to have a bartender that knows his stuff and you get to learn something interesting! We had the Fig Burger which was DELICIOUS and the bruschetta because I am a bruschetta fan and I can promise you, this was the best bruschetta I've had in SB so far! Looking forward to trying more burgers.  We both tried 2 new craft beers to go along with our dinners (very cheap considering SB prices). Our whole experience was perfect and to top it off, the manager, Moses, came over to say hello and he was so nice, just genuinely cared about the restaurant and our experience. He is going to make sure this place succeeds.  I think this place went off without a hitch and I'm excited to have Eureka in SB, just what we needed!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I work at a company that is half a block away from Eureka burger. We called early to get reservations for seven of us, but was told that they would not take reservations for any size party.
So we showed up for lunch early, the restaurant was empty, yet they wouldn't Seat us because the one table in the restaurant that could accommodate seven people was taken.
I spoke to the manager, and she refused to push tables together as ""it's a fire hazard"".
I have never been to a restaurant they could not push tables together to accommodate diners.
Absolutely ridiculous.
I hope that the owners of the restaurant read this as I'm sure they would be super pissed off.
We ended up going to Esau's just across the street who have no problem pushing tables together to accommodate us, and the food was delicious.

Please notice that all of the one star rated reviews are shown on yelp as ""not recommended "". I guess this is a benefit of being a paying customer for yelp.

I imagine this review will end up as ""not recommended"""
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Our server Edrick made the evening very enjoyable. The staff was gracious, the corndogs amazing and a huge variety of alcohol. Highly recommend."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This is probably my favorite place in town. The All-American food is a must have in the beach town in Santa Barbara. 

Food exceeded my expectations and the presentation is 5/5 stars. We got the bone marrow burger as everyone suggests, and the amount of juiciness and tenderness is out of this world.... these words cannot express how well made this burger was unless you try it. I asked what the waiter suggests for beer that goes well with the burger and his suggestion of the stout to counteract the burger made this burger perfect.

You may want to try getting the $9 sampler if you want to try different beer tastes, but believe me, the stout makes the perfect combination.

Every time I come here I NEED to get the truffle fries. The fries are well done, and covered with cheese. The truffle dip is what makes it ponderous. You get mixed into the creamy sauce that you forgot you're paying $9 for this plate of fries. You should know however that if you're there between 3-6 or after 9, it's $6. If you haven't had the truffle fries or the bone marrow burger, I can no doubt say you have not visited Santa Barbara."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"It was my friends birthday weekend and I was in Santa Barbara to celebrate with her. So as always we were deciding what to eat, for the past couple of meals I had, I had sandwiches/burgers. Which I did not enjoy because I had a subway sandwich from Union Station back in LA and it was HORRIBLE. But thats a whole different yelp review later on! Haha.

I tried checking in and unlocking the free appetizer, I was sooo excited because I wanted the Mac n Cheese, I mean how DELICIOUS does that sound? DELICIOUS! But once I tried checking in, there was all this complicated stuff, like You buy one appetizer, you get one FREE, AFTER 9PM.. I was like... what? It just said ""FREE APPETIZER"" But I gotta go through all that? No thanks.

Anyways, we decided to get Eureka! It sounded so cute, and I was like yey! Lets go! We were seated within the 5 minutes we got there, and all the waiters kinda looked alike to me with their hair styles, with the combover/cut look. I was like whoa.. Haha, but we had a server that was different. 

I didn't know what I wanted but I kinda wanted the Fig Marmalade but I decided to go with the Pearl Street Blue Burger because I lalalalooove sauteed mushrooms on my burger! I also wanted a salad because I really wasn't craving fries. I looked at the menu again and I was astonished on how they charge 1.50 to substitute. Like, REALLLLLY? 1.50?! For a salad?! Ugh. I mean, come on, if it was like at least 1.00 I would've thrown less of a fit there, but the 1.50 wasn't cutting it for me so I just stuck with the fries.

The burger was good, I wouldn't say the best, because I prefer burgers that I create myself, like The Counter or 50/50s. But this burger was decent. The fries were good, It just hit the spot because I didn't have breakfast before and such.

The service was decent as well. Our server didn't really interact with us much, he just got to the point. I felt like he didn't smile either too. The only server that smile was one of the guys who served our food, I swore he smiled at me only. hehe. 

But overall, my experience here was ok. I wouldn't pay 10 dollars for a medium size burger. 

2 stars just because the 1.50 substitution off guard! 

Have fun and Good luck!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Food is good. Service just ok. But please bring back the onion rings!! They are what make you stand out from other burger places. And what is up with their being no salt and pepper on the tables?? I absolutely HATE restaurants that do that. I shouldn't have to ask for salt at a place that serves burgers and fries. Ironic that you DO have sugar packets on the tables. Do you really sell more iced tea than burgers and fries?? Each table should have a salt shaker.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Just happened to walk by and there was a lot of people and a fun atmosphere. We were seated quickly by very friendly staff. The food is excellent and innovative. Pop rocks on a roasted beet salad and fired egg on a chipotle burger are really fun and tasty. Don't miss the sweet potato fries drizzled with honey and cinnamon!!!
I recommend this one highly for a nice late lunch or early dinner. You will be satisfied!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Bottom line: this place started out strong and has slipped quite a bit.

     If you're going to charge $28 for two burgers, it had better be good.  In all fairness our meal today wasn't bad, but it wasn't $28 before tip good.
        The burgers were good but over cooked and the fries and onion rings were wildly under cooked....like soggy and white under cooked - not crispy golden brown.
    The food was slow to come out but they were fairly busy.  the service was very good and we tipped well but post tip, we were not super pleased.
     I'm the last person that's going to complain about an expensive burger they're killin' it - but today's burgers were certainly not killing anything..."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The food here is great, some of the best burgers I've tasted. Though they have the worst service I've encountered. I come here frequently, and there has not been an instance where the server does not forget to deliver an item that we have ordered. Waiting for the day where everything we order actually comes out. You can expect good food, but most likely you won't get everything you ordered. Make sure to remind your server."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"As a regular at Eureka I find it hard to say anything bad! The atmosphere, food, and drinks are one of a kind. I order pretty much the same thing every time I go, jalapeno egg burger. Perfect ""breakfast burger"" to go along with the BEST bloody mary's I've ever had. The only bad thing about them is they're served only Saturday and Sunday! The music is low but the variety is great and really adds to the environment. The servers are always super friendly, and the bar staff are always extremely personable! Eureka is great for just about any situation. A Friday night spot, date night, or even football Sunday! If you haven't been to Eureka, GO NOW, seriously what are you waiting for?"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"So, not my 1st time at Eureka but my 1st time at this restaurant.  Walked in and the server took 10 minutes to acknowledge us after being seated although the place was fairly empty and the servers were just talking amongst themselves not paying attention to anyone except maybe the rogue pigeon and the pregnant manager.  I had asked 2 different servers for salt never got it until I asked the manager which then proceeded to roll her eyes after my request and I was walking away... sigh, sorry Eureka! You are no where close to the excellent service I receive in Irvine.  My server I think was new, appetizers and were mediocre at best.  Never come here again... too bad."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Can't go wrong ordering anything here, the food is to die for!
High quality service, very clean, and welcoming staff.
Will definitely be coming back when I am in town again."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Both times great food and beer. Burgers are phenomenal but not big at all :( beers are flavorful!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Went for lunch yesterday, place was packed. Had the bison burger which was excellent. Mom had the kale salad which she liked very much. Our server was very friendly and accommodating. Really enjoyed our meal and will be back. Great beer selection too!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I came to Eureka originally intending to try their veggie burger, as I am on a quest to find the best one in town.  I called ahead to ask if the burger was vegan and was informed that it was, but when I double checked with my server she said it wasn't.  Seems to be some miscommunication there.  To play it safe I got the falafel tacos and I'm so glad I did!  They came in lettuce cups and were super fresh and beautiful with a really delicious kale slaw.  The fries were kind of cold and meh, but I wasn't that interested in them anyway.  Kind of pricey but I liked the creative menu options!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I was surprised on how low the reviews are here. Every time I have been here, it's been very pleasant.  This time my server was Zach (blondie...not the one behind the bar). He was really friendly, had great suggestions on food (we came for happy hour), and  got my pup water and treats as needed. He was very prompt on service. Although our drinks did come out after our food. We ordered hoppy poppy for beer. Appetizers we got cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, and nachos. Small portions but definitely worth it for only $6 each. Plus they tasted delicious. I definitely think eureka needs to hire more people like Zach. Great service!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I have had a high quality experience both times I have had dinner at Eureka. Friendly staff. and good food. the cobb salad is great! Plus its one of the few nice places that stay open late in Santa Barbara, as it is a small town. A wonderful new addition the Santa barbara food scene."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Brief Summary: Eureka (in any of their locations) is a great place for burger lovers that have a little more taste than simple fast food fare. They have a nice selection of burgers and other fleshy proteins, and their list of whiskeys and cocktails is notable. For vegetarians (lacto-, pesc-, or ovo-) the amount of food options are still pretty solid as well with dairy/fish/egg options.

Full Review: I've been to a few Eureka! locations, all of them good. Their ingredient quality and palette is definitely much higher than standard burger restaurants, and while that makes it more pricey, I feel its justified.Their menu has a handful of topping styles as well as decent salads and non burger sandwiches.

In regards to the SB location, it did a fine job. No wait time to be seated, staff were helpful even in the busy lunch hour, the restaurant was clean, and the food didn't take a huge amount of time.

Personally I went the veggie route that day and chose the basic Veggie Beet Burger option with arugula and a lemon vinaigrette and really enjoyed it. The burger itself was filling and satisfying without feeling too heavy and is probably reasonable in the protein department, topped with a commendable amount of arugula and not too much dressing. Unfortunately no whole wheat bun options, but flavor wise  it was soft and pleasant. While the burger pretty much did it for me, I had also gotten the grilled seasonal vegetables on the side, and the few bites I had of them were flavorful and actually in season (what a concept).

Eureka!, while obviously geared more to omnivores, is still a fair quality restaurant chain that does offers good vegetarian options as well."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Surprised to see the GM sit down at the bar for almost an hour. Other managers on were involved with helping staff as well as guests. Staff was excellent.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Beware, this place is very slow.  Came here on a business trip with my superiors.  Servers took forever to take our first drink order and appetizer order.  For our second drink order they messed up the order.  We ended up getting the check without ordering food because it took so long.  2 stars, don't recommended.  Go to Hoffman Brat House instead."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Wow!! So good!! We had the cowboy burger, the tortilla burger, Caesar salad, chicken wings and truffle fries. Omg!!! Every thing was really delicious, service was speedy and quite attentive. No complaints whatsoever!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The food was great. It was the service that was so awful. Our waiter never came to check up on us and we had to ask him three times to bring waters to our table. He forgot to bring our drinks as well, but didn't forget to charge us for them? He couldn't answer any of the questions we asked him about the menu. Wouldn't recommend going there if you're in a hurry..."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I like Eureka. They have amazing burgers. 
I was happy the time I saw burger with fried egg because I remember my country, it's very common to have burgers with fried egg. Therefore, I enjoy that here. 
There are many things are hood for appetizer. You can get mouthwatering wings especially with buffalo sauce, and you can get mac n cheese, when you'll eat it, you'll say wow delicious. 
I like to eat tortilla burger without bacon, and with fried egg, or sometimes, I like to eat jalapeño egg burger. 
Tortilla burger is burger, jalapeño, bacon, kinda of cheese or sauce. 
My friend usually like to get cowboy burger. It delicious but I cannot eat it coz I'll get messy with it, but she work with it so fine. 
You can have fries ( good ), onion rings ( kinda big ), and other staff, but I like these two for the side. 
I don't drink, but my friends told me their beer is very good, and if you beer drinker, you'll like their beer.
I'm sure you'll like the place because it's very good place to hang out with your friends, and you'll be happy to give the waiters their tips because they are very very friendly and they'll be happy to serve you."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The burgers are delicious! Me and the hubby also got the macaroni balls and those were really good as well. So glad we came to try this place out, will definitely be returning!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Food is good quality and decent selection. If you have an interest in craft beers or bourbon definitely check this place out.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Worst service I have ever encountered. Took 20 min to get a cobb salad out. 15 min to get an extra side dressing for my dry salad and I'm still sitting here waiting for more water with my server no where to be found. 
Expo who brought my appetizer literally laughed when I said finally to my ranch. 
The staff is up front on snapchat im guessing just not caring about customers. 
I work in the industry and do not understand how hard it is to give good service."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Service is very slow.  Waitress never came to offer more drinks. Food not cooked an d no one apologized.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Try the truffle fries!!! Bartenders very nice and up for conversation
Great place to start the night"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I have been to Eureka! two times and both experiences were great. On both visits had ordered a burger. On my first visit I ordered the bone marrow burger. If I remember right, this burger is only offered as long as they have marrow because once they are out then the burger is no longer available that day. The bone marrow burger was simple as far as topping/condiments go, but the burger was very tasty and juicy. The buttery bone morrow definitely made this burger quite tasty. On my second visit I went with my girlfriend and ordered the bison burger. The bison burger was very tasty as well. The bison burger was topped with a mix of sautéed peppers, onions, and a jalapeño relish. The bison burger was both savory and sweet. My girlfriend ordered the napa chicken sandwich, and in my opinion, I thought the Napa chicken sandwich was more tasty than my bison burger. The sandwich was pressed, which made the buttered roll that much more flavorful and complimented the roasted Roma tomatoes, pesto, and arugula nicely. I will definitely visit Eureka! again and encourage you to do the same. Plus, they have a very nice beer selection...On my next visit I think I will try some starters and order their riblets and mussels."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I've only been here twice and I've had good experiences both times. I like that they are open late with a late happy hour as well.  I ordered the Fresno Fig Burger the last time I went and it was delicious!  The goat cheese in the burger paired really well and out table service was good.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We came here for lunch as a group of 7, in which we shared a larger table with another large party. The spacing was right so we weren't all smushed together. Service was prompt and food came out quickly. The selection of beer is wonderful and liked the overall vibe of the place. Food was awesome, especially the fried chicken sliders.  The cinnamon sweet potato fries are sooo yummy! These two items are a must try! You're gonna want to check this place out!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Whiskey selection is great.  Nice selection of craft beers.  Food is not bad. I've been here for dinner and it was packed. Service was kind of slow, I guess that's expected.  Also been here late night for drinks, bartender was knowledgeable and attentive. 

Back again for lunch. Seated right away even though place looked pretty full.  Food was hot and taste great. Can't say anything particularly stood out besides the whiskey selection.  I'd come back for lunch before dinner.

Pork sandwich was tasty but a little dry. Flavor was very unique. Prices are expected for this area. Our server Kaillie was awesome. The gal bringing out the food acted like she didn't want to be there. Everyone seemed to be fine."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"There was no surprise here. We ordered our usual Napa Burgers, even though it is now listed on the menu as a Napa Chicken burger. The waitstaff is always accommodating and puts our orders through. This time I ordered a side that I've never had there before. Because I'm trying to cut down on fries, I ordered the grilled asparagus that came with a drizzle of sauce. It was actually pretty good.it was nice to have a veggie as a side choice with a burger instead of a salad, which is the usual "" healthy choice"" option. Thumbs up Eureka"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Kids chicken tenders were disgusting. Looked like dried out potato skins. Also kit server attempted to charge us for a drink, when it was actually included with the kids meal. He had to redo our receipt, and it was obvious he already knew what was wrong. Management is usually great, so not sure who hired this guy, he acted pretty entitled to me. Needless to say we go else where for family events, as the kids meal is a no go here."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I like the nachos, the drinks are creative but expensive. It has a nice ambiance overall. The only annoying thing is people sitting at this little bar thing behind people sitting at the actual bar making it IMPOSSIBLE to walk through without scraping up against 50 people. It's supposed to be a walkway, but there's only about a 5 inch clearance. Meh."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Don't get the clams appetizer.  A lot of clam shells, very few clams.  If they were at the bottom of the dish I wouldn't know because the waitress moved the bowl away seconds after we removed the last clam shell.  I didn't want to make a scene so let her.  The bruschetta was okay, the tomato topping was great but the goat cheese spread on top of the bread didn't work with the topping."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Absolutely delicious! Came by myself after work and was nicely waited on. I had ordered an IPA, house salad and eureka burger wrapped in lettuce! The house salad was absolutely delicious ! I love how they use the spring mix lettuce with blue cheese and cranberries that's genius! Try it with the lemon dressing."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I have never had a bad meal! The chicken sliders and the cowboy burger are bomb from their entree selection, and the truffle fries as well as the chicken nachos are tasty appetizers. The hostess's are always very friendly and the waiters/waitresses do a great job of checking in often. A great place to eat if you're in downtown Santa Barbara!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I am downgrading to a 3 for two reasons: 

1) They got rid of the best burger on the menu for non-bacon lovers: Caprese. Sounded bizarre--ingredients of a Caprese salad on a burger--but it was PURE heaven. 

2) The basic burger is good but not nearly as good as American Ale. 

It's still a solid place: outstanding service, great salads, terrific appetizers, big list of wines and whiskey and beer. 

But the basic cheeseburger just lacks the X factor of ""wow, this is amazing!"" I added carmelized onions and they were just so-so and it was kinda dull. Boyfriend loves the fig marmalade burger--I'd hold the bacon--and will try it next time. Arugula, goat cheese and other stuff in including homemade fig marmalade jam. 

I like it. But notwithstanding the lack of glamour/oomph to American Ale (I'm not a dive bar girl and it's not a dive bar but it's dark without much ambiance), American Ale has replaced Eureka burger as my favorite burger in SB. 

High marks for Paradise but we just never go anymore.

P.S. I'm still a fan but annoyed so changing rating to register my annoyance over the Caprese burger and the kinda blah basic burger"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Dear Management-
Who in the world thought it would be a good idea to get rid of the buffalo fire wing sauce?! Aside from the fact that it is a cardinal sin to not offer a buffalo wing option, it was my favorite all of all the sauces you offer, which frankly aren't anything to write home about (aside from the one you decided to stop making). Moreover, I used to eat the wing's fire sauce with burgers and the truffle fries too! No offense but the other spicy sauce options suck. Bring back the fire wing sauce! Stat. 
Sincerely,
One Disappointed Sauce Connoisseur"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great food and atmosphere. Excellent Bloody Mary and Falafel bites, both on the happy hour on the weekend. Highly recommend."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Ty was the best waiter he suggested the best meal and drink (Fresno fig burger and some like it hot drink) I hope Ty is your server he's AWESOME!!! Thank you for making my first time here experience great!!!!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The wait on a Friday night is long, but don't let that discourage you (especially since there is a Brookstone around the corner - can we say chair massage?). But I digress...when you put your name in, they will text you when your table is ready.  My friend and I split the Bison Burger and the Fig Burger. Both were very different, but so delicious!! A definite must try. 

Our server Kennedy was so great. We had a friend with us that eats Vegan and she was so accommodating and made an extra effort to confirm that the meal had been modified to comply with her diet. Not something you see all the time. Thank you, Kennedy!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Love the burger. Cooked medium rare to perfection.  Juicy and tender.  Want another one!!!!  
Service was good. Caesar salad looked delicious,  BUT be forewarned the chef is extremely heavy handed on the anchovy flavor.  So much so we couldn't eat it.  Fish fish fish was all we could taste.  Great if you like that, but we don't.  A little goes a long way. They easily comped it with no issues.   The truffle fries were very salty this time. Not sure why.  Would ask them to not salt them next time b/c sauce salty enough.  
Definitely will return for another burger and more fries!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love there bbq burger.

Seems Nice qualify of eggs cooked right inside of 

Burger that made my day happy.

Keep up the good work eureka."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Always such a great lunch/dinner option. Great food options. Jordan and Tyler were so great! I got my food and drinks on time and they always checked up on my table at the right time. This place is for sure a go to option in SB.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"They have a great veggie burger, service seems to be good whenever I am their. I'm lot a meat eater anymore, but when I was at had one of Their burgers and it was great."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"They really know how to f**k shizz up!!... and not in the good way. :/
Wait time longer than Disneyland.  Really wish I painted my house prior to coming because the paint would have been dry by now.  Now I'm gonna go home to my kid a year later and he probably won't even know who I am anymore.  Beer was good though!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Great location and friendly staff. Prices are fair. Food is okay. Their French fries is delicious and crunchy, but the veggie burger was meh."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Worst service ever. Waitress never came to check up on my table. I asked for napkins and never got them. Messed up on my check and took 30 minutes  get back to me. One my friends didn't get her change so the waitress gave her the amount in quarters. Never again.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I had great experience at this restaurant...I would recommend this restaurant. The service was very good. Our waitress, ""Ally"" is an adorable server, very personable and very efficient. Our food was very good, price was fair. The restaurant itself is great and along with a lovely . I recommend it."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Great food.  Great service. Awesome beer selection.  Went back the second day for Hoppy hour 2-6 everyday.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Very good food and service. Nice atmosphere. Nice selection of IPA's and beers. Crayons and paper to keep kids entertained. One of our favorite spots for lunch in Santa Barbara.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"So I really used to like it here, but I won't go back. 

Happy hour starts at 2pm, we got seated at 1:55 pm. We ordered at 2:00 and got our drinks and appetizer at 2:15... We got charged full price because we were seated 5 mins before happy hour.... Even tho we didn't order till 2:00. We asked our waitress to adjust it and she said her manager said no. So sorry no tip and we won't be back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Estuve muy satisfecho con el servicio. El mesero fue muy atento. Pedí los nachos, no eran los mejores pero no tan mal. Me gusta que no cierran tan temprano para cenar. 

I was very satisfied overall. Service was great! The waiter was very attentive. I ordered nachos, they were not the best I've had but not to bad. I'm glad that they do not close for dinner to early. I'm definitely going to be back! :)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Love this place. Truffle fries are amazing so is most of their burgers. Our waitress Amy was super sweet and very prompt!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Now that I am visiting in Santa Barbara I am working on my many bookmarks.  ""Eureka"" was on the list.  I had dinner with family their on a Tuesday night and the place was packed.  The atmosphere was cheerful and friendly.  We were greeted and seated immediately and the entire evening was very pleasant.   This restaurant has a full bar and dining area combined there is also outdoor seating and several flat screen TVs.

We ordered three appetizers to share:  Wings, Ossobuco Riblets and Truffle Fries they were all very tasty.  The riblets were so tender the meat fell off the bones.  The fries were crunchy and seasoned perfectly.  The Wings were juicy and not overly spicy.  

For the main course I ordered the Fresno Fig Burger:   I requested my burger medium well and it was fantastic, juicy with amazing seasonings and flavor.  The other meals looked amazing and from the empty plates they must have tasted good as well.

Overall the service was great, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was welcoming."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I just want to make something explicitly clear:  This is not grass-fed beef, or organic, there are most likely some GMO vegetables and or oils being used here. Mind you that is the case in almost every restaurant in this country.

The burger was fine, definitely gourmet but I feel like there is some deceptive marketing, appealing to those who want humane treatment of food.

That and I spent 30 dollars splitting a burger with my wife and a kids quesadilla with dessert sundae. Those are grass-fed prices. 

Grass fed beef is about more than just the name. Let me explain: when a cow has eaten nothing but grass, it's fat has the same nutritional and healing attributes as salmon fat. When a cow eats grain, which it cannot digest, the meat marbles and tastes more creamy... But the fat is now bad for you. You make the cow sick, you make you sick. This is my reason for wanting grass-fed beef to be offered and am not impressed when people market food as concious without going all the way. 

To their credit however, Tte problem is, very very few people are aware of this information and assume grass fed means ""tastes weird"" and for a bunch O hippies. So they don't buy it. 

P.S. mind you the service was excellent, sweet, thoughtful ladies, great beer selection"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"My burger was cooked perfectly medium rare (not dry) and the bbq sauce was great. They have a great rotating craft beer selection where I found the hard to find St. archer Mosaic DIPA. Only reason they only get 4 stars is that they served my the wrong beer & when I asked for the correct one they were hesitant to re pour. Also, our table could have used a bit of extra attention service-wise. Overall good experience with good ambiance. Prices were fair, and they had happy hour bacon Bloody Mary for on $5!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"This place may improve, but is currently lacking. 

Don't be surprised if your burger arrives while you are still eating your salad. The servers, being young, don't seem to realize this is a problem. This was the case even on my second visit when I explicitly requested that my burger come after my salad. The management should educate the servers, who are friendly and try to do a good job. 

Burgers seem to come cooked to one level of done, regardless of request.  Also could be hotter.

Watermelon salad was delicious."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I've eaten here a few times with friends for happy hour and it's always on point! Discounts on apps and beers, $3 hoppy poppy, good service, great food, and it's open late! It's a regular place in my food/drinks rotation."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I went to Eureka for the first time with a rather large group and the service was great! They were friendly and quick. Not only that, but the food was delightful! We greatly enjoyed the Brussel Sprouts and Truffle Fries as starters. We then moved on to the Fig Burger and Mahi Mahi tacos. All of these were great choices leaving me wanting more (although I couldn't take one more bite). I definitely recommend all of these dishes and the restaurant as a whole. Go early for happy hour."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great food, awesome beer and bourbon selections, fabulous service! Our server Courtney was amazing! Very friendly staff, great atmosphere. Try the bourbon barrel cake for a sweet treat!!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"This place is expensive af for a burger and the portions are TINY. That's pretty bad coming from a girl of my size who usually can't eat half my plate!!! And they seriously skimp on the toppings!!!! Like 1 teaspoon of goat cheese, and 2 leaves of arugula on the dry ass burger and bun. I never leave reviews but really fuck this place, GO TO MESA BURGER. Half the price and twice as good!!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I had a great lunch here today! Went in and got a bloody mary, $5 happy hour on the weekend. My food came out really quickly, super delicious and flavorful. Got the bruchetta appetizer and a blue cheese burger. Everything was great and I would definitely come again. Also I wish I remembered our waitress's name because she was so friendly, accomodating, and efficient. She clearly is good at her job and I can not say bad things about her."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Awesome restaurant, one of my favorites downtown. Always great service, recently had a server named Ky and he was super helpful. Get the blues burger it's fire."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Atmosphere: So-so.
Drink: confused, they don't have irish coffee with bailey's, their's came with whiskey.  Nah thanks.
Overall, interesting menu and beer/cocktail list.  We had the aforementioned irish coffee fail, and a vodka cranberry thing that was alright.  Seemed reasonable.

p.s.  Thanks to the person who sent me a note/compliment about how irish coffee is always made with whiskey.  That cracked me up.  Ay yi yi.  Sorry I lack drink knowledge, but I promise it's neither the first nor the last time I'll make mistakes of that nature.  Ha."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The Catalina Bison Burger was awesome. Its a bit pricey for a burger at $15.50, but not too bad for a gourmet burger in Santa Barbara. Our server Kellie was of course cute (all the servers were) and very attentive. Oh, and if you're looking for a beer on tap they have umm... 30. Yup... a full bar and a huge wall on tap. The next time I go back I'm gonna have to hit up happy hour from 2-6. Drink specials and awesome half price apps."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Delicious food, fast friendly service. 4stars because I think this price is slightly off. I had the Fig, goat cheese burger with cheese balls. It was great tasting. I wanted to try the bone marrow burger but I couldn't see myself paying $17 for a burger. Overall great environment, nice bar set up and good food."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I'm not quite sure why there are so many negative reviews on here but my experience there yesterday was quite pleasant and I will definately be going back. Probably one of the best burgers I have had in Santa Barbara, the meat was cooked exactly how I asked, it had tons of flavor, the toppings were to die for, and the bun was the final perfect touch! This is probably why they are charging $12 a burger and with the location in the mall and downtown Santa Barbara Im not going to complain! The fries were delicious and the ranch dressing they have has a hint of rosemary I believe and made it super yummy. My friend ordered the Veggie burger and although a beet burger sounded skeptical and looked a little odd, he really enjoyed it. The service was great, we got our food fairly quickly, never had to ask for refills on our drinks and were asked more then once how the meal was. We will be coming back!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Great burgers. I take all my friends here when they come to town. I love the jalapeño an egg burger
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Great burger terrible service. Every time we come. EXCEPT FOR OSCAR. The other associates should take a look at his service skills; I could tell Oscar was working very hard and ALWAYS checking up on us but the others were barely reaching his level. The other bartender forgot that we ordered a barrel cake but then failed to tell us they were out. We waited about 15 minutes. When Oscar got back from his break we asked about the cake and he immediately ran back to the kitchen to check. He said that he is so sorry but they were out and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. The other bartender didn't even acknowledge us after this. Edit: shoutout to Oscar for the nice and extremely attentive service!!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Love eureka in Claremont so was excited to get a delicious burger (I don't eat burgers much) in Santa Barbara. It was late so I think they were rushing to get things wrapped up-service rushed (nice enough waiter, just seemed overwhelmed) Asked for well done hamburger and got pink meat -wanted to get it cooked further but waiter was running around and it became obvious there wouldn't be time---so my compadre who doesn't mind pink hamburger ate it. When the waiter did reappear I told him about the under cooked burger and he was apologetic but that didn't help much! He seemed to think I didn't know I could have sent it back to the kitchen - sure but not if there's no one to ask- anyway it was exasperating, late,  and I just wanted to go. So I left it at that. I probably wouldn't even have written a review except I saw a previous review describing this location as  disorganized and poor service, so I threw my 2 cents in. Maybe they just need to take a look at staffing."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The food is outstanding. Delicious burgers with an excellent selection of craft beers on tap. They have a great happy hour as well. On quarrel with the place is the service. Servers will always great you with a smile, are very kinda and have great input about the burgers and beer but when they get busy don't be shocked if you have to wait a little longer than average for service. Not the servers fault they just tend to get swamped! With all that said, it's highly recommended. Try the pearl street blues burger!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Update: A representative messaged me apologizing a long time ago about the mishaps we were experiencing. It took us some time, but we went back to Eureka to try again. My husband and I went there for a date and had a much better experience.

Once again the food was good (not the best I've had at Eureka though, however I may be biased due to what happened the last few times) and this time the service was better. The staff treated us like we were adults and were very prompt in making sure we had enough water, refill on our beers, etc. We were seated, received food/drinks, and received any help we needed at a reasonable time.

Since we had multiple bad services prior to this, I updated this to a 4/5 stars. If we go again and if the mishaps mentioned in my first review do not occur again, I'll be sure to update."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Food (bison burger) was great. Beers and single malt were money! Our server, Sam, rocked it! Personally, I think it's overpriced, but hey....it's a gourmet burger place in Paseo Nuevo....so what should I expect, right?"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Surprised at how small this location was! My usual go to dish at this place is the jalepeno egg burger. It's the best burger they have on the menu in my opinion! I can't have uncooked egg yolk at the moment so I went with the chicken pesto sandwich. Really tasty. All the flavors compliment each other. I got it with a side salad and the arugula (my fav) was super fresh and the lemon vinaigrette was the perfect dressing for the salad. Yummy. 
My husband ordered the bone marrow burger. Really juicy and tender. This is one of their most famous burgers, and paired with a tall ice cold glass of their orange wheat beer, it's a perfect combination. 
I ordered a Bloody Mary because it looked so delicious, I asked the bartender to make it virgin, and he had no problem doing so. I had to return the drink immediately. It was SO spicy that I couldn't even finish 1 sip. I just took it back and was done with it, I didn't ask him to remake it because they tend to make their bloody Mary's on the spicy side anyway. 
Overall, service was alright. For some reason we had like 3 servers at once. It was really confusing actually. And they never came by to fill our waters once. 
4 stars because the food was great! I docked one star because of the server situation. But eureka does have some of the best burgers in town."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Love the burger. Cooked medium rare to perfection.  Juicy and tender.  Want another one!!!!  
Service was good. Caesar salad looked delicious,  BUT be forewarned the chef is extremely heavy handed on the anchovy flavor.  So much so we couldn't eat it.  Fish fish fish was all we could taste.  Great if you like that, but we don't.  A little goes a long way. They easily comped it with no issues.   The truffle fries were very salty this time. Not sure why.  Would ask them to not salt them next time b/c sauce salty enough.  
Definitely will return for another burger and more fries! 

So my daughter asked to go again one day later for the same burger....yes it was that good the first and second time. Again cooked to medium rare with a perfect bun and accompaniments.  We ordered a different salad and it was delicious.  The staff was amazing to us and recognized us right away.   So I am upgrading from a 3 to a 5. Why?  The burger is amazing, the salad was good and the service today was out of this world!!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Started off really well with phenomenal burgers, beer, and great service. Lately has been rather mediocre - service sucks, burgers are a hit/miss, beer is still good! Worth a stop during happy hour for the taps and apps."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Let me start by saying it took about 1 hour to get a burger.and at least 15 minutes to get offered some water. Worst experience  ever. Server didn't even acknowledge  we were sitting there . Just running in circles around us expecting us to eat air until we called for her attention . Never again will you see me there. Especially for a simple burger and a teacup of fries for 14 dollars. Get outta here. Should a gone to habit or on n out and left wit a smile.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Very busy and popular with some good, familiar beers on tap. Pretty good for game or sporting event watching while socializing. Food is adequate to good. Feels like a high end chain vibe. The service was very efficient and timely. I suspect they turn tables quickly. All in all, it is what you would expect from a large burger spot that is churning through a lot of meals. I would go back but it is not a Santa Barbara favorite."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,We arrived with the full intention to have lunch and a beer. We were greeted immediately by the host and promptly seated. I ordered an awesome stout and nachos. We shared a delicious bison burger. To our surprise we were comped without any reason other than the fact we were getting married. Thanks to the management staff for the kind gesture. Great atmosphere and awesome whisky selection!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Eureka is a cool little hipster spot with better than average burgers. They also have a ton of local beers on tap. I like the bison burger and sweet potato fries.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Amazing burgers, great beer selection, excellent whiskey selection. Happy hour deals are really good"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Eureka was our go-to spot for a great burger, great service, and great atmosphere even with our little ones. In the past few months, since they changed their menu the service and food has gone downhill. Their burgers are NOT what they were, the beef is dry and doesn't taste fresh...like a reheated patty. Their fries are average and their kids meals are just not as good. If you've never been there I could see where you would think it was ok. But for someone who has been going to Eureka SB since their opening I'm sad to say I am so disappointed by the lack of quality. I guess the only reason we would be back is my husband still likes their beer selection."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"We have been here several times.  Food, drinks always good.  We like sitting outside. I like getting text when table is ready so we can walk around and not wait.
Service is not great.  Waiter was rude.  1/2 our order arrived late because the waiter forgot to put it in.
Not sure if we will be back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The service was great, attentive and fast. The food... I wouldn't go there ever again. The Mac and cheese was all Mac and no cheese. The burger looked good. And maybe I shouldn't have order the NY steak."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I went to this place after there was a big storm in SB. I like the place's open eating area and I got the veggie burger, which was very delicious. The service had many delays and there were many items on the manu that weren't available. They told me that, due to power outage of the storm, it had been a chaotic day. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because the burger was good. I will try this place again next time I'm in town and see if their service is better and (more vegetarian) food options are available."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The main reason for my low score on this spot is the blandness of our food. I feel like the huge onion rings and the burgers themselves have no seasoning.. Not even salt or pepper, added to them. Honestly in n out is better... Disappointing."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,So a group of us co workers decided to try out this place for a nice after work meal. We had to wait about an hour and a half for a table which seemed a little silly. I had the cowboy burger which was OK and the Cinnamon and honey fries were delicious. But when my co workers salad came out it had goat cheese in it. First off the waitress tried to fight us that goat cheese is not dairy. So instead of offering a new salad with out the cheese she made her order something new. And yes I know it was a Friday night but we only saw her maybe three times. I would stay away from this restaurant. Not worth your time.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka! It literally means ""I found it"".   The story goes that it was exclaimed by Archimedes when after a laborious effort he discovered how to tell the amount of gold in an alloy.   

I had been to Eureka many times, ate my share of burgers and appitizers, sucked down countless beers yet never found my ""gold"".  I never had that Eureka moment.  At least not until my last visit.   

It was a lazy afternoon and I was craving some well cooked meat.  Normally I would have thought of some different place but a friend told me I should go to Eureka and try the Steak Salad ($15)  I did and it was delicious.   It came with the most perfectly cooked portion of strip steak, great greens, blue cheese, grilled onions and delicious dressing.  I passed on the crispy onion rings although I wanted them and could see how they would have made it even more delicious.  

Eureka is a solid spot and while I still have never received exactly what I ordered (do they do that to everyone or is it just me?) The food is very well cooked and the place has a fun vibe to it."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,The burgers are amazing but best of all is the service I get every time from the amazing bar tender Greg G. He knows his stuff! Best bartender in Los Angeles and ventura area! He knows every drink and has amazing knowledge with craft beers and whiskey!! Love it and will recommend it to all my friends and family.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Eureka mixes wheat into corn tortilla's which are used in the nachos. 

I was sick for two days after eating their nachos and  it took weeks to find out.   The waiter served me them even when i told them I cannot have wheat.

This is exactly why wheat sensitive people avoid places like this....they just mix too many ingredients and then not make it clear on the menu."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Two stars for several reasons:
1. 20 min for food to come out
2. 22 min for drinks to come out
All placed at same time.
Felt more like a place that just opened and they were still figuring a few things out. 
3. The waiter was listening to my 3 year old niece and not to me.  
4. We were trying to pay and he was trying to sell my 3 & 6 year old nieces sundays after we just came from an Easter egg hunt (already crushed down a whole Easter egg basket of candy).
5. My steak and broccoli Were far from being cooked.

*find another tourist trap to eat at.  I love SB and live here, I've tried this place several times and always walk away UNSATISFIED!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Love the Brussel sprouts and Napa chicken sandwich. Always cold when they keep doors open, bring a jacket."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,My server Brookes was amazing! The food is to die for. Every time i have a burger craving this is the place to be! I loved the bone marrow burger. So savory and juicy. Melts in your mouth. Love this place!!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"One of the best (and probably the only) nacho spots at Paseo Nuevo! 

This cute place is perfect to dine with friends and family for lunch or an early evening. The doors are open wide so you get that nice oceanic breeze flowing through the restaurant. 

As for the food, I got the Chicken Nachos which include chicken (obvi),beans, pico de gallo, cheese, jalapenos, and a mixture of chipotle sauce and sour crema. The chips were light and crunchy, almost like wonton-style rather than the thick chip version and the chipotle sauce had a great creamy texture compared to other spots that just serve strictly salsa over the top. 

I took my lunch order to go so I am not entirely sure if the serving size is still the same or a little smaller; but, the dish was perfect for a meal for one person and is a great starter to share between 2 people. If you're a total nacho lover (like me) you might want to order another plate to share if you have more people in your party. For only $7, you got me sold! 

If you're lost, this location is located right across from California Pizza Kitchen and next to Panda Express."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!
TOURIST BEWARE!! I have never been so humiliated in my life! 
Story goes as when the manager came to double check my age when ordering a simple beer, instead of checking for my age she deliberately looked at my visa status (passport) and pointed out that my visa expired. I corrected her that it was on another page but seriously it was not in her jurisdiction to check anything pass the age. This was ridiculous, she didnt even check my age. Never had this kind of experience considering how much ive traveled. I havent even been treated this way at the airport... Gawd. This place checks your visa status instead of age to serve alcohol. Wow..."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Ate a late lunch here with my daughter. The prices are pretty high - $11 average for a burger with fries. I had the cowboy burger, she had the blue cheese. I ordered mine medium. It came out well, with not enough BBQ sauce. Taste was good. Hers was perfect. The fries were ok, but the onion rings were excellent - enormous, crisp, delicious. Problems with the service, though: We had to ask for ketchup, and the onion rings didn't come out with ranch as advertised on the menu. By the time our server got to us to check on the meal, we were halfway done. No refills on our drinks were offered. Granted, it was busy, but they had a ton of wait staff on the floor, even though we had three different servers. Lunch was $30 for two of us, no alcohol and no appetizers."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Not bad for a burger joint... Why only 3 stars
1 star . Drink selection: I ordered a mind Julep.. Too much alcohol(not complaining :) but not enough meshed mint.. 
1 star .Food was ok - but not out of those world Amazing... I ordered the Jalapeño Veggie burger minus the bacon.. Love the Chipotle sauce .. But the veggie was mushy like mashed potatoes.. It didn't hold well
.5 star Ambiance.. Everywhere smelled like spilled day old beer.. I've been to restaurant / bar before.. But the restaurant didn't suffer the smell... 

.5 Server was good :)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I love Eureka Burger. Their brussel sprouts are so good. I could eat them every day. Their burgers are the best in town. The bone marrow burger is my favorite! The desserts are not very good but who cares. The staff are friendly. And the beer is good!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Love this place! Delicious food at reasonable prices, great wait staff, fantastic ambiance! I highly recommend. Right in the middle of downtown, easy parking, fantastic food and drinks. I suggest the nachos!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Their burgers are soooo delicious! They have a great selection, including non-burger options, but I usually get the blue cheese fig burger and truffle fries. They also serve a variety of craft beers. If you are shopping in Paso nuevo you should definetly stop by for lunch!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Wow, has the quality gone down at this place! The naked burger on a bed of lemon arugula used to be my go to. Now it has no flavor and looks like a fast food burger with the buns peeled off. Instead of all arugula there's iceberg lettuce and tomato too big for the plate...it was just a mess."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Love this place! 
You must try the truffle cheese fries. They are the best. I also highly recommend the Napa Burger. 
The Happy Hour food and drink specials are good too!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"On the Thursday night burger night..hunting for the best burger...Great jalapeño burger,  plus avo.  So good."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Came in, went to get some drinks & luckily for us we had Asta and her trainee Jordan helping us out. They were incredibly nice & Jordan made us feel like we were the only people there while being at a packed bar! After drinking, we were seated at Zach's table and he gave us amazing service; always being there for when we needed something & checking in on our experience! Super super happy w our service (:"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Parking is easiest in the underground parking structure and is free for the first 75 minutes. Come between 2 - 6pm for their happy hour. I was blown away by the blues burger which consists of blue cheese, herb sautéed wild mushrooms, grilled onions, and chipotle ketchup and a side of fries. The service people including the bartender were more than helpful and I really enjoyed the Sin tax imperial stout. It had overtones of chocolate and coffee. It's in an easy to find location with plenty to do nearby; shopping, movie theaters, and what have you."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Food is good. Or...was good. Tonight we went in for dinner. We've been to Eureka over 10 times, at least. The food is always good. Until tonight. My husband and I, taking advantage of their happy hour, ordered their nachos. We've had them before and they are yummy. But tonight, instead of cubed moist chicken they gave us soggy, shredded, crock-pot like chicken. Also, the nachos are supposed to come with beans. I counted the beans.......there were 7 total beans (I sent it back asking for more beans and my plate came back with MAYBE 12 beans). Flavor was lacking. My son ordered the corn dog pops. He loves their cheddar-IPA sauce. Our server did not tell us that the restaurant no longer made this sauce (despite us requesting two sides of it), and instead brought two sides of spicy mustard sauce (he's a little kid! What was the thinking there??). I have one other complaint that I have felt for awhile, that being that the service is T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E. Don't go in there expecting to get your drinks in a timely manner. You are lucky if you get them before your meal. And even more lucky if a server comes up to you to take your order at all."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka got it right! The Jalapeno egg burger is epic. Granted our server Joel Cummings spoiled us but all and all, the experience was momentous. The selection of boutique Whiskey's was mouth watering. so if you like good whiskey and burgers, I highly recommend you call to see if Joel is working and grab a seat in his section, Bam!!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Went there and was extremely disappointed. Got 4 of the appetizers...the corn dog balls, Mac and cheese, short ribs and cheese fries and all were extremely bland. Service was horrible and staff was not attentive ."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"So I decided to take my girlfriend for a little brew run and maybe an appetizer or two before dinner on Thursday night.
We went downtown and decided to give this place another chance (our last visit was so so...).
This time, however, was PERFECT!
We set at the bar and had the pleasure of being waited on by a lovely bartender named Gabby.
She was ON! She gave us great recommendations from the rotating beer list and recommended some awesome appetizers to go with it.
I had the chicken sliders and the Baked Mac & Cheese... Wow! 
It's an amazing place with a really good bar staff!
(:"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Easily the best happy hour in town! Went in for beer and apps, all of it at discounted prices. Jordan took our drink orders and Juan took care of us the rest of the way. Both were very friendly and accommodating to me and my girlfriend, as we didn't want to sit by the window since it was cold out. Manager Oscar came over to check on all of our food, which was delicious! Definitely will be coming back!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I split the egg bacon cheese burger. It was awesome. Quick service,delicious food,fun atmosphere. 

I was told they have a great variety of tequilas."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Items ordered: chicken Cobb salad, chicken wings, original hamburger and onion rings. Onion rings were thick-cut and tasty. Cobb salad was good with baby greens and hearty chunks of blue cheese & bacon. Hamburger was juicy and bread didn't break apart. Overall we were satisfied with our meals. Rip off alcoholic drinks."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"One of my favorite spots in SB. Whether you want to stop by for a quick drink, or sit down and enjoy a meal, it's a great place for either. They always have a great selection of beers on tap that change. So, there's a good chance you'll be able to try something new every time you visit. If you're not a beer person, don't worry, they have a full bar and wine. You will also not be disappointed in the food. Their specialty is burgers, and all of them are delicious. However, they also have a great starters selection. I recommend the mussels. I've never had mussels with pancetta and jalapeños before. Made for a great combination."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I've been to this restaurant several times. It is loud and pricey, so not a favorite of mine, but it is close to the movie theater we were going to. The food is usually good, though it suffers from ""one too many"" ingredients much of the time.

I will not be going back though, after last night. We were welcomed by a friendly host and then we sat, completely unacknowledged, for 15 minutes. 

We had left plenty of time for dinner before the movie, but after waiting awhile, with no server coming by, we wondered if almost 2 hours would be enough. 

I tried to catch eyes politely. The host said nothing, waiters walked on either side of our table, serving others, and avoided eye contact. No one offered a glass of water, no one apologized. 

We are middle aged and white. Shortly after we were seated, another, younger, couple, the man pale and red-headed, the woman a light-skinned African American, were seated at the table very close next to us.  My husband started a timer on his watch. All four of us became more and more twitchy, looking at our watches, as ten more minutes went by.

Two more tables were seated near us, and still, no waters, no servers. My husband, more generous than me, said ""give them 5 more minutes, maybe there's a backup."" Finally we left, walking a block to the much better burgers at Paradise Cafe.

""My limit is fifteen minutes, timed, without even an acknowledgement,"" said my husband, as we walked. And as we ate our excellent burgers and fries a block away, we joked, wondering if any of the diners we were seated with ever got served. We should have invited them to join us."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Just simply amazing. Best burgers in town. I highly recomend the fresno burger without the mustard, and the cowboy burger. I also enjoyed their sweet potato honey fries."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love this place! My favorite in Santa Barbara. You HAVE to try the Protein Chopped Salad with salmon, and ask for Connor.  He was an amazing server! They have a great wine selection, and the happy hour is awesome......go for the Brussels Sprouts and yummy Mac and cheese balls!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Are you kidding me?! What is the wait time all about? 

Save your time people. There are tons of better places steps away."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We've recently revisited, and the service was exceptional!  We actually got to meet the manager, he was friendly & accommodating! The burgers were tasty & as always go great with beer. We took our family here while visiting, and they loved it too. 

For a full experience, we recommend going to McConnells after for dessert. Burgers, beer, ice cream"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Went up to santabarbra for the day, wanted to try's nice restaurant for dinner and this was the place recommended by anyone we asked. The problem was, the food was delicious , perfectly cooked , presented well, tasted good, but a couple hours later I began to feel really nauseous. When I asked my best friend ( who ordered the same exact thing as me) she said she was also feeling extremely nauseous . This is a shame because I really loved the food but the after affect was just very negative."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"This place gets only 3 stars from me for one reason and one reason only: the service is subpar. Now, the food is excellent. Their beer and whiskey selection is also fantastic. The service though... dear lord."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Cool atmosphere, nice vibe to the place. That being said, the service was okay and the kitchen was really slow. The classic Eureka was a nice burger. My fries were so salty I couldn't eat them. My companion enjoyed his fish taco, but thought the ambience was a lot like Champs!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I came into Eureka yesterday with a friend and the food was delicious. We ordered the brussel sprouts and the mac and cheese balls for appetizers. It was phenomenal! The service was exceptional too, our server Joel was incredibly friendly, attentive and charming! I definitely recommend stopping by, as a local or as a visitor, Eureka is the place to go!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"It wasn't a bad place, me and my boyfriend were new to the city and wanted to try something different, the burger and nachos were really good. The only thing I didn't like was that I asked for a lemonade and I got something completely different from what I thought. Didnt really like it, but the waiter was nice enough to exchange it for something else. Overall great place!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Hmm, I'm not going to lie, but I actually like certain elements of this place. It's got a party vibe. Great for adult groups. The fries were pretty good drunk munchies. Their beer size during the 2-5pm happy hour is very good. 

However, I though the burgers were so-so. The meat was fine, but the bread was too soggy and stale. There was a little bit of a miscommunication when I got the wrong burger, but thankfully service was nice and solved the mix-up within a few minutes. 

Overall it should be a 3.5, as the burger could be improved on. Personally I prefer the Nook Burger over this one."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Met Sean who I believe was the floor manager and he was great. He truly knew about the beer that Eureka was selling. Great experience will be back
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Came here with a party of 14 on a Thursday night. The restaurant is pretty small, so we had a friend who was downtown put down our names at 5:30, and then we headed over at 7:30. We didn't end up being seated until 8:30, so definitely make sure you put in your name early for a large party! I think you put in your name and then they text you when your table is available. It happened that they only had one area set up for large parties, and I guess a few people from the party before us were still seated even though most of the group had left. The waitresses kept thinking that the people left would finish their drinks quickly and head out, but after waiting for an hour at the restaurant, the waitresses finally asked the 4 people remaining at the table if they could move them to a smaller area so our group could sit down. The party before definitely didn't realize there was another group waiting for the large table, so they were really nice about leaving. It wasn't their fault or the waitresses fault, so we really had no complaints about that! It would have been nice if there was more room at the bar though because it was packed and we ended up just waiting outside even though it was pretty chilly.
 
Once we were seated, the service was super fast and we all got our food really quickly. I got the shredded chicken tacos. They were really good, but the jalapeño made them pretty spicy. I definitely cannot handle spiciness, so I think next time I would order the tacos minus the jalapeños. Also when it says it includes avocado, it was basically only one slice per taco which was kind of a bummer. But besides that the tacos were really good!
Other dishes our table ordered included the nachos. The nachos were huge and a bunch of people at our table got them and split them. If you wait for Happy Hour at 9 then they are cheaper. The beers are cheap as is, with some of them only $3 even when Happy Hour wasn't happening. 
The girl next to me got a cobb salad which looked really delicious, and the guy next to me raved about how much he liked his Jalapeño Egg burger. 

I like that you can substitute any patty with a veggie or turkey patty. We had a couple of vegetarians in our party so I was a little worried when I heard we were going to a burger place. But once I saw the menu I realized they had a ton of options for everyone. 

The staff was really friendly and they brought out a Sundae for my friend's birthday. There was also a really great live singer, and we really enjoyed her song choices. I really liked the atmosphere and would definitely come again, I just wish the restaurant was larger since it was so crowded!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Came in the other night and the server Connor offered to try Truffle fries. I tried em with a hoppy poppy and they were amazing. Thanks for the suggestions Connor. Had a night
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"After arriving at Eureka! the server was quite helpful in helping us with our beer selection. From that point on things went downhill fast. Upon taking our orders the server tried to up-sell every item we ordered. We even brought it up to him thinking it may deter him. It did not.

 My wife ordered the fish tacos which turned out to be jerky fish tacos (not good), I had a blue cheese burger. I'm not a big meat eater so I thought to substitute the beef for turkey. Big Mistake. Our sons burgers arrived and looked great. My turkey burger was easily 1/3 the size of my sons burgers and over cooked. 

The service was ok. Severs were not friendly, more like sharp and to the point.
The final slap was my wife did not want fries with her tacos so asked for salad instead. A small amount of salad was substituted on her plate and they charged her for a side salad. 

This place is already expensive for what it is and they are still trying to squeeze more out of you. Not me. First time was the last time."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,First timers.  After farmers market stop for a beer and happy hour apps. Sweet potato fries with cinnamon and honey. Half price wine to wash it down. We loved it
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Went there for the first time a couple of nights ago with some friends and sat out on the patio because my friend needed a space for his puppy. Accommodating staff and delicious food. Will be back again.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,The food here is really good and inexpensive for the area. They have a great beer selection. Good spot to drink and watch sports or to get a relatively cheap meal with quality food and service. Their cowboy burger is the best burger I've had in town but I also don't eat many burgers
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I love Eureka, but they need a better system for hearing customers over the phone when placing take out orders.  

The other night I tried to phone in dinner to go for my boyfriend and I and couldn't believe how loud it was on the other end of the call.  Consequently, the girl couldn't hear my order after I repeated it three times and said so in a rather unprofessional manner.  ""Umm what? I totally can't hear anything you're saying, what?"" I know the noise is on her end because I can hear it!  I tried calling back and got this same runaround.  

So a couple nights ago I decided to give it another try with my father while he was in town.  We walked in at 7pm on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was packed and super loud.  I took one look at my dad and knew it would drive him nuts and we'd spend our whole dinner yelling across the table to each other so we went next door to CPK.   

Eureka definitely caters to a younger crowd which left it as not really a great option for dinner with my father.  The noise level is pretty intense.  

I will say that I think the food is delicious and I have enjoyed many a night sipping wine on their patio (much less noisy than inside) with my boyfriend.  Would I recommend taking parents, grandparents or anyone older and sensitive to noise here for dinner? Nope- but I bet their lunch hour is much quieter.  

I will definitely return to Eureka, but I'm hesitant to order anything to go after the unpleasant experience I had trying to place my order last time.  Maybe an online to go ordering system would be helpful?"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I had an amazing watermelon salad here! Great place if you want to take the time and sit down, but also be in a relatively casual environment. I will be happy to go back again sometime soon."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"My wife, 17 month old and I were served by Joel. My wife and child were exhausted from a day downtown and I had just gotten off of work. I felt like Joel sought us out the perfect amount of times to check on us throughout our experience. Never did I feel like he was invasive or unavailable. My daughter started fussing with the crayons and children's menu, so Joel brought her avocados and watermelon. He didn't realize that avocados are her favorite. He was patient with the change in our orders, and was available whenever we asked for something else. Totally looking forward to our next visit here, and hoping to get someone with as much focus on customer service."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We got off to a very slow start. Showed up for a birthday lunch and took the table next to the bigger part of our party. We must have stood there for about 15 minutes waiting for someone to come and clean off the table as numerous servers walked by. Finally we asked and someone came over, saying, ""Oh, I didn't realize you were with them."" Does that imply that if we weren't, we wouldn't have been seated or served?

Once we sat down, things were fine. My wife's salad was good, not great, while my burger was pretty much amazing (Jalapeno Egg Burger). I suppose when you go to a burger place, you order a burger! The fries were decent and the kids meal we got for our little ones was okay. The pasta was pretty dry, but our server was good enough to bring the kids little plates of carrots, ranch and one other tasty item which I can't remember.

Actually looking forward to visiting again and trying out what other burgers they have to offer."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The burger was good, and the fries were hot. However, I've been coming here for years and the new aprons the bartenders have to wear are abysmal. Who decided that brown leather with a black shirt was a good idea? Additionally, I am automatically suspicious that people wearing those aprons don't know how to make cocktails. It actually decreases my trust in them because I think they're compensating for crappy drinks in a ""hip"" atmosphere. Beer is still good, though..."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Yummy mussels! Just barely made it for happy hour...very glad to have chosen Eureka! Next time I'm in Santa Barbara I will visit and recommend to others! Reitetating: mussels in broth with pancetta were delicious...the bread to dip in the broth was tasty; only suggestion--the fish tacos needed crema. Our server was great! Very personable. Also we were served quickly!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"""Random act of kindness""
Never been here before. My first time was with my friend and we came here for dinner before going to a show down the street. Our server was awesome! High energy and very attentive :) all the food was amazing but what really stick out was the end. The server who dropped off our check was a different, equally as awesome guy and he dropped the bill and said we got a random act of kindness and they took care of our whole bill. I was completely awe struck! I've never had anything like that happen to me before and I didn't know what to do. Either way I would have came back again but that just sealed the deal! I'm still in shock! Thank you!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,So sad how a place with such popularity has repeatedly displayed bad service each time I've came here. Basically management and its servers should attend a 2 week training program on customer service and how to be a decent server. Never will I ever come back. Period.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Just ok. I had the cowboy burger, which barely had any barbecue sauce and the bun seemed a bit stale. The riblets and truffle fries however, were super tasty. I liked the coleslaw too. The servers are scattered all over and multiple people served us. The hubby had the jalapeño egg burger and a porter and loved both. I don't do jalapeños, but he said it definitely had a nice kick. Seems like a great place for college kids who like to get together and drink some beers."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Pretty delicious chicken sandwich! Fun atmosphere... Dog friendly patio... Can you please have a breakfast menu?
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,Took my family of 4 for lunch.  The food portions were small for all the dishes we ordered. The fish tacos had little actual fish; it was mostly greens. The pulled pork sandwich was dry. We ate at Silvergreens yesterday and liked it much better.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Ate there with a group of 4 for dinner and had an enjoyable meal. I would definitely go back again. I had the fig marmalade burger which was a clever combo and nice and juicy with great flavor. Fries were good too, and they have a huge selection of beer. Service was good, courteous, and food came within a reasonable time. I really like a good burger, and I seek out good burger places, and this place is worth the trip."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,the location and food are good. However，the server is so slow. i had to stand up twice to walk to the desk to ask the order and check. Seem like only the assigned waiter could help while other servers couldnt help. Not sure if it was a problem only on my table. the more people at next table was later arrived than my table but they finished and left earlier than us.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"May 26, 2018.  My burger arrived rare instead of the medium that I ordered.  The efforts that management went through to make things right was so thoughtful.  I kept my fries while they re-made my burger.  They could have just continued to cook the rare burger, but made a new one for me.  The new one arrived with a heapful of more fries (hooray).  The manager and our server apologized and checked in many times.  The place itself was loud (Saturday night and a game on) but the service was Stellar."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I had the chicken sliders, truffle fries, and a specialty limited time cocktail. Steve was a fantastic server he literally held my hand through the whole experience lol! I throughly enjoyed this night in Santa Barbra! I will be back"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Eureka is the most amazing craft beer burger joint you'll find!  Delicious and not to expensive...We come weekly and wouldn't change that.... Customize burgers ANYWAY you like them!  John is a fantastic manager for this company...Thanks Eureka for being Awesome!  We love you!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This place has yet to let me down. There is always at least a 20 minute wait but I think it's worth it. I might be behind the times but i love that they text you to let you to let you know your  table is ready, very innovative/ convenient. Makes it easy to walk down the street to Elsie's for a beer while you wait( their bar is normally crowded)

They have a wide variety of food choices which is refreshing. I've probably tried half of their specialty burgers and enjoyed every bite. I really like their bison burger and my boyfriend always compliments the fig marmalade. Also their sweet potato fries are to die for. Onion rings are good as well but they seem to skimp out on the portions with those.

As far as service , I've had good and bad experiences there. It seems like they keep themselves pretty heavily staffed so generally the waiters are pleasant and knowledgable. I did go there once for lunch with some co-workers and their power was out. Despite the inconvenience and limited menu( they pretty much only had salads available) the server kept it calm and collected and we ended up having a great time. Got to try their Cobb salad which is another favorite for sure.

Their beer selection is great and reasonably priced. Get the beer of the day which is normally the hoppy poppy IPA, great quality for an awesome price."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"-jalapeno egg burger is delicious
-fries that came with it are.. meh. maybe i should get the truffle fries next time
-good happy hour"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love Eureka and go here all the time but try and only go for lunch or early dinner because waiting for a table at night can be close to two hours on a weekend. My favorite burger is the Fig Marmalade Burger, Absolutely to die for! Their buns are amazing but I often opt for a naked burger instead which comes with lettuce tossed in a light dressing. On the side you have the option of fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings or salad. I get salad with blue cheese dressing. Very yummy! And they have Telegraph California Ale on tap, my favorite! Also, those of you who like to add hot sauce to everything, they have an amazing sauce they put on their wings and it is awesome on burgers/fries. Oh! They are also pet friendly! You can bring your dog on the patio."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Mac cheese and truffle fries are the best.
Mahi mahi tacos are dry 
Chicken fries sliders are ok! Spicy!!
Watermelon salad, just ok!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Solid place for a burger, apps, and tons of beer and drink options. Never disappointed"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Different and interesting burgers on menu.Meat seems to be very good quality, buns are brioche. Cost for burger with fries is around $11. Good beer menu. Fun, lively vibe- noisy and crowded. Lots of TV's with all kinds of sports playing. Been twice- liked it the first time better. All in all, a good place, but a bit pricey."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Taylor was the best server ever! So friendly and cute and she suggested the perfect beer with my Napa burger. Will be returning!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"****Edit*****
After writing this review, the manager contacted me and gave me a gift certificate to come back.  Since then I have been back several times and there service while not perfect has improved 10 fold. I guess its an SB thing, but good servers seem hard to come by.  But Eurkea seems to be improving in that department. 




I tried this place a few times when it first opened. The service was terrible and the food was OK. There are better Burgers in town. For a Burger Place the burgers and fries are just not that good. 

Also the sweet potato fries we ordered were clearly frozen.  I  am bummed this place isn't better.

Lastly the service is still bad. I wont give it another chance."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"My girlfriend and I love this place! It's friendly, warm and the service is wonderful! The bartender's name is Greg and he rocks! Always hooks us up and gives us great service... Try the Fig Marmalade Burger!  It's amazing!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Been here twice after the last review. Last time we ordered the burgers medium and medium rare. Both returned well done. They offered to remake the meat but having already waited for 20 mins to get a table and coming in for a late lunch we didn't  want to wait. I had also asked for ranch....it didn't come until the manager is me over to take care of us, offering me to remake my burger now as they had to correct paddy. I gave my food back, with mostly eaten fries but full burger bc I didn't get the ranch still. They brought back my burger with a medium well paddy and new fries. Offered dessert. Finally brought over ranch and refilled our water. This outing took an hour and a half. We didn't take the dessert. The burger was great! Too full for fries. 4 stars for great customer service after a mess up."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I had such a wonderful experience and I wish i had remembered to yelp sooner. My boyfriend and i went here for our 1 year anniversary and I am so glad we did. The food was delicious, and well priced but the service was the highlight of the night. Nona, our server was exceptional, she was caring, helpful and she even took the time to bring us a dessert upon learning of our anniversary! The service and food and atmosphere made our night perfect and for that I am giving this place five stars."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I've been to this Resturaunt several times and have ordered an array of different entrees and appetizers. I have never been disappointed with a menu item and the bison burger and their wings are delicious. I highly recommend Eureka if you're getting together with friends and want to hang out and watch a game on one of their many televisions around the bar.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Great place to grab a burger and a beer. I spent the weekend in Santa Barbara and was happy to find Eureka! Service was great and the food was delicious. The Fresno Fig Burger and the Mac and Cheese Balls are amazing. Definitely coming back next time I'm in SB.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Atmosphere was great. Alex was on point. The bruschetta's ingredients were good. The meals were quick and well prepared. The steak in my salad was a great medium rare. The sweet potato fries and fig burger were awesome. Good staff that worked together. We very much enjoyed our visit.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love this place. I come here 3 times a month- the staff is friendly and courteous. The service is fantastic, and the burgers are amazing. I am used to top notch Texas-service, and since moving to SB, this is the best service in town. I love their $3 deal on the hoppy poppy, and the bartenders are really cool. Keep up the AWEsome work!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Gave it another go ... x2 . Had a friend in from LA Vallery who wanted a Veggie Burger.. and this quite persnickety person was very very pleased with what he got .. Beet Burger said it had good hearty satisfying taste and texture.  HE LOVED the Sweet potato fries and they gave us great service .. seated us right t away infact for a busy joint .. impressive.

Went the following day .. I had  the Buffalo Whiskey ..nice !  This other buddy had the $6 Nachos wuth chicken all  Yumm were really good.. place is pumpin and really glad SB  has Eureka !"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"My burger was practically charcoal and I told the server who told her manager. I just wanted to let them know, maybe give a heads up to the kitchen, I had no expectation of compensation. And yet the manager comped the burger. That more than anything else makes me willing to give this place another chance. It seems if people were constantly complaining, the manager wouldn't be so free with the compensation.
Also, the fries were excellent and all the produce for the burger was fresh and delicious.
Will try again."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"They didn't have backayard bastard on tap but the small amount they had was on the house. :) 
The veggie burger was Delicious! avocado is a pricey when you add it on ($ 2.00) and it's barely half of a small avocado. Had to ask for ranch twice cause it never came the first time. Very beautiful and hip place inside and out. The fries were my favorite part! Our waiter was attentive and friendly :)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I went to Eureka burger for the third time to see if I could have a little bit of a better experience. I went on a Monday night to avoid the crowd and was seated immediately which is always nice. Our server was Amanda and she was all smiles (and answers when my girlfriend had questions about one of the burgers).

I had the Hickory Pulled Pork Smoked Sandwich and it was really tasty. The salad went great with it ($1.25 upgrade from fries but it was worth it). Check out my picture of the dish. 

Overall a better experience then my previous one. Will be back if I am in the mood for a fancy burger."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Ordered through sbmenus.com and food arrived on ice. That means cold fries, cold burger, along with the inability to follow directions I had submitted with order to cook the bacon until crispy, and include ranch dressing -- for the cold fries."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Amazing burgers and beers. One of my favorite restaurants in all of Santa Barbara. Great for sports games and and family fun. Tons of TVs, great apps, huge choice of burgers, all around great spot."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I love eureka for its delicious burgers, awesome beer selection, and late hours. But there's a little bit of false advertising at work when they say $2 off ""all"" draft beers during happy hour ... And it doesn't include the 15 or so draft beers listed on the chalkboard. Anyway, I'll be back, but $10 for a pint of beer is pretty ridiculous and makes me reconsider"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Eureka! was so good, visiting one time during my short stay in Santa Barbara just wasn't enough. I found that the service was spotty: one day we had great service, and the next day the service was slow at best. However, both times the food was absolutely fantastic! 

My boyfriend ordered the jalapeño egg burger and I had the tortilla burger. Both burgers were full of flavor, cooked perfectly, and came in reasonable portions. I can honestly say that it was the best burger I have ever eaten. Filling a tortilla with the burger was perfect because it avoided the slippery bun, the excess bread flavor, and the tortilla tamed the spicy flavors of the jalapeños and guacamole really well. In addition to our burgers, we also ordered the truffle fries appetizer. The appetizer was a shareable size and was a great touch to our meals.

Many people in the restaurant also enjoyed and said good things about their salads. It seems as though regardless of what you order from Eureka!, it is bound to be pretty delicious."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,My wife and I came in one evening for a quick happy hour and were immediately greeted by Erika. She was very friendly and that made us feel very welcome! We ended up getting a couple rounds at the bar and are super excited to come back soon! Thanks to the staff here for an awesome time
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Burgers taste great but it's clearly overpriced
If you want to get a double, you'll pay $5 for the extra.
If you want a ridiculous salad instead of the fries, you'll pay $1.5 extra for that

Last time I ate there, I took the double bison burger and paid $8 the second patty ! First time of my life that I have had to pay more than $20 a burger !

Fortunately it's good but definitely not enough for this price"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,We found hair in our food. Didn't take our order got 20 mins... It was pretty empty too. Really bummed won't be coming back. This place has been up and down every experience here and I think it's time to let it go.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Yummmmm!!!! Nachos were excellent. Ditto for the chicken sliders which were flavorful and spicy.

I will be back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Food was really good, and our waiter was great but the drinks are ridiculously overpriced. Yes you have lots of whiskeys, but that doesn't mean you should be charging $5 for one that a bar down the street has.

I asked a bartender for a Rye suggestion, somewhere above well, but not top shelf, and he suggested two for my old fashioned. Then he came back and said he was out of both but he could make it with another Rye. Ha ands me my drink and it was $18?! Sorry but that's just bad bart ending and service trying to make a buck. 

I'd come back for the food but I'll make my way anywhere else for a drink"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Always a great place to come. The Hawaiian burger and the green beans are a must. Any burger actually. The fig one is YUMMMM. I am drooling just thinking about it. So bomb but always packed so make a reservation!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"the location is great and their burgers are really not worth the wait. we waited about one hour to get in and the service is very courtious and nice, but none the less i will not wait again."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"First off,  I would like to state that my family and I are sad. Eureka used to be one of our favorite places to eat in SB.  We have seen service and attention to detail consistently diminish over the last year.  I know the owners received a lot of money to grow the company and since their expansion food consistency and service have been horrible.  
We just had lunch at Eureka a few min ago and our food took a long time to come out and they got 2 of our 4 very simple orders wrong so we had to send the orders back.  We didn't didn't get a single table touch or refill during our entire meal.  Not to mention there was a stench of sewer water near the bar and restroom area.  We used to love the brand, concept and service when it first opened.  I really hope they pull it together because Eureka will no longer be on our list of local restaurants to frequent."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"This would be 3.5 stars.  The service was pretty good.  The burger was okay - better than fast food places, but not as good as the Counter burger chain.  We got the original burger, and the fries were kind of soggy.  I would come back again though, to try a different flavor and see if that might be a better experience."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,My friends over at UCSB took me to Eureka for the first time and it was awesome. They had a great selection of beers and the burger I had was great. I highly recommend going here.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I am not in Santa Barbara often but was told by some friends that I had to try this place and I'm glad we did! Delicious burgers and great service! I would pass the recommendation on any day!!!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,I have been here a few times now the burgers and sandwiches are delicious. The service was very good in the atmosphere is nice.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times when I visit my son at school.  The food is fresh, they have a wide variety of wines and beers and always seems pretty busy. The serving staff is friendly and our waitress was very nice. I am deducting a star because the hostess was so cold. No smile hello, very business like and not really what you want your first impression to be. At least a smile or enjoy your lunch. When we were leaving we passed the host stand and a man behind it was very nice. Thanks for coming, . The same unfriendly hostess was standing next to him and it was like we were invisible. Maybe she was the manager, I don't know, but she needs to at least pretend to be friendly. People have a lot of choices for dining  so if someone chooses to eat at Eureka the hostess should at least appear to be happy they chose Eureka."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Extremely average. The onion rings had no taste to them and required a ton of sauce to make them appealing, however the BBQ and ranch couldn't beat McDonalds."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"We tryed this place cause of the reviews online. We are from out of town, we had to wait longer then we were told. But the manager was kind enough to give us an appetizer on the house. That was super cool. The food was good."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I've been going here for the past eight months and the quality has really gone downhill. Everything seems to be shrinking smaller and smaller. It's a great place for lunch because of the location (and the fact that they have a great selection), but every time we go the burgers seem to get smaller, the salads are getting smaller (and using fewer of the nice ingredients), and this last time we ordered a plate of fries - at $4 - and it was the most pathetic plate of fries I've ever seen. It was all the stubs...and nobody wants the stubs! The amount was pitiful. We literally had to ask the waitress if that was the $4 side of fries and even she seemed a little ashamed to say yes. 

It's a bummer the quality seems to be going down b/c it's usually a great place. 

Be warned that the sweet potato fries are sweet - they're drizzled in cinnamon and honey. Good, but not the usual sweet potaters."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"My wife and I had high expectations of this place after we heard good things about this burger joint from friends.  We arrived around 6:30 thinking that we'd have a nice quiet dinner.  Well, it's not that type of place.  It was swarming with people but we decided to stay.  Their point-of-sale system is done through iPads so it was cool when I got a text that our table was ready.  We didn't like the table so we sat at the bar.  

The bar staff was amazingly nice and enthusiastic.  They recommended the truffled fries.  They were soggy so we sent them back only to be served another plate of the same soggy fries.  Blush has WAY better truffled fries, btw.

The great thing for me about this place was the selection of whiskeys and bourbons so I tried one of their house bourbons.  It was delicious and we also ordered a sampler of some others including a chocolate bourbon which my wife loved.

My wife ordered the shrimp sandwich and I the mushroom burger.  She loved hers.  I was just okay with mine.  The bread, although fresh baked, was spongy enough to be a McDonald's Big Mac bun and very bland tasting.  My burger was perfectly cooked but was also bland.  The bourbon helped here.  

Overall, we had a great time talking to the bar manager about this and that and the ambiance was that of a hipster bar out of San Francisco.  We had a great time but next time I'm choosing a different burger.

Go for the drinks and appetizers, not for a great burger."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Really great food,  wonderful and unexpected beer options.   Loved the impromptu Easter Egg hunt!   Excellent service."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,While this is a popular spot to grab a beer and burger it lacks something. For example service isn't always great and sometimes they are extremely slow. Some of their food is tasty and some of it needs improvement. The quality in the food makes it seem like just another chain restaurant such as Red Robin. They do have a good happy hour though.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Great food and great service. For burgers I've tried the tortilla burger and the cowboy burger, both great. Their fries are super good and they have good appetizers. When I checked in with yelp I got free chicken nachos and those were really good. Great guacamole in the nachos. Their beers are all pretty hoppy but the price of food is super reasonable. They always have football on TV on Sundays which is awesome because they have a LOT of TV screens."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Kody is the absolute best server ever!!!!!!! I worked at a Brewery/Concert Hall/Restaurant and no server I knew or even myself was as quick, kind, and FUN!!!!!! It was my friends 21st birthday and Kody made it fun, and unforgettable! We will always come to Eureka when we visit SB and we will now be going to Eureka in our home town San Luis Obispo more often but it won't be the same without Kody!! We love you!!!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Hardly ever had a mediocre experience at the bar.  Never have had a bad experience.  The bartenders clearly are not managed.  Inexplicably tend to forget the left side of the bar in favor of the right, while favoring serving the servers over the bar customers.  Bartender Zach has an obvious disdain for customers."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Eureka has great food, but this location is unkept and disgusting. We took our dogs and sat outside. Our glasses were dirty, the water was murky, and the waitress held our straws where we drink out of them. Their service is friendly, but slow. Very slow. Our dogs turned green from melted crayons left on the ground. I had to scrub them clean with napkins in the heat. It didn't come off all the way, my car is now stained with green crayon marks. Again, good food that's why i gave it two stars, but the cleanliness was unacceptable."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Just finished my first meal here. Ordered the veggie burger and all I have to say is that beet patty is delicious! Happy with the beer selection, they have a wide selection of beers on tap and a list of ten that are supposedly supposed to rotate weekly. This is only the second day of business for them so obviously the servers and entire staff are still trying to find their groove, but service was good and very friendly. Seems like a good place to have dinner with big groups or just enjoy after work beers with friends. I look forward to more dinners here."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I heard about this place and decided to treat my husband to lunch. I must say I was extremely disappointed. It took 15min to get our drinks. He was served his beer BEFORE I was served my flat coke. When our meals arrived 20min later, the mushrooms on my burger were cold and tasteless. I didn't receive mayo on my burger as requested. When I asked for a side, I was told they had to ""restock"" it. 15min later it came, but by that time my burger was cold along with my fries. Our waitress asked if we wanted some fresh watermelon & avocado for our baby (so nice!) but after explaining he wasn't fond of either, a nice man brought the plate to us anyway. Our waitress was very nice and we did enjoy the atmosphere. I've lived in SB all my life and enjoy good food and beyond good service. However this wasn't it. I doubt we will return. :("
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,My favorite place for a beer in Santa Barbara.  30 taps and a well educated staff!  Beer selection is well thought out with fair pricing... I will be back every time I visit Santa Barbara :) !
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,30 craft beers on tap + a diverse amount of gourmet burgers = new home.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Had a great time here. Jalapeño Egg burger was what I ordered and it was delicious!

Tried the grapefruit cocktail and it had too much ice and tasted a little flat. 

Overall good experience though"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This was my second time to the restaurant. The first time I ordered the veggie burger- not sure if it was always called the veggie beet burger then- holy mistake. I'm a meat eater, so I don't know what came over me to try to be different, when it came I was surprised, but when I tried a bite, I was sad hahah. My friend on the other hand LOVES this burger. So if you're looking for something a little different, here ya go. Fries....more like pieces of fries. Like the left overs you get at the bottom of your order of fries. Good flavor, but I had to use a fork to scoop them up- literally in pieces. 
The next time I was there, I ordered a tortilla burger- holy yum! A burger wrapped up and grilled into a tortilla. I seriously want to attempt this at home. There's guacamole, jalapeños, cheese, onions...etc. This burger was juicy and delicious, very well cooked. I was about 4 bites in when I realized it was dripping like crazy all over and onto the plate. Worth the mess? Yes. But I've warned you! Again, the fries came out in pieces. Is that their thing?? Is that how they serve the fries each time? My friend agreed that it was weird. We ordered a side of sauce when the server set the food down, but we never saw it and we were asking for water pretty often, so the service wasn't all with it. When we sat down we saw the list of beers that were 3 bucks on tap during the time that we were there, so we lucked out. And they had bloody mary's on special as well. Though they weren't special. Definitely missing the alcohol and any sort of spices. I'll skip that next time. 
They have a great little patio in the center of SB though, great spot. Huge restaurant inside, lots of space to sit at the bar as well. Definitely a good place, I'll be back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Excellent selection of craft beer and whiskey. The food is good but too expensive, even by Santa Barbara standards."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, maybe gourmet burgers, at least great fries.  But I was disappointed on both accounts.

Cons:
- I had a burger with a turkey patty which was on the dryish side and a tad salty tasting.  Not terrible, but I wouldn't order it again.  The turkey burgers across the street at Silver Greens are much more moist and tasty.
- The fries looked good.  However, they were mushy and cut very short in length, which made them difficult to eat.
- It was very loud inside the restaurant.  You had to raise your voice to be heard across the table.
- Burgers cost $10-11.  This is on the high side, especially for a burger that wasn't that great.

Pros:
- Very friendly employees and staff.
- Good burger bun, but not good enough to save the burger.

I think this is only the 3rd or 4th day they've been open, so it's possible they are experiencing growing pains.  This place seems to have potential, but they already have a number of locations.  What we experienced today might just be the best they can do..."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I hate to give this place only three stars because it a great spot to go if you want to hang out at the bar and get some good beer and bar food. Their happy hours are rocking and the bartenders are always friendly.

I give the three stars because I wouldn't recommend this place as a restaurant because usually the service is pretty slow and myself or others always have to send food back because it wasn't prepared right. 

If you are looking for a good beer and a superb happy hour then definitely come here."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,the burgers are good the beers are great and the service is ok
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Came here for happy hour during the week. Everything was excellent (get the truffle fries!) and all the servers (especially Kaillie) were super friendly! Would definitely recommend coming here for drinks and apps. Happy hour is a great deal.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"PROS:
1) Menu looks yummy, however,
so far I have only tried the taco salad:
- good flavor, although one negative on this dish was that there was hardly any meat  they need to add a bit more so you are not left with just greens after 3 bites...

2) Good beer selection

3) Good service!  No attitude!  Took care of my high-maintenance friend and all her requests without even breaking a sweat!  This is a MAJOR plus in this town. 

4) outside tables - yay!

5) dog friendly (staff was helpful and brought us a water dish)


CONS:
1) Too friggin loud!  We sat outside because the inside music was SO incredibly loud. People were having to yell at their dinner companions. Not good for digestion! Please decide if you are a restaurant, or a dance club.  

2) Mediocre wine selection, which may be forgivable since they look they are more geared toward beer.  Its okay. Not everyone has to be a wine aficionado.

Good work Eureka! with a little tweaking, you could easily become a favorite!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Without a doubt, one of our haunts.  Most, most outstanding food... Beers?  No, duh.  Staff?  Some of the best.  We go every damned weekend.....if in town.  Order the Protein Salad, Brussel sprouts, fries, and, as many Hoppy Poppies as you can handle.  Go, now."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"This place was a really nice surprise.  I was expecting what you might think from food, mall adjacent - but this place is the real deal..... including the long wait.

     Just to add a little context, I have been living in Los Angeles during this whole ""Burger Renaissance"" (ie; super incredible gormet burgers everywhere for $15 and some of them are astonishing and some of them are horrible) not only that I have been a burger lover for a very long time.
    I had the Cowboy burger and it was really good.  Big but not novelty size, lots of flavor but not gimmicky, good fries and good service.

   As long as you can stand the crowds this place is a winner!  4 and a half stars."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Super great people and drinks and food! Been going here for a while now and I love it every time! 
Shout out to the amazing service at the bar tonight! Asta was training Jordan and she made drinks hella fast and good! The bartender Darby also was super friendly!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Phenomenal burger. Probably the best burger I have ever had in my life actually. 

The whiskey sour was perfect and the service was excellent."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The Napa burger was delicious! A bit on the pricey side, but for a splurge, it sure is tasty."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Loved Eureka! I had the bruschetta, Mac n Cheese, and a fruity light colored beer that my server Danielle picked out for me. I described what kind of beers I usually like and she knew exactly which one to bring me. Ask for Danielle when you go in, she is really nice and knowledgeable :)"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I come here at least once a week, and it's a great time every time. The staff is friendly, management is attentive, and kitchen is on par. And the beer selection?! Who can complain! There's always something new and delicious to try. Oh, go on Wednesdays for their Steal The Glass where you get to take home a branded beer glass. Highly recommend!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I dine at Eureka about once a week and it never disappoints. Whether you are in the mood for a burger, salad or a good happy hour, you will always leave satisfied. The beer selection is great and I'm not alone in thinking that their whiskey sour is the best in town. Menu highlights are the fig marmalade burger, cowboy burger and balsamic steak salad. Janine is the best bartender in town- I go out of my way to make sure she makes my drinks, and she's so personable and friendly as well. Charly is a wonderful manager, always going out of his way to make sure patrons are happy. At Eureka, if they even sense that you are displeased, they all go out of their way to fix it. For example, I have had a round of drinks comped  by management due to the slightest wait for our order to be taken. However, with such a courteous staff and the excellent quality and variety of the food, there is hardly a chance to be unhappy at Eureka. I would fully recommend to anyone without reservation."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"I stopped in at Eureka on Thursday, 10/17/13, between 8 and 9.  I was in Santa Barbara on business and wanted a burger and something good to drink.  A live band was playing painfully loud music, but I decided to brave it.  A host was standing at the host stand on the phone.  She looked at me but did not greet me or acknowledge me.  I waited.  She continued to talk on the phone.  A second host came up and seated two people who had been waiting in the bar.  I waited.  Host 1 kept talking on the phone.  Host 2 returned to the host stand and proceeded to fiddle around with menus.  Host 1 looked at me again but didn't acknowledge me or indicate to Host 2 that she should help me.  The place was busy, but I could see plenty of empty tables.  I continued to wait, then gave up and went to a place that was willing to greet me and seat me."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The friend I have known (minus professors) the longest in SB just posted a review of Eureka Burger a few days ago and as always it was a clever, precise , enjoyable review. 

I did not have a burger here last week and I have only eaten here once but I have to say my experience was quite different from his ""mixed"" experience.
 
Our server was perfect, just great, and I went there with the former owner of Live Culture in Paseo Nuevo, a foodie as well as someone with experience running /owning a SB place in the mall not far from Eureka. 

The watermelon/feta/quinoa/cranberry/walnut/spinach salad ranks in the top five salads I have EVER eaten in my life. 

My friend had the steak salad and he thought the meat was beyond wonderful. 

I liked the 8 dollar Pinot Gris he selected and the house red was just fine, certainly better than some other house reds. 

The salads were quite large, I thought, and I will soon learn how to upload a photo to Yelp to illustrate the sheer beauty of these two salads

The ""Riblet"" appetizer (osso buco flavors) is NOT to be missed. The tenderness, the seasoning both perfect. 

I have to say there was not a single false note or misstep but I will go back for a burger and see how it is. I know people who have had burgers here in the last week or two and been impressed. My boyfriend had a shrimp and kale salad--he works in the mall--and loved it.

The prices are excellent. These two top notch salads were in the 10 to 12 range! Appetizers in the 5 to 8 range (the 8 range looks large). 

For 2 for dinner, with three glasses or wine, two salads, and an appetizer, it was 60 before tip. That's excellent for quality food in a pleasant if a bit boisterous environment. 

One reviewer complained about 11 for a burger. Well, I'm not sure where she's from or if she eats out in SB but this is standard in a real restaurant and the originality of the salads, coupled with the high quality ingredients and the large portions, makes this a very reasonable place to me. 

There is no difference between lunch and dinner menu and for some reason people have a psychological block about spending money for breakfast or lunch when they have no compunctions about shelling out the equivalent sum at dinner. This is illogical. If you're going to spend 30 bucks for food and booze, why on earth should it matter when you spend it? 

People think breakfast should be cheap, but why? You have to pay your servers and staff the same whether they work at 8AM or 8 PM. True, eggs and potatoes are cheap as ingredients go but the ingredients have never been the sole determiner of a restaurant's prices. 

If you are used to eating out and go to fine dining some of the the time, you'll be thrilled with the prices here!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I enjoy the beer, the burgers, and the ambience. Great place to have dinner and spend some time with the people I care about. Very enjoyable."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The food at Eureka Burger is AMAZING.  You really can't go wrong with their burgers. For salad lovers, I say with confidence that they have the best garden salad with fresh greens, bleu cheese, and dried cranberries.  Their happy hour is also fantastic, great prices on beers and appetizers, those truffle cheese fries, oh my.

The only reason I can't give them a 5 star rating is the atmosphere.  It's always busy, it's always loud, there are always annoying customers being overly picky about their seating arrangement.  There's always a wait for a table and the table is never that good.  The bar is always crowded so even that puts a damper on just wanting to grab happy hour on a friday.  And lastly, the staff always seems a little stressed out.  The hostesses are always busy, ordering anything takes longer than it should (I watched my friend wait 10 minutes for the salad dressing they forgot to bring her with her salad).  

Overall it's a give and take with this place and the food is well worth it!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"My friend and I came here around 10pm a couple of days ago for happy hour. It was my first time ever eating at this Eureka location and I don't think I will be coming back. 

The service here was absolutely terrible, which is why I am giving this review 2 stars. The food was very average as well, about 3 stars. The waitress at the front table was attentive and kind, she immediately sat us down when we walked in. I understand that I came at 10pm but I didn't realize how dark and dimly lit the restaurant would be. I know that Eureka has more of a ""bar atmosphere"" during happy hour but geez please turn on at least one or two lights, I felt like I was eating in absolute darkness. In addition to that, the music was overbearingly loud, it was SO LOUD that my friend and I debated eating outside halfway through our meal. I couldn't even hear myself talk. After we sat down, we waited about 15 minutes before any waiter came to our table. All of the waiters (about 4-6 people) were standing near the back of the restaurant talking, no one brought us water or came by our table until I finally flagged someone down. When the waiter finally came, he literally paid no attention whatsoever to what we ordered and had to come back to our table 3 times to double check . The entire time we spoke, he didn't write anything down and kept forgetting what was being said. We ordered 2 items from the happy hour menu and another 2 items from the main menu. During the time we waited for our food to arrive, another party of 5 people sat down right next to our table and the waitress attending to them was their friend........which is great and all......but the waitress literally stood at that table for a good 20 minutes just giggling and laughing with her friends. When my friend and I asked for more water, the waitress completely disregarded our request and our waiter never checked up on us after the food was brought out. I understand that working the night shift is exhausting and that most of the waiters/waitresses here are college students but lets be real, you're not getting paid to sit there and chat with your friends, you do that on your own time. The manager was in the restaurant as well and I'm surprised that she didn't say anything to that waitress. The only person who check up on my table was the manager and she was very sweet. Overall, my first time here wasn't that great and the food is definitely not to die for. I don't think I will be coming back, I still tipped 18% though for poor service and I am starting to regret it."

NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Loved this place - went after a concert and was the perfect way to end the night - great food and great ambiance -  But I'm giving this place 5 stars because of our server - Edrick - rather than just take our order and move on - he was engaging and entertaining and made our dinner more enjoyable - after our order he recommended the ribblets  - I was a little unsure at first, but these things were amazing. make sure to save room for desert and get the Rum Pudding was just amazing!!! -"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Came here while staying in town for a week and had the best bar service I've ever experienced at Eureka . The bartenders recommended one of the best cocktails I've ever had the wild child and they were extremely friendly. The Eureka burger was amazing!!! Napoleon/ Napy was extremely helpful and gave us great service! Thank you and will be back because of this!
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,I'm giving this place because I love burgers but goddamn can we get better service please¿! I enjoy their happy hour but I don't enjoy sitting at the bar with a empty glass for 15 minutes when I see the bartenders looking at the glass. Not cool.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Amazing Gourmet Burgers, the flavor's are amazing!  I definitely recommend going, you will not be disappointed! And the beer selection is awesome! It's definitely going to become a regular pit stop for me."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Beer selection pretty good.  Service was fine .
Burger was fine the chicken sliders are awesome.
Good place to grab a bite when you are at the mall."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Just ate here for the first time. They have a very nice patio area wrapping around, facing inside the mall at the front and then out onto the road at the side. The Patio is dog friendly and we were able to easily tie our dogs up to the chairs. The woman who seated us also promptly came back with a water bowl and treats for the dogs. My wife and I both had burgers. I had the Jalapeno Egg Burger and she had the Fig Burger. Both were exceptional (I had about a quarter of hers at the end). The toppings were good but it was really the patty itself that made the burgers stand out. The burger patty was clearly ground in house and the quality showed through. These were burgers that didn't need condiments or toppings, not that they weren't appreciated, the burger was simply able to stand up as exceptional all on its own. This is a $12 burger that makes you wonder if you are under paying. I am absolutely intending to add this to my regular rotation of restaurants I eat at."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,i've had many burgers in my lifetime - this is up there. the jalapeno egg burger is worth the trip alone. pair it with some eureka truffle fries and one of their many excellent beers on tap and you're good to go. went here with a big group of friends on vacation and they were able to accommodate my group. i've been to many gastropubs and have been unimpressed - i was very impressed with eureka though.  this place is great and definitely not sloggy.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,This place is so beautiful!! they have indoor and outdoor seating area. Customer service is great and really nice atmosphere. I did not have their food but I tried their truffled fries!!!! All I can say is OMG!!! beyond amazing and I have to go back and try their food and their amazing truffled fries!!

The food is good bar food not bad but not amazing. The wine pour is the worst! The waitress said 7 ounces the manager said 6 ounces I'm saying 4 at best! Anyway I'm not saying don't go I'm just saying it's not that great"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"My husband and I go to this place for the good beer and the Fig Goat Cheese Burger. Anytime we try another burger, we regret it. The other burgers are average, but the Fig and Goat Cheese is 5 stars!! Also, it is very busy, but the service is good."

NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Best burger in Santa Barbara and filled with smiles both guests and staff.  

Super friendly hostess ushered us outside and asked if this was our first visit? We leaned this weekend is their one month anniversary. Keep it up. She suggested the Lollypop Corndogs made with Polish sausage. The menu was overwhelming with mouth watering choices. While looking, the 4 top behind us were having a hard time deciding too. Their server made a few suggestions and the order was in. Great customer service and knowledge of the menu. 

Now what for us?
Napa, Egg/Jalapeño, Cowboy or LULU all looked great with bison and lamb meats and the usual beef. 
Me Egg/Jap, sub rings. BOOM! The kick of the jalapeños and a more sweet than spicy chipotle sauce balanced perfectly. Ordered medium-rare. Food color. I actually ate it with a fork and knife it was so big and juicy. I'm not a larger-than-life TV host from the Food Net so it's ok. The rings were good and huge. I only ate one of three though. Too much food. A side salad for me next time even though it's an up charge. 
Her? Original burger with cheddar. Eaten like a pro with burger pits on her face as she dives in for each bite. Finger licking good! The shoestring fries were good but here too, a pile.

Beers rock. I'm sure they will change but if I may, please try the 90 Min IPA and Racer 5. It's nice to see a craft selection of brews and not the Curz, Miller and Bud. 

$38 for two at lunch is just fine when you consider the quality and certainly the quantity of food and great beer on tap. I'm happy to visit again. Maybe next time, Happy Hour and whiskey! Oh, HH is 7 days a week but only until 6 so tough to enjoy on a school day but this could be a perfect Sunday afternoon hangout from 2-6, discounted apps an watch a game at the bar. See you there friend. 

Thank you Eureka!"

NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I walked into Eureka! randomly while exploring Santa Barbara. It was such a great find. The beer list is the best available in the city, and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The Jalapeno egg burger is ridiculously good. You will finish it in 2 minutes and look down at your plate like WTF did I just do. Same can be said about the Cowboy Burger... Oh did I mention they have an awesome Whiskey List?

Keep up the good work guys, I'll be back!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Enjoyed this place! Have been here several times, and to the one in Berkeley, and the service has always been friendly. Love the brussel sprouts appetizer! This time I tried the Beet and Bean Veggie burger and enjoyed it. They have a good amount of variation/menu choices, and they can handle kids so I'm sure I'll be back."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Good service, and good hoppy poppy beer.. But thats about it. When John mannaged the place, food always came out great. Now he has been gone quitea few months now, the food has completely gone down hill. Ive eaten there on several occasions before deciding to write this post; however, after time and time again, my food has been horrible. Hanburgers always come out undercooked and everything else comes out completeky overcooked and greesy. Tonight i had an order of overcooked truffle fries and overcooked chicken sliders. (BTW the sliders were awesome until they chabges their menu about a month ago). Food is consistantly greesy and chewy. Only go there for the beer, seriously. One star for the beer and one a star for the bartenders."

We came in at Saturday evening when they had happy hour and we were helped out right away. I ordered 3 appetizers that the waiter recommended (nachos, chicken biscuits, and sausage corndogs) and not knowing how big they're serving was and i was pretty surprise. 

My wife had there burger and she liked it as well. The service was excellent as well. 
We will stop by again whenever were in the area."

NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The jalapeño egg burger is magical. Plain and simple. Osso bucco riblets? Yes, magical too. Had the sweet whiskey...pretty good and some IPA that knocks my socks off. Will be back again and again. New favorite hangout. 

Plus the design and decor is just awesome. Good vibes are here."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"This must be one of the worst managed restaurants I've ever been too. 

I went to eureka for lunch and a beer. Sat at the bar for 18 minutes and the bartenders kept on talking to each other without serving me. Then I called the bar tender and asked him if I could get a beer and a menu, he looked at me then turned to his colleague and continued his conversation. 4 minutes later he came to me brought me the menu and asked me what kind of beer I wanted to drink. 

He finally brought me my beer and walked away. I had to ask him to take my order. This guy was so into the conversation it took about 45 minutes to get my food. 

This wasn't my first time at eureka but it sure was my last time. 

There is nothing they make or have that you cannot get anywhere else EXCEPT for the horrible customer service. 

Do yourself a favor and don't go there"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Eureka has okay food, nothing too special to call out as a memorable meal, but it will satisfy your hunger.  However, they do have a great selection of beers and some tasty cocktails that are more worth your visit.  I would suggest checking them out during 'hoppy hour' for some discounted drinks and appetizers.  

The service is what confuses me most about this place.  There are always plenty of servers, but it doesn't seem they are assigned to tables, it is more of a group effort.  While I understand the method of having all hands on deck to help out, it makes it difficult to understand who you should try and track down for an order when they are all running around. During my most recent visit I was meeting up with a few friends that were already at a table, so I didn't expect to get noticed immediately as they were already taken care of, but it took a while to get the attention of a staff member.  I personally prefer one server to keep organization. 

If you are going to stop in, I suggest having a drink and trying to get an outside table to enjoy the beautiful SB weather."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Epic medium cook on these grass fed delights! I recommend the Fig Burger. FAB!!!!! Excellent staff too.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"First of all, a shout out to Terrence for an excellent job as server. He knows his menu and his beers, and is able to describe them intelligently.

We stumbled upon this place for a late night dinner after an evening of wandering around downtown. The menu was creative, and the place looked hopping, but not too crazy for a family with kids. If you have to wait, instead of giving you a pager or yelling out your name, the host takes your phone number and texts ""get your buns in here!"" when your table comes available. Sense of humor perfect for this family.

Didn't have to wait long to be seated, nor for our service. Ordered the veggie patty (beets and black beans--who knew they'd be so good together?) as it was described on the menu. Didn't want to eat the bun, but it was to good to leave on the plate. And so glad I upgraded to the sweet potato fries. Those little strips were lightly sweetened with cinnamon and honey, and fried to perfection. Seriously, I could have eaten another branch of those fries in the same sitting, without regret.

Husband's jalapeno egg burger made him happy, and the slaw side was delicious.  The kids got Mac and cheese (done with Alfredo sauce) and tempura green beans. Both yummy.

This place is busy and loud, but we were still able to talk without yelling.  Good menu, comfortable atmosphere, friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable service. We've since discovered that there's another Eureka! closer to home, and we plan to visit there soon. Hope that locale can live up to the Paseo Nuevo standard!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"The restaurant: We got a very cool vibe from this restaurant despite it's size: it's smallish and located on the Chapala side of Paseo Nuevo in front of CPK. The room is dimly lit, slightly cramped in spacing between tables, and can be quite loud, but that Friday night energy is definitely there, so I would say that would be the best time to go. We went on a Friday night, so keep in mind it will be busy and you will be subtly (or not so subtly) ushered out so as to allow for the steady flow of restaurant goers.

The food: I ordered the Napa Burger, which had arugula, pesto sauce, a grilled tomato, and havarti; I was pretty happy with my burger: it was original and flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the Pearl Street Blues Burger, which is their version of a blue cheeseburger with mushrooms; he enjoyed his, but preferred mine because of the originality of it. We shared a plate of truffle cheese fries as an appetizer, and my my my were there a lot of them! This is important to keep in mind since each of the burger dishes come with a side of fries already. This being my first time having truffle fries, I thought they were good; they have a bit of a rich and earthy kind of taste. My boyfriend on the other hand has had truffle fries elsewhere before; he liked them, but he says he prefers the kind he had elsewhere more. 

Overall, it was a very pleasant first time visit to Eureka burger. The  food was great, staff was friendly and diligent. I would probably come back again and try another one of their burgers or appetizers."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Used to be great.  Big portions of good Happy Hour bar food.  Now, small portions of least desirable menu items, completely overpriced.  Service was always bad and unprofessional.  Dirty bathrooms, wait staff mostly kids who hate their job.  All signs point to very poor management.   Corporate should fix this place; problem is, corporate is probably the reason this place has deteriorated so much from its promising start."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Came here yesterday. Wasn't impressed by anything. The guy who sat my friend and I literally said nothing. Our server only took our order and gave our check. He didn't introduce himself or checked how we were doing after our food was served. He however was more friendly to the table next to us which was literally a foot away. 

My friend and I both ordered the cowboy burger which was good but we thought it could use more bbq sauce.
We probably won't come back here."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,This place has pretty solid burgers. But they're definitely not worth the price you pay for them. I ordered the bone marrow burger and I just couldn't see the hype in them. Maybe next time I'll come for some drinks and appetizers.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"Still a winner with craft brews, smiling faces and killer burgers. 

Today I popped in for Happy Hour (daily from 2-6 and again from 9-lights out) thinking I wanted some Osso Buco Riblets for $5 along with with $1 off excellent draft. I was persuaded by the guy next to me after seeing his big, juicy, capable of a super model sliding around the hood of a white Jag while being sprayed down with water advert, burger. And the winner is the Pearl Street Blues burger with onion, mushrooms and blue cheese. Medium rare as it should be, it's liquid of love requiring multiple wipes from the cotton napkin. Lust at first bite. So it was good is what I'm telling you. 

My second brew was a choice pick from Great Divide, their Hercules Double IPA. Not my first time partying with this hulk of hops. Delicious.

With great selections of beers (love that the chick next to me tried to order a Corona) and scrumptious burgers, why would you now what to be the Duke, or Duchess, of Eureka!?

Jump and the deep end and get wet. 
Cheers"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Would not recommend... the burgers are subpar. I mean they were okay but, not an ' I'd be okay with paying $13.00 for this meal ' kind of way. It's way too greasy/ salty.?I used to go here often because my boyfriend LOVED their fish tacos.. however they ended up switching things around and what not, which ruined his tacos and they also took away the soup and sandwich I'd get  least to say we have replaced eureka.."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"Came here with a group of friends hoping to have a good time. We didn't receive drinks for 30 minutes. We waited another 2 hours for our food, only to see the table next to us get their food first. They were incredibly rude to us when we pointed out the lack of service, with a hostess continually rolling her eyes at us when we asked for the manager and our check. It's a cool place but terrible service with a bad attitude. Minus my one star that Yelp forced me to give them."
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,negative,"The service has been so slow and so poor the last 3 times I have been to Eureka I decided to do Yelp review in hopes that the manager will see it and improve service so we can go here again. 
We love the food....just can't handle the slow service.  
Am hopeful it will improve. 
Not sure if there is new manager but am sad that we can't support this yummy restaurant anymore!"
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,Excellent service and VERY GOOD FOOD.  Tried the tempura Green Beans- the beans were fresh and crisp but the tempura was a bit greasy.  I tried the watermelon salad and WOW it was fantastic.  My friend got the Chicken Satlimbocca Sammie and that tasted excellent as well.  Overall a very cute place with tasty food.  I will be back.
NIQWO-Q_F598XlAvZnFVCA,Eureka!,American,positive,"I have been to the Eureka burger in Redlands before and that was great.  This version did not disappoint.  The fig marmalade burger is really awesome, the whole thing is well thought out, and most importantly, I ordered it medium rare, and it came just that way (if I'm paying $12 for a burger, it better come just the way I asked for it to be cooked).  Every flavor has good purpose and combines well to make a tasty burger.  Fries are good too.  Good selection of beers.  And I do recommend the riblets, they are very good.  I wish I could do 4 1/2 stars.  Service was a tad rough, but nothing out of the ordinary for a place that just opened up.  I fully expect to go a few more times and bump it up to 5 stars as the service smooths out."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,It's UCSB move in weekend 9/18 and the restaurant was not staffed sufficiently to welcome and serve customers.  Came in at 1:11 and they said they had a limited service staff and for a party of six we would have to wait thirty minutes.  Unacceptable so we went across the street to Eureka where we were seated immediately.  Poor planning on the part of management.
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"poor service, they forgot to give us our pizza since we had ordered to go and by the time i reminded them we had already ordered, the pizza was cold. also be warned the thin crust is especially thin compared to most other places."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"This has got to be the worst CPK I've ever been to:
1) The wait time was much, much longer than what they stated. 
2) The dish I ordered was the worst I've had from other CPK's. My pasta was dry and lukewarm. 
3) The waiter forgot to bring out our soup. 

Needless to say, I would not return to this one."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Pizza is good, service isn't great and don't let them fool you saying that you have to wait 20 minutes: in 2 minutes I was sitting there, ready to order. The waitress, Traci, was pretty slow."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,We eat here often.  The service is great and the food is healthy and delicious.  They are always happy to modify any dish to your liking.  We will be back
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"OK, I am f originally from  New York and have traveled the world so I am extremely fussy when it comes to fine dining. This is not fine dining but so delicious.  I am not a lover of chain restaurants however, this place far exceeds any chain restaurant I have ever eaten in. I was fortunate enough to have been invited there on  Saturday after the  Solstice Parade by a dear friend who came from  out of town to celebrate . It was her first time in  this Santa Barbara  California Pizza Kitchen She wanted to sample many different dishes She was so surprised  by the high quality and diversity of the menu. WE ordered  many dishes to share starting  with the Maine Lobster Flat Bread , consisting of arugula  garlic oil, dill,,lemon zest, red onion and mayonnaise served on a  large crispy wonton. This dish was amazing - the fusion of flavors melted on my tongue in unison. I felt  as if  I was in The Hampton's or Cape Cod  eating one of my favorite dishes,  lobster rolls, only this was even better. It came with four large pieces to share.  We then shared a thin crust Pizza of artichokes and spinach and it was out of this world-- cooked to perfection.  It was so nice to enjoy the cheese and vegetables and not feel like we were eating just dough  It was light and lovely. Next on the agenda was a pasta dish of  zucchini ribbons and  fettuccini  and shrimp  cooked in garlic, lemon, white wine, parsley and parmesan cheese..This dish was excellent as well. The  pasta  was prepared  just as we ordered it--al dente  And the shrimp were tender It was light and we were not weighed down with too much  pasta  The vegetable was the main attraction.The menu offered many wonderful choices of: salads and  appetizers and main dishes. it was so difficult  to finalize our  order. What helped us was the expert servers and manager Angel has been there for many years we were told  we were fortunate enough to have him  attend to our table, And Beau, was equally as great The Manager has been there for over ten years, what a testament of loyalty and great achievement  He also helped explain the different dishes to us in great detail. His name is Kevin Secky. He helped us decide which deserts to order as well.  We  look forward to retuning another time to sample some other alternatives. Perhaps for my Birthday in July ,as they offer a free Sunday to the person celebrating their Birthday .Talking about deserts we had our final  splurge, we each had an amazing one and shared them also. My friend ordered one  of  the most popular ones there - the manager told us - the butter cake- served with vanilla ice-cream on top of  and whipped cream formed like billowy  clouds all around the plate. I bit into it and it tasted like I was dancing on a carousel.  He told us some people come there just for this divine desert.  I ordered the red velvet cake sitting on top of vanilla cream  with white chocolate, shavings all along the back .The cake was so light and fluffy and the cream cheese iceing was incredibly delicious. The entire cake was so large we had to take half of it home.  We thoroughly enjoyed it the next day, as we did  all our leftovers. We looked around and others were enjoying their selections as well. Many were having wine that was paired  especially for  the dishes. I had iced tea and it was never  left  empty. My friend had a mango drink she enjoyed. The other manager who is also helpful is Michele Jones  She has been there the longest and treats the restaurant like it is her very own I was told.  And The manager from Ventura fills in sometimes- Molly --and she  was there and attentive to us .   And you are greeted from  the moment you walk in by the charming  Host  Jack who says hello and seats you where you will be most comfortable. On your way out  he says"" goodbye ,have a nice day or evening .""  I know you will have a wonderful experience like my friend and I did at  The  California  Pizza Kitchen"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,Had an early dinner at CPK in Santa Barbara. Enjoyed the Moroccan Spiced Chicken Salad. The half size was perfect especially when splitting a dessert afterward. Their Belgian Chocolate Soufflé Cake with Ice Cream was quite yummy too!
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We love it here! The manager, Michelle, is always SO SWEET when we come, taking the time to make sure our experience is a positive one. For Mother's Day, she was giving out little gift bags. How sweet is that?!! The food here never disappoints, and our server Krystal checked on us often, making sure all dishes were great. Thank you for making today special!!!"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I love the pasta dishes at this location. I have always had great service, especially from chase! Keep up the great work CPK!"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Is CPK trying to be fancy destination dining, or mainstream chain food. Their locations in shopping malls, their mass marketing, their uniform service all indicate mainstream chain food. But their prices say fancy dining. Something is not right.

Single pizzas and salads are in the range of $12 each. When the restaurant is set next door to a Panda Express and Ruby's Diner at Paseo Nuevo - both cheap chain food eats - I wonder how CPK can compete. Yet, it's always busy. 
I avoided CPK for years, and it wasn't until it was the meal provided at a working lunch that I first tried it.  It's good, it's fine, it's definitely more creative with its topping combinations than other pizza chains.  If I had to choose between CPK and, uh, avoiding the Noid, I'll take CPK. 

I ate there the other day and shared the small pizza with one other. We ordered the mango chicken curry pizza and yes, it was good. But...couldn't we have gone to the local Indian restaurant, ordered a curry and spooned it onto our naan? It's the same thing.

I'll probably eat here again, but only after I've exhausted all other options, or if the company is paying."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,Wouldn't let me exchange my gift cards for different amounts. I don't see what the issue is here. The Mgr didn't even come out to explain it to me. Not happy at all! Don't get CPK gift cards!
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,Never come on the weekend. Slow. Staff simply doesn't care. Pedestrian food that is good with kids. This location needs management help.
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My husband, toddler son, and I and another couple and their toddler boy went their for dinner and had the worst service ever! It started out okay--being seated right away, being served our drinks quickly as well. But it went downhill from there. We asked them to put in a child's order for Mac n' cheese right away so that my son wouldn't be waiting. About 5 minutes later the rest of the order was taken and at the same time, we asked for bread. About 20 minutes later we asked about the bread again since we hadn't received it yet. 5 minutes after that, the waiter finally came back to say that the bread was being prepared. 10 minutes after that...both of the boys were getting very restless and hungry. We asked the waiter about when the mac n cheese order would arrive...he ended up giving us a blank stare and ""oops I forgot to place the order"" look on his face. At about the same time, a table of 4 who came in about 15 minutes after we did were served their food. We finally walked over to where the manager was standing and complained. She didn't even come over to the table to apologize or offer to compensate us for the bad experience we were having with this meal. She just gave one of us two certificates for free meals. By this time the two boys were crying and wanting to leave. The food came out finally and we asked them to box it up for us. That's when we found out that they didn't even prepare all of our meals!  And on top of that...we still had to pay for the full amount of the bill! Now, I'm a regular (weekly) patron at the Woodland Hills CPK, but I'm telling everyone I know never to go to the Santa Barbara branch!!!"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I go to this chain on occasion with other people, but I'm nor really a fan.  Pizza is OK, but there is better at most local places. They did have 50% off bottles of wine for New Years Eve though, so that one visit was great."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Haven't been to a CPK in ages.  I was expecting the tired novelty pizza menu instead we were pleasantly surprised to see many new items including thin pizza.

We had the Quinoa salad and a pear pizza both were good.

Service level was above average."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,Good Pizza place and I love their Pizza It's so good there. They have excellent service and great staff. I went here like 4 times with a group and 2 times with a friend Definitely coming here again.

TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,Good was great. We had the garlic fettuccini Alfredo with chicken shrimp and mushroom. Highly recommend it!
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Ok for starters agro Mexican guy with red eyes serving me seriously?  Buds at CPK? Had to ask for bread and he didn't even offer. Hair in my pasta! Told the waiter, he asks me you want me to get you another one? Uh no thanks I suddenly lost my appetite. Terrible service! After I received my salad my waiter disappeared. Oh the manager brought me my salad in a jiffy and said he was sorry. When I received my bill, nothing was discounted at all. Time was 8:00pm Tuesday 7/16/14 

Ok return to this restaurant a few weeks later The Stoner guy wasn't working there anymore and the service was a 360° turn around. It was a bit hot and stuffy in there and requested that The air-conditioning be turned on. Problem solved immediately. This time my visit was a bit splendid with better service and happier looking employees. Also I noticed the manager was really paying attention to what's going on in there. I'm upgrading my rating to 3 stars. The managements paying attention to customers needs."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Place is a lot bigger inside than I realized.  My brother and I stopped in here ... to be honest, I have two distinct memories of CPK.  1) The Twilight premier when I was taken here by the girl I was going with, and 2) a really awkward lunch with two people who weren't really my friends.

Thankfully this experience was a lot better than the last two, because I had always thought CPK was a good ""fast food"" option, and it was affirmed going here last night.

My bro and I were seated at a 2 person booth.  We were offered fresh bread.  Our waitress was really nice (don't remember her name) and attentive.  I really loved my strawberry lemonade I got, and my bro tried it and liked it too!

My bro ordered a four cheese and tomato pizza and seemed to enjoy it.  I got one of their seasonal specials, a curly pasta in a mushroom sauce.  Yummmm, it was so good!  My bro kept on stealing it from me so I had to give him some.

I was really pleased with the amount of vegetarian options that CPK offers.  It makes me really happy to see restaraunts who are willing to serve all kinds of customers -- especially having one of their monthly specials be vegetarian (and marking what's vegetarian with a symbol on the menu)  I know that, in the future, I will come back to CPK if it's an option in the mall."

At 8:20 we asked how our table was coming along and were told another 10 minutes. By then we were starting to get annoyed. So again at 8:30 we asked where our table was and we were told another 15 to 20 minutes. Our hostess did not apologize but only told us that is a Friday night and we are busy. Finally at 8:50 we were seated, a whole 75 minutes later, and while we were being showed to our table out hostess made a rude remarks to us. Once we were seated our waitress was very pleasant the rest of our meal went well."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,Love this place. I went with my friend on a birthday party. Please was little crowed but okay for us. Will be back.
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Came in on a Saturday night so it was a decently busy. 

I ordered the 'new' garlic chicken pizza. It was alright, at best. The crust was subpar, and it seemed to be mostly crust. And what else is there to really say? It's garlic and chicken. You can't screw that up! :)

My girlfriend ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza, on a 'regular crust' - as it used to be made before they switched to their thin crust. As our food came, they had made the wrong crust, and she was pretty bummed, so we waited for another pizza... Which she ended up getting once I had already finished my pizza. Not a huge deal, but still somewhat of annoyance. 

Her mother ordered something that the waiter had specifically told her was not 'spicy'. I ended up trying it... Although not 'spicy' it was definitely 'hot', like a wasabi hot. Definitely gross nonetheless, and again, had to get another plate of chicken without the sauce. 

All in all, pretty decent service for being a Saturday night. Food all in all... Meh. I'm not a huge fan of CPK. I've been here multiple times, and never do I leave feeling like I got what I paid for. I'd honestly eat at dominos if I wanted a better, more filling, cheaper pizza."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Come on! California pizza kitchen, they're everywhere. Service at this particular spot was cool. Young lady was new, but service was excellent!"

Now they have lagunita IPA"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Good food, but rude servers. On my lunch break and wanted to treat myself to a good sandwich and soup. Waited almost 30minutes to get it. When I asked my server if my food was almost ready he just said ""yeah"" and walked away before I could finish asking him my question. I almost walked out at that point, but I was so hungry I stayed. 2 minutes later my food came. Wasn't anything too special."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,I liked the manager's attentiveness. He was very concerned that we were happy and that we liked his food. And it was good!
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Because the pasta portion was tiny. Otherwise this place would have received 4-5 stars.

TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This place is honestly so great. The customer service, the manager talks to everyone and is so cool and sweet. Their entire staff is AWESOME. The food, is delicious. The buffalo sauce cauliflower and avocado rolls are our favorite. The cucumber revival and fresh brewed iced tea are delicious. We come here all the time because it's simply great. They do a great job here and should be applauded for it!! 
Also, 
Our server Greg was great :)"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I try to come at off hours to avoid screaming children and/or long waits for a table.  The food is pretty standard, but some of the drinks are pretty strong (particularly the margaritas).  Sometimes the service can be a little slow even when it isn't crowded, but for the most part I think the servers are great.  Obviously it isn't the place for a fancy dinner downtown, but if you're looking for something casual or you work up an appetite while shopping, you probably won't go wrong here."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Has very good safety protocols for preparing gluten free pizzas. Being a celiac, this is extremely comforting when eating out. The pizza was fairly good. My only critique was that it was a bit pricey for the size it was."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"They probably deserve 2.5 stars, but I'm an asshole so I round down. Seriously, I want you to ignore my review and go eat there. You need to experience for yourself how shitty their food is. I bet they served better food at the internment camps. The food in the dining commons was straight up gourmet compared to this garbage. The wraps were shit, the tacos were shit, the pizza was shit, everything shit. 

Have you ever played ""Never Have I Ever..."" Well, never have I ever wished I ate here."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"I've been a CPK fan for years but this was my first visit to the SB location.  The server was friendly and efficient but the food quality has gone down.   The Asian chic salad had a fake sugary dressing and the lettuce was so soggy and bruised.  The appetizers of dumplings were all dense bread with empty insides.   I asked the server 3 times to clear the table in between courses and she pretended not to hear me.
Sadly I don't think I will be returning to this CPK location , there are too many other great pizza options in SB with local healthy fresh ingredients."

TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Good experience and good food!

I've been to many and the SB location is one of the best atmosphere and I credit the manager and my server for a wonderful experience.
My 3 year old and I ate here recently. The server, Myrtle was attentive and on point for service.  She even got the manager to come over and say hello to us.
Would have been 5 stars, but I know it's a corporate restaurant chain..."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"This restaurant is the quintessential nod to California Cuisine--serving everything from a wide variety of salads and pizzas to burgers, hot and cold sandwiches and pasta dishes. If you think your favorite ingredients belong on pizza, they probably can get there at California Pizza Kitchen. Some local favorite toppings include barbecued chicken and goat cheese. And by all means,don't forget to save room for dessert so you can sample their New York Style Cheese cake or sit pretty in front of a standard but scrumptious hot fudge sundae. 

No matter what your palette is craving in the pizza department, you can find it here. 

Some words of warning, though...substitutions on pre-made pizzas and some pre-prepared dishes as I remember from a few orders are a little more than their kitchen staff can handle, so if you order a menu item rather than create your own be fully prepared to like it as large scale changes may not be possible. 

And certainly be sure not to stuff yourself as full as any stuffed crust pizza that they might order, as you might consider taking in the carefully crafted, colorful decor that is such a dazzling surprise for their diners rather than a made dash to the dark caverns of their albeit clean and large public restroom."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Special menu for us veterans on Veterans Day. I chose the BBQ Chicken salad. It came with warm bread and an olive oil herb dip.
Thanks for your cheerful and generous service!"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"It had been years since I last ate at a CPK.  I used to eat at the one in Burbank about 15 years ago when the chain hadn't expanded quite as much, yet.  

The bf and I met up  with friends at this Pase Nuevo restaurant last week for dinner.  (It was a stopover while doing some holiday traveling.)   I was a bit curious as to how the food would be.   I'd remembered the pizzas as being interesting before (if a bit weird.)
We ordered a pizza and a Thai Crunch salad to share.   

I liked the Thai Crunch salad.   It has way too much dressing on it, but it tasted nice (I'd order it again.)

The pizza, however, was a disappointment.  The texture of the bread was bland and uninspiring.  I could make better crust at home, easily.
I don't know if the quality of the chain has eroded, or I've gotten used to better restaurants for my money. Sort of a bland Boboli quality to it.

At any rate, we didn't finish eating the pizza.  We'd been pretty hungry.  As soon as the salad took the edge off my hunger, I was less enthusiastic about the pizza portion pf the meal."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My friend ordered a soup to go, and we literally waited an hour for it. She also asked for a cup of water which they forgot until she got up to ask again. A girl came up to us and asked what we were waiting for and pretended to care for a split second, and then walked in the other direction and completely forgot. I used to love CPK but I'm so annoyed that I literally never want to eat here again."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Corporate restaurant.  What else is to expect. I'd try some of the other restaurants around town first.  However, if you are craving good American food...this is not a bad spot."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My first visit was pleasant. Although the place busy.....we were served accordingly. Our second visit was horrible. Service was not up to par. First we were not given any bread for the wait, second our drink was not re filled and third I have to wait for my utensil. I will not be eating there again."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Every one knows about the great salads (i.e. Field Greens & the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped) and pasta (ie. Chicken Tequila or the Garlic Cream Fettuccines) as well as their signature pizzas (i.e. Pear & Gorgonzola & the Carne Asada).

But, did you know they are revamping their dessert menu?  While here this last weekend, our awesome waitress not only filled us in, but let us try one of the new items ... the Butter Cake.

The Butter Cake comes out super warm and moist with a very cold scoop of French vanilla ice cream melting on top, all surrounded by mounds of whipped cream.

I don't normally get desserts, but man, this new cake was very delicious!  I cant' wait until the end of June, which is when the new dessert items are official!"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"CPK is always a favorite of the family. Why? The choices are safe for the family that has different taste buds. While we were in Santa Barbara, we went to this particular one. Maybe it was the day (Sunday), and it definitely wasn't the time (3:00pm), but the service was just ok. It was seemed small inside, at least smaller than a few other CPK restaurants that I have been to, and the service was a little slow. 

Besides, you're in Santa Barbara, there are probably so much other places that are worth going to. ;)"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Me and the roomies went to CPK for dinner this past Saturday. We had a bit of a spinach and artichoke themed dinner which we didn't even realize until the waitress was like ""wow! u girls sure are spinach lovers"" LOL!

I was a bit annoyed at first because we went to CPK and put our name down and they told us there would be a 25 minute wait, so we went to Sephora to spend the time and came back 5 minutes or so before it was supposed to be our turn but then we went back up to them they said they had called our name 20 minutes ago??? That was pretty strange and so we ended up having to wait longer and the host person just came off a bit rude.. Anyway though, once we were seated our waitress was really sweet and nice and helpful so I would still say the service was generally good.

For appetizers we ordered spinach and artichoke dip and the crispy mac and cheese. Both were good, but we weren't too impressed by the mac and cheese things and probably wouldn't order it again. The dip was really yummy though! Then for the entree we got a thin crust spinach and artichoke pizza and I really liked that too! My roommates mostly ordered the food because I didn't have much preference but I didn't expect to like the spinach and artichoke stuff as much as I did. I like spinach, but have never been a fan of too much cheese or artichoke in food, but it was all actually really delicious!

This was definitely enough food for the three of us, we were completely stuffed afterwards. Also the price was reasonable considering! I've always loved CPK and this was another good trip :^)"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"good drinks but bad service, had to go inside and get everything ourselves. it was like lord of the flies out here, every man for himself"

TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Host took forever to seat us - not because it was too busy and there were a lot of people but because she was busy gossiping with co-workers. Other staff passed us by because maybe it wasn't their job. 

Be warned you'll eat with plastic spoons and forks because their dishwasher is broken. It's also a bit warm perhaps the AC isn't working well. 

Overall it's just not worth it. Look for Rev pizza around the corner. It's just so much better."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,My family enjoys coming here due to the attentiveness of the waiters and the food. But on our most recent experience the waiter was forgetful of our orders but was rather kind but her service was rather slow. My son ordered a dessert and it had a hair in it. Later on when we asked for the check they accumulated the cost of our drinks wrong and made our bill come out higher than it was supposed to until I caught there mistake. I was rather disappointed and would've just stayed home if the service was going to be that poor.
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Just got done with dinner and it was exceptional. Our waitress Cara was the best and did everything to make our experience the best possible. Not to mention the garlic chicken pizza and Chinese chicken salad were to die for.

Would definitely come back just for his service!"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Not a huge fan of chain restaurant food, you can really tell that it is mass produced.
Service was fine, food ready quickly, but I feel the prices really don't justify the quality of the food.
My salad was huge, but really anything other than healthy.
The pizzas are on the small side and the noodle dishes lacking flavor.
While this is a more affordable dining option that some others here, I would splurge and eat something better while in Santa Barbara, not worth returning."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"CPK is a great restaurant and the food was amazing but CHRISTOPHER WAS HORRIBLE. He was quiet and rude the whole time, he didn't know what the menu prices were or the plate size differences. Whenever we asked questions he wouldn't answer or said I don't know and told us he couldn't split our check and that he said he didn't have the time to come back to our table because he had other customers, really really didn't like Christopher but the food was great!"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,The wait was well over an hour and order was not completely correct. Good food and clean with somewhat decent service and refills.
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Good service, the management politely addressed my concern that my order of corn guacamole and chips didn't have enough guacamole, but I did have to speak up about it. Who wants to eat half their chips dry? My kid's plate of fusilli Alfredo was unimpressive, I'm glad it didn't cost much. Prices are just a little too high for what you get IMHO."

Worse customer service, when trying to fix my sons order on his pizza she decided to argue and say I know what I heard. We will never come back here for a family dinner. This not only shows bad service but bad attitudes for our next generation. It's sad to see what customer service has become to these days. Maybe if we were white we would get better service."

I get back to my Room ACROSS TOWN in fact the pizza looked aged and it was cold, called and spoke with Manager named Eric, he apologized and offered to make a piping hot pizza....its late I'm across town, Eric said their pizza warmer was working and not sure why the pizza's cold.  Eric asked how I paid, I replied a card, so Eric agreed to to credit back my CC for the pizza.

About 15 after hanging up, it dawned on me that I PAID CASH, I had Sun Chip, granola and salad for dinner! Terrible experience.....Check your pizza before leaving establishment."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"My experience at this location was very disappointing. We just walked away. 
I will not recommend this place if you like attention and professional courtesy from restaurant staff because that something you will receive here.
this is what happened:
We were seated after a long wait, restaurant was not busy.
Staff were busy discussing their personal affairs in-front of the reception area.
 At the table, no one prompt to take drinks order, which is customary anywhere i'd been.
 After 15minutes, we ordered beer and a diet soda. The carbonated drink arrived in 10 minutes, but beer never arrived.  
We concluded to walk away and leave enough money to cover the drink.
Host immediately came and said ""do you want to speak to a manager"", 
we just laugh.... and said ""we just want to drink and eat"". two things that never happened. 
NOT GOING BACK THERE EVER."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"We went their for lunch arriving at 11:45.  We were promptly seated.  The waitress came around about 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  We ordered our meal with the drinks and it arrived 15 minutes later.  Not bad considering the pizza takes 10 minutes to cook.

I had the Sicillian pizza, wife had the mushroom pizza.  One daughter had the 5 cheese pizza and the other had avocado egg rolls.

My pizza was good.  Crispy thin crust with flavorful toppings.  The crust got soggy in the middle half way through my eating it from the grease in the sausage, but it was still strong enough to eat.  My wife devoured the mushroom pizza.

We were in, ate at a leisurely pace and were out within the free parking time.  The kitchen looked clean from where we were sitting and the service was decent.  The place was pretty full when we left at half past twelve.

10-12 dollar entrees make this a place we won't be going every day but the do make decent food."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,This place was pretty good. Had their classic Caesar salad which was pretty well put together. For my main dish I got the chicken tequila fettuccine which was delicious!!!
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Good pizza. It does take awhile to get your pizza, but I don't mind it so much, because the pizzas are just so darn amazing. I tried the Mango Tandoori Chicken, the Thai Chicken, and the Buffalo Chicken. All of them are soo mouthwateringly good. And the painted CPK boxes hanging on the walls make such cute decor."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,"Food is yummy but pricy. Especially considering that fact that I can whip up just as good of a pasta at home for a fraction of the price. Hence, to justify eating here and paying a pinky for the meal, get the Jambalaya ~ ! Nom nom. It's been a stable of mine for the past.. lifetime. It's spicy, flavorful and loaded with all the goodness you'll ever want to find on a plate. Service is always friendly as well. =)"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"For a chain style restaurant, this is one of my favorites.  The bbq chicken pizza is always my go to whenever I visit a CPK.  However, all of them look good. Don't get a plain pepperoni though. You're at a CPK.  They're known for their unusual pizzas. Venture out and try something different! They also have very good appetizers and a nice selection of beers, wine, and cocktails. The only negative about this specific CPK is that they don't have a/c. Normally, not a problem, but I'd stay away on hot days."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,negative,It was lunch and when the server came he was playing with something in his mouth and spited on me. The waiter (pascual) didn't even say anything and i lost my appetite. I will never come back!
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Went to CPK for the first time since they remolded and got their new menu- and I have to say I was very impressed. I absolutely love how they remodeled it- feels much more local even though it is a corporate chain. All of the new options on the menu look  amazing as well. Our host was very friendly and knowledgable. Our drinks were constantly being refilled, our server was on top of it. I ordered the steak- and I have to say it was one of the best slabs of meat I have ever had. Literally. I think that is what I will get  this every time from now on  because it was so good. Overall  a very good experience. The only downside was they had to get rid of some of the indoor seating for people to wait. They were very busy and there was not a lot of standing room inside.  But I will defiantly be back soon!"
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"I was dragged in here kicking and screaming, but I needed to refuel from a hard day of wine tastin and shopping on State Street, and I am glad I gave in.

THIS is what the ideal California Pizza Kitchen experience should be like. 

- Quick, competent staff.
- Full glasses, with drinks that do not taste watered down and actually compliment the meal.
- Food that lives up to its name: The white corn/guacamole was very refreshing, the shrimp lettuce wraps were in healthy portions AND vibrant with flavor, the BBQ Chicken pizza.....  

...let me tell you about this. The chicken was moist and tasted quite fresh, not like stuff that was kept in a freezer for a while. The dough was just cripsy and soft in the right places that I like in my pizza, and there was no need to request extra cheese or bbq sauce, as everything worked very well in terms of bringing out a fresh bbq combination. Even the red onions worked added that ""crisp bite"" of complexity to the pizza. 

Make no mistake, this is not a gourmet pizza, but rather a simple but great pizza that works well. Everything on my Sunday afternoon was better because the meal my friends and I enjoyed here."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Ok so if you have incredibly high standards, I doubt your going to eat at a chain restaurant...
But I enjoy coming to this CPK. Matt who usually works the bar is amazing and his section is where we sit if he is there.
I am always surprised by people who eat out and feel it's a license to treat wait staff poorly, which is what I tend to see happen at chain restaurants pretty often.
So I try to be extra nice and forgiving when things are not perfect. 
It rarely happens here , but if it does , I treat the people respectfully and guess what? They happily fix it....

Today we had the rib-eye, a newer dish, and it was amazing. I am so glad they offer a meat dish, because sometimes you just want a good piece of melt in your mouth meat. The cook did an exceptional job on this dish...

We also tried the new pizza that had potatoes and egg on it ( I know WTF, right??) but it was very good. We would have it again.

It's great to see CPK thinking differently about their food selections because they were starting to get bland and boring...

Michelle, the manager, is always one of our favorite people there in addition to Matt...

We will keep driving the 40 min to eat there just for them..."
TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"Amazing experience from the moment they opened the door for us . From the greeter to the manager- friendly, helpful, attentive.

TUtf4FLtotdQDleYpRIfnw,California Pizza Kitchen at Santa Barbara,American,positive,"FIRST TIME. YELPING WHILE ENTOIXICATING MYSELF. Still on the premises outside. I've never done this. What is truly wonderful is that they have a choice of wine by the glass in 6 oz and 9 oz portions, believe me you want the 9.

However my highly educated palette is still intact and firmly acute: fully functional. Thank God for Android spell check. 

Excellent service. Always good food. CLASSIC BBQ CHIX pizza. Mexican Street Corn. Coppola Pinot Grecio x 4. Strawberry Shortcake. Flemenco show on my 12 o'clock. Great ambiance. Seated us fast.

This specific location is most definitely my favorite location. The manger is always very friendly and working hard when you see her. Gabby is a great hostess with the mostess. I don't remember any of the severs names but there's this one guy who's really funny. If the employees are reading this you guys can argue over who think it might be. Anyway, I love the food here. Although my only complaint, and this goes for every single CPK in the world, there is NO avoiding the god awful, horrendous sound of the silverware scraping against the plates. I'm so careful with every single bite, but still, the nails against chalkboard sound amplifies through my brain. I predict I will be deaf by age 29. But still, great food."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"Very good sandwiches + reasonable prices + friendly service = As good as it gets.

We found this place as we were passing through Santa Barbara.  We took our sandwiches and enjoyed them at Shoreline Park.  We had a great lunch, I wish we had more time.

If/when we're in the area again, we'll definitely stop in again."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,negative,"Why is it that the food that tasted so good during college just does not taste as good now? 

I went to this location of Sam's To Go instead of the one in Isla Vista (IV) because I was in the area for work. Walking into this location took me back to the days when I was a starving college student just looking for anything to fill my hyper metabolic belly. Ahh the fucking nostalgia! 

The menu hasn't changed much in over a decade and according to Yelp, Sam has been busy opening up satellite restaurants all over the 805. Actually, I lied. The menus have changed in that not only have the prices gone up, each location has their own modified menu. For example, I ordered a medium #25 on wheat, which at this Meigs Road location is a turkey and roast beef sandwich. However, the #25 at the IV branch is a Turkey, Ham and Bacon and the #25 at the Kmart branch is a Hot Pastrami. Go figure!

Anyways, the size of the sandwich appears to be the same and the portions of deli meat were generous - thick slices of turkey breast and roast beef. The toppings available are mustard, mayonnaise, peperoncinis, salt, black pepper, chopped white onions, tomatoes, and lettuce. I remember as a 20-something year old thinking ""Wow peperoncinis on a sandwich is fucking genius!"" 

Unfortunately, while the sandwich was large and filling, it just didn't have the ""wow"" factor that it used to. Peperoncinis? Even Quiznos offers that. A good Italian? Bay Cities has the Godmother for that. Thick slices of meat with awesome flavors? Langer's kicks ass for that. 

So forgive me for thinking that I thought this place was the best sandwich place. That rationale was simply a testament to my immature taste buds. I guess I can only compare my devastating disappointment as being akin to that of a dorky kid crushing after the hottest girl in class for four years only to finally go out with her and find out that she was placed on too high a pedestal... sigh...

Don't get me wrong, Sam's To Go is a good sandwich. Just not the best. It's a decent sandwich for Santa Barbara, but that's all it is - a big fish in a small pond. As for me, I'm crushing for a Legendary #19 with an extra side of Russian. 7th and Alvarado, here I come."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"I've been going here for a while now and couldn't live without it. Great sandwiches and so many options to choose from that you can't go wrong. I personally love the Hot Pastrami, and the Turkey with Avocado is amazing too. Great service too, as sometimes other sandwich shops like South Coast Deli are hit or miss depending on who's making them, but I've never had that problem here."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"Sam's to Go has slowly become my #1 spot in Santa Barbara overall. Sam is incredibly friendly and welcoming to his return customers. Unlike many sandwich places, Sam keeps his sandiwiches methodical and simple; no ingredient is out of place nor are any further ingredients needed. Everything is fresh and the bread...don't get me started on the bread. Freshly made all day everyday, and soft as well. You have a customer, thanks Sam!"
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"Best sandwiches in town/california! I miss this place soooo much. I used to live about 3 blocks from it so I'd eat there all the time. When I was in high school I'd drive out to the one in Goleta during my lunch break. Dry Salami mmm mmm good! The couple that works/own the one on Meigs are the sweetest people ever too!! I hope you guys never change this place! Thanks for feeding me the best sandwiches for the last 15 years :)
Hey I just noticed that the man I spoke of above is the man in the first pic!!"
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"Best sandwiches ever! I never loved the thought of living in SB for 2 years (you can hate me all you want) but this was one of the things/places that made me grow to love the city.

I used to go every Sunday night while I was waiting for my laundry to dry next door and order a #22 (roast beef with avocado I believe) with a small diet coke. The owner, Arash was always there and always greeted me with a smile and hug. He always remembered my usual and we would just sit a watch either football, baseball or basketball. 

The ingredients are always fresh and sandwiches quickly made. What amazed me the most is that after 2 years of not being able to return, he still remembers me and my order! So if ever you visit Santa Barbara, I highly recommend stopping by for a sandwich. It's worth it!"
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"Simply said: if you enjoy the mom and pop experience, you'll go here over Subway any time!  

They make a killer avocado, turkey, bacon, cheese sub!  And if you're hungry with a friend, make sure to get a FAMILY SIZE!  It's like 3 feet long and only $14.

The owner is a crack up: if he can't make you smile - nobody can."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"My favorite sandwich in sb. I crave it weekly. Same owners since I was a toddler; they are so kind and I still have fond memories of eating turkey sandwiches here with my mom when I was 3 or 4 years old. They use fresh ingredients and though it's nothing fancy, I haven't found a more satisfying sandwich in Santa Barbara."

The food is ALWAYS great. And you get so much more for your money. Real meat (and lots of it). Quality ingredients. My favorite place to get a sandwich."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"A small Mom and Pop shop, which are always a little more fresher and a little tastier than the big timers. This has to be one of the best sub sandwich places I have experienced in California. I live in Los Angeles so when I'm in Santa Barbara I always make it a must to come here. Must tries are the Turkey Breast and Tuna Melt subs, be sure to get the works."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"Delicious sandwiches! It doesn't hurt, either, that their service is fast and friendly. My favorite sandwich is the #8 cheese combination; it's filling and tasty, reminds me a lot of the Togo's #22 cheese sandwich. Yum!!!"
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,negative,"I've had these subs a few times delivered for Monday in-office lunch. The size and length of the subs is impressive and they're very fresh. Though some people are impressed by the subs, I find the quality and taste of the contents are so-so. Definitely suitable for lunch, especially one that you're not paying for but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Sam's versus other sub shops. That being said I'm sure it's a great, inexpensive option if you're looking to feed a crowd and they always deliver on time."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,negative,A local told me it was just like Togos. NOT! we got turkey sandwiches & pastrami sandwich. The meats were cheap quality and tasteless. My pastrami tasted like it  had been rinsed in tap water. The service was fine. The bathroom was disgusting and smelly. I wish it had been better. When you are traveling you hate wasting money on bad food. I go to SB often and will not be back.
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,Great service and the sandwiches are great ^__^ will be returning again.
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"For an inexpensive sandwich place, I've always thought Sams to Go was good!  Austin is soooooo right about the Mom & Pop thing - this is most certainly a family business so if you plan to come by frequently and don't want to chat, go elsewhere.  On weekdays after 5 or so, call in your order - it will save you 10 or so min of waiting in line."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"i loved this place when i lived in SB.  probably the best sandwich place around this area.  the turkey and guac sub was my go to.  but everything i had there was great, its hard to find good sub sandwiches on the west coast but sam figured it out!  cannot wait to come back when i am on the left coast."
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,"This place has really good sandwiches. The california club is quite good ! The service is swift and portions are big.  They also have outdoor seating, so you can enjoy the sun as well while eating brunch / lunch !"
-fxH1XplVLVtWg2ZJWwRdA,Sam's To Go,American,positive,Asked for a recommendation and got the #27 avocado turkey bacon with provolone cheese and all toppings and was not disappointed. Very satisfying.
ejqpFQ0dwO7AZhxTO9fySg,Bossie's Kitchen,American,negative,Okay so I'm confused why I paid for a $9 glass of wine. Weakest pour of my life. Literally took two sips and it was gone. Not worth it. The only thing that was remotely interesting about this restaurant was the fake cow on top of the building
ejqpFQ0dwO7AZhxTO9fySg,Bossie's Kitchen,American,positive,We love Bossie's kitchen! Everything from the smiling staff to the tasty food and family friendly atmosphere!
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"The BF and i were headed to the Italian deli next to Gelson's only to find the deli was closed... so we figured Gelson's must have something.  We walked in and it reminded me of a Whole Foods - but not entirely.  Gelson's carries some higher end, hard to find items, but a majority of the items are the same things you'd find in a Safeway (or Von's as it were... for So. Cal).  
So i'm not too impressed with the grocery items.  I briefly checked out their seafood section and it all looked pretty fresh - that part is better than the Von's.  For groceries and specialty items i think i will stick with Lazy Acres which is about the same price as Gelson's (but not for General Mills cereal)!  

We did get a sandwich from the deli section and it was HUGE - i mean, HUGE like you're not sure that a human can actually take a full bite of this sandwich - THAT huge, but gosh, it was GOOD.  We got the lunch special $8.99 gets you a sandwich and two of their sides, which is a choice of 5-7 salads, everything ranging from fruit salad to cous cous. 

One (huge a$$) sandwich and the sides filled up both the bf and me.  Pretty good deal if you're in the mood for a specialty sandwich and can share with someone.  :) 

Three stars mainly for the sandwich, but also happy it was there so we didn't have to look anywhere else for food!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"Very Overpriced grocery store that does not have that many unique items. Very Santa Barbaraish. I came in Tuesday and bought some over priced Sushi and asked the bagger to put all the refrigerated stuff in one bag , he said he did . I come to find out he buried some of my 9.00 sushi under some non refrigerated items . So it ended up being an expensive waste!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"Admittedly I seldom shop here. I heard great things about the Thanksgiving dinner, and I had too much going on to do the cooking for just 2 of us, so I decided to pre-order it, pick it up on Thanksgiving, and enjoy. When I got there, they had received my order, but didn't have dinner for 2. Would I accept dinner for 8 at triple the price instead? I was not happy, but it was this or find a restaurant. Then they were out of pecan pie, but had a display one in the window. I asked the manager if I could buy it. He said sure, went behind the counter to retrieve it, and then in front of me, sold it to someone else! That customer offered it back to me later in the store. Fuming.... The dinner was delicious, but partially frozen, and way too much. I ended up serving quite a bit to bachelor friends so made good use of it. Guess we'll try something else next year."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"I love that Gelson's has a Jeanine's bakery inside so I can get my pecan bars any time I want. They also have a pretty good cheese selection. I appreciate that they have specials on goods, especially butter since i've been cooking/baking so much. and especially since the special was on organic valley butter. i have to get used to going to such a big market. there are so many shiny (ie junk food) items i want to buy!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"It's clean and friendly, and they supply lots of ready to go food at the deli and really good sandwiches that you can order to make. I really love their pesto and spinach pasta, it's soooo good!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"My favorite grocery store in the country! The employees at this location are so nice, happy and helpful!!! I love visiting SB and this store is one of the reasons why."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"This review is only for the coffee shop area:  the coffee & Soy Chai Lattes are just well made here.  They have free Wifi, and a comfortable area to sit.  It's far better than the slow moving Starbuck lines and the service is always with a winning smile.   This top secret place will be so no longer.

Again, the staff is extremely helpful and kind (which doesn't exist everywhere in Santa Barbara)...service with a smile is five stars at Gelson's Cafe.  You'd be a fool not to come here."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,I love shopping at Gelson's because it's close to my house and the ready to eat items are always yummy and the salad bar is great. Im not to sure though whats going to happen when the bakery changes (so Iv heard.) I am a big fan of local products and support them when I can. I am addicted to Rori's Ice Cream and I always get it through the bakery (Jeannine's.) whoever takes over will they carry it?  I don't get why its just not in the freezer section with the other ice cream. ???
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"You can actually do all your gourmet food shopping here without having to drive all over town. Great produce,salad bar,deli,meats. Happy helpful employees round it out. It's very popular so I shop early or late in the day so I can enjoy browsing and truly enjoy this beautiful store."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"I go here to get coffee and my fav breakfast sandwich. However, the staff is very unfriendly, especially at the wolfgang puck express line where you get ur breakfast sandwich. 
Every time I have ordered it takes 5 min for someone to ask if I need help and the employees behind the bar seem like they are annoyed that they have to make it for you. I will admit the line is never busy and it probably is a pain for them to make my sunrise sandwich, but it's soooo good. It's just a bummer that I always leave feeling slightly guilty for making someone do their job."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"I enjoy stopping here when I'm in town and have a little time to kill.  I love browsing their fresh baked pastries, cookies and cakes, as well as their fresh produce and meats.  They have a nice selection of beauty and skin care products as well; I was really in a bind last winter with dry, cracked lips and Gelson's had the most amazing balm that I still carry with me and save for when I really need extra special care of my lips.  Their fresh flowers are fantastic and I'd recommend them for any time you need something extra special for a meal or a gift for that special someone."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,Both Jason's helped us at this store have outstanding customer service ! They both went above and beyond to help us when we had some bakery issues!!! We will be back :)
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Love these guys! I have been going there for 14 years...but moved and miss them!
It starts at the top with great management. The entire staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The produce guys always will give you samples if you ask. The friendliest place...love it!!!  Good job, Jason, Katie, et al!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Love, love, love Gelsons! Fresh produce, delicious deli, amazing cheese selection!  We love the Renaud's inside this location, the Almond croissants are the best I've ever had!!!  And don't forget the olives!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Lots of grocery stores are changing around here. I can always count on their produce if I miss the farmer's market. Never find a bare shelf/ missing item.
Reliable, never a long line. Coffee, bakery, deli and beautiful flowers.
In other words, every thing you need."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,All I can do is add my praises. Gelson's is the best locally owned upscale market in town. (Lazy Acers is the second choice.) Check out the Gelson's web page.
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"A+ grocery store. Wide selection including vegan/vegetarian foods. They sell high quality salon shampoos/conditioners. Food bar(expensive) has a great variety and everything looks delicious. Also, this store is very clean and organized."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Came in here to get something to munch on and use the restroom on a fluke since its there next door to a plant nursery. BLOWN AWAY. 

STAFF
Friendly and helpful

GROCERIES 
Clean, neat, organized, and FRESH. I thought Vons was great, but this place wins! The eatery/ ready to eat area includes Wolfgang Puck Express and  various healthy salad and hot food options (as  vegetarian I deeply appreciated this). They didn't have 2 soup options, but 6! And don't forget the freshly baked warm (about 6 inch long) individually packaged baguettes of which you can select from regular white or multigrain with flax seeds. The baguettes are on top of the salad bar, easy to miss but you'll regret it if you do! 

COFFEE/CAFE
Theres a coffee area towards the front to the side where you can help yourself. 

Gelsons, you're phenomenal and definitely set the standard for grocery shopping."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"I honestly don't understand why so many people speak so highly of this place.  There are always an abundance of staff making the shelves look neat and organized (so much so that it got in the way of my shopping), and the produce is shiny and pretty, but in my experience, no better than a Von's or an Albertsons (in fact, sometimes not as good!).  And, the stuff here is EXPENSIVE compared to the other shops in town.  I have to believe that this store is a force of habit -- of shoppers who have grown accustomed to Gelson's in SoCal, so it is a familiar experience in SB.  But I would shop at the Ralph's on Carrillo, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, or Lazy Acres before going here any day!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"I love how this grocery store carries local items as well as very high end, high healthy items. You are definitely paying for the difference from a normal grocery store, but the selections, especially with wine, cheese and meat, is fantastic. I enjoy the floral selection here as well as the bakery. Good grocery store."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Really like Gelson's! They have the rep of being too pricey but not so, they always have great deals.  Love their meat/chicken selection, and they have the best selection of organic kosher chicken in town. Great deli, and they have the widest variety of ice creams I've seen; you see ice cream there you can't get anywhere else.

Most of the people are friendly; some cashiers look at me like I just chain-sawed their entire family, others, like Jess, are friendly. Same with the managers; only one, Patty, was really really terrible, awful attitude, fire her at once, but others, like Robert, are fantastic.

The produce people usually help you pick out good melons.

Jeanine's Bakery is located inside the store but some of the people who work there are complete assholes so I don't buy anything."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Please note that my review is specifically for the deli service and food. 

Working down the street across from Whole Foods, one would expect I'd be a regular there. The salad bar and sandwiches at WF have repeatedly disappointed, so I find myself walking the half mile trek to Gelson's instead. 

The service at the deli counter is excellent with the staff attentive and quick to get help when a crowd starts forming. My typical lunch consists of a deli sandwich made with Boar's Head meat (excellent quality) with the optional 2 side dishes for only $8.99. The wide selection of sandwiches (custom made or their own creations) and the number of sides available to choose from (mind you, they are limited to sides that are priced under $9) really give you unlimited options. I've sampled a variety of the side dishes (pesto pasta, potato salad, roasted veg, beet salad, couscous salad, fruit salad) and find that I've been rotating through the pesto, roasted veg and fruit salads. Quality and quantity are excellent and I usually have a half sandwich left over for the next day's lunch. 

I do not shop at Gelson's regularly, but I am a huge fan of their deli and would take them, hands down, over Whole Foods, when in need of a *relatively* quick lunch."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"Overpriced overhyped wannabe Whole Foods. Save your time and money and go elsewhere. The Renauds in store is nice. Top notch bakery with quality pastries . The hot food section is solid but way overpriced. Other then some fancy sections here and there this just feels like a regular grocery store that try's to mask its self as a Whole Foods. Not sure what all of the hype is about, just an average store for n my eyes."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,Like walking into a twilight zone maintained by stepford wives.
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"I continue to shop at Gelsons.  I have tried WFoods, Fresh Market as well as Von's but I always find my way back to Gelsons.  Yes they may be a little pricier than Von's but the whole experience of grocery shopping is worth it.  Everything looks clean and fresh all the time.  The employees are always beyond helpful and friendly.   The sushi platters are fantastic for parties as well as the cheese counter.  They have lots of specialty items as well as your basic go to items.  Parking more often than not is not a problem and they are well staffed to the point that rarely do I need to stand in line."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"This is a really nice market. It reminded me of Whole Foods and Trader Joe's because of its vast offering of natural, organic foods. It's more intimate like Trader Joe's though. There's also a lot of local products (milk, ice cream, etc) which was a nice change from the usual Las Vegas markets that I'm accustomed. I walked around briefly to kill some time, so the only area that I really looked in detail was the ice cream, frozen yogurt, and gelato section. There were pints of local McConnell's, Three Twins from San Francisco, and Jeni's from Ohio to name a few of the small artisan companies offered here. There's also a Renaud's Bakery in the market, so it's a good alternative to their busy bistro nearby. I actually ended up making a purchase because my favorite Blue Diamond Brand almonds were on sale! Anyway, if I lived in the area, I would certainly enjoy shopping here."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"The store seems to have a lot of specialty items but I just didn't find what I needed. I needed chestnuts (the Christmas nut)  but what they had was not the quality I needed plus it was overpriced at $9.99 per pound.  However, this place gets four stars because all of the employees were super duper friendly and helpful. Plus there are many other items I'd like to try if I wasn't in such a hurry. I'll have to come back again and give them another shot."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Always come here with Grandpa to pick up some ice cream :) 

My favorite staple item from here though is the BORBA skin balance water (can't seem to get it anywhere else!)

-Friendly employees 

-Great Product

-Can't complain"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"My favorite and the most convenient place to go for Boars Head.  There's always multiple employees helping me or offering to help.  Their entire deli, hot food, pizza, salad bar area is really nice. Quality choices and some really nice side dish or picnic dish choices.  

We tried a spicy chicken pizza slice and a cheese slice. Really good. Too much parmesan flavor on the cheese for my liking but still delicious.  Some of their grocery items are not any more expensive than Vons but other items are a few dollars marked up.  I say, if you don't want to spend more than you have to, then go to Gelson's for the deli, bakery, specialty areas only and then stop at another place for your ""normal"" groceries.  

We also like Cantwells and Lazy Acres deli salad/side dish choices. But as far as salad and cold choices go, Gelson's is my favorite."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Made a salad to fill out with chicken and pork chop leftovers.  Fresh and delicious.  Romaine, mixed, microgreens for choices and other stuffs.  Behind it was a carving station - they had fresh whole roast turkey AND roast prime rib !!!  Amazing.  It's like a Whole Foods on steroids.  Fresh flowers excellent."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Great Deli Counter, Best salad bar around ! Top of the line produce 
No lines ! Love Gelson !"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Gelson's is the absolute best grocery store I've ever shopped in! It's clean, organized and they have a variety of items and a wonderful assortment of organic fruits and vegetables. The staff are always helpful and polite. I've ordered Thanksgiving dinners and party platters from their service deli and they really can't be beat. They have a wonderful selection of cheeses and a really fresh seafood & sushi bar. Gelson's is a bit on the pricey side, but I truly believe you get what you pay for when you're shopping there."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,Such a great store have just recently moved back to SB and so happy to shop at Gelsons. Such a great cheese selection! Great healthy food selection.
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Excellent quality foods at top shelf prices.  It's expensive, yes, but they have great stuff that no one else does, like Ba-Tempte Half Sour pickles and the Sonoma Brinery pickles (I am very serious about my pickles).  They also carry the elusive Wolfgang Puck's Caesar dressing!!  There is an awesome bakery and deli there too.  It's worth the drive for me; I usually stop here when passing through Santa Barbara for the hard to find goodies and a yummy lunch."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"With a motto like ""to make shopping anywhere else unacceptable,""  they set a  high bar.  Having to control fat and salt in my 50's I figured out how to make pizza with a minimum of both.  This requires good dough.  Trader Joe's fresh dough is salty, does not stretch, and sometimes has gone around the bend.  Frozen dough (e.g. Bridgeford) has lots of sugar and requires defrosting.  Most recently we tried Whole Foods fresh dough.  It made such a bad pizza crust that my husband wanted to chuck what we did not finish.  I have tried making my own dough from scratch, several times, and am apparently untrainable in this regard.  Gelson's sells the dough it uses to make Wolfgang Puck pizza.  The dough stretches like a dream, is not too salty or sweet, is ready to use right away, and, when cooked on a preheated pizza stone, creates a crust that is crisp underneath and to die for.

The lighting is adequate. 

Rumor has it that Gelson's may leave SB.  Please don't go!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Looking for a cheap breakfast? This place had a delicious breakfast pizza (bacon, tomato, cheese, I skipped the ranch dressing) and sandwich for only $5 each. The portion is large so two people can share one."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"Lisa in floral helped me plan the flowers for my wedding in July and it was fantastic.  Not only was it super affordable, she was very helpful, always got back to my calls, and had great suggestions.  I would recommend Lisa to anyone!!!!!!!  Thank you!!!  We were so happy!"
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,Gelsons is great... it may not be able to get all its produce on time right now.
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,Both Jason's at this store have outstanding customer service ! They both went above and beyond to help us when we had some bakery issues!!! We will be back :)
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,expensive. but they have some good stuff you wouldnt find at trader joes.
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"The best part of this Gelson's is Renaud's bakery! For the bakery, I will rate five stars! And this is basically my main reason to shop at Gelson's."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"I only give them a 3 because there are many other stores in Santa Barbara that have better value i.e. this is the most expensive market of which I know in Santa Barbara.  That being said, their produce department is very diverse and kept up.  There is a Salad & Olive bar.  GREAT selection of deli meats and cheeses and there is a awesome independently owned bakery in there.  Gelson's price keeps me away, but if that's not an issue - this is one of the best in town.  Cheers."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"In August we were exhausted from house hunting and stopped in for a pizza--it was amazing!
Since we've moved here in Sept. we have gone back a few times and not once has our experience been the same. The bakers are brisk. The margarita pizza which was abundantly topped the first time now comes with one slice of tomato, a small dab of mozzarella cheese and a sliver of basil. 
I am going to have to find a Whole Foods.
I will say the checker however was very personable."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,Very conventional products. Love that they have a renauds bakery inside! The staff is always so nice; which always helps. :)
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"My official ranking of salad bars inside of markets in SB:

(1) Whole Foods
(2) Lazy Acres
(3) Gelson's

Gelson's is really just a step above Ralph's or Vons as far as fresh salads go. While I appreciated the inclusion of raw kale next the nutritionally inferior greens options (romaine, mixed greens, iceberg), nothing at the salad bar is labeled organic, so it's safe to assume that it's not. The nice thing about Whole Foods is that they segregate the organic/non-organic salad items, so you can steer clear of any pesticide laden ingredients.  

The rest of the Gelson's selections are standard--just a mix of veggies, various proteins, heavily oiled grain-based salads like wheatberry and lentil which scare the hell out of me. 

Also, the guys behind the bakery case are a little rowdy."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,Let's be this market!! It costs an arm and a leg but it's super high end and always where I go to shop for a party.
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"The store manager, Justin, is amazing!  Always super helpful and friendly.  It's by far the cleanest grocery store in town.  Fresh produce, a great selection of cheeses, conveniently located."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,positive,"I love Gelson's and shop there all the time. The staff is knowledgable and friendly and the food, fresh. I do wish they offered more Organic selections though. And If they ever decide to improve the hot case I wouldn't have to go over to Whole Foods. Maybe in 2015...?! Best grocery store in town. And cleaner and fresher than Lazy Acres. Gelson's is great, especially Rob and Jennifer and meat/produce guys. 
PS the Renauds inside is different-they have decent desserts but the staff is sort of unavailable and well, oddly flustered all the time and I dread having to pick anything up...it's all about them, not the customer. If they think they are acting French, they've missed the boat."
ghLjxj4HoSHdflBEz2lIqA,Gelson's,American,negative,"I thought this would be like a Lazy Acres, but it's pretty conventional - a step above Safeway and not comparable to Whole Foods or Lazy Acres. 

They sell Renaud's pastries, but Renaud's IS right next door and many of the croissants are only next door.

The sandwich combos from the deli do look generous, fresh, and delicious. Produce and groceries are pretty typical with a few exceptions of some unusual products. They carry a large variety of butter and gourmet butters. But at the same time, they don't carry any natural toothpaste, for instance.

It's pretty much a typical grocery store with typical, mostly bland customer service, but it's more local in that the locations span from only Dana Point, CA to Santa Barbara, CA."
jfRq1KtjEGyPoMo9HZVw2Q,The Set,American,negative,"Service is an issue here. It's as if the wait staff is not properly trained or just doesn't care. No water refills, no 5 minute check's or any checks at all. It's the little stuff they miss like mustard, like putting the right salad with the right order, like delivering ranch when I order blue cheese dressing. And then not returning. At all. 

Our waitress today took our kids order but forgot to return to take our order. The tables next to us went to the bar to order their own drinks and refill their waters. Wait staff was MIA. Last night we saw a couple walk out after not even being acknowledged for ten minutes. 

It seems the food all comes from the same place at this hotel, which may be a good thing as the food is the only redeeming quality of this restaurant! We saw a server pushing a cart with multiple orders to the restaurant and we were horrified to see that a plate of mussels was on the bottom level of this cart just inches off the ground and from his shoes, kicking up who knows what into this plate of mussels. 

Back to the food, it was actually pretty good as we've had the lobster roll, the chicken club, the fish tacos, a chicken Caesar, and the burger! The outside view is pretty sweet, and makes the mediocre service tolerable. 

And the $9 happy hour wine was also pretty decent though the beer selection was very limited. So three stars for you, 'ole restaurant hotel, but hopefully the new Hilton management can provide some 5 star training to go with their five star hotel and turn this into a five star restaurant!"
jfRq1KtjEGyPoMo9HZVw2Q,The Set,American,positive,"Great location, had the cheese board and cocktails which were delicious. Eric was our server and he was so charming to talk to. I'll definitely go back when staying at the Hilton because the location, food and service. The dates were also yummy and sat from 6-9:30 looking out at the ocean and palm trees and enjoying the evening"
jfRq1KtjEGyPoMo9HZVw2Q,The Set,American,positive,"Great knowledgable staff. Nice night time ambience as long as there is no wedding happening. Nice selection, and willing to accommodate within the range of their selection."
jfRq1KtjEGyPoMo9HZVw2Q,The Set,American,negative,"We  decided to grab dinner on one of the nights we were staying at the hotel. Chose to eat outdoors on the patio with its very nice oceanfront view including fire pits for evening time dining or drinks. However neither the food nor service were as impressive as the outdoor atmosphere and certainly didn't justify the prices. 4 stars for the attractive, outdoor beach vibe. 3 stars for the so-so quality and taste of the food and the below average attentiveness of the service."
jfRq1KtjEGyPoMo9HZVw2Q,The Set,American,negative,"Service is tolerable, water is tap not filtered (taste terrible) service is slow took wine away before finishing.  Sad to say 25 minutes later they return the wine? !? So much for busing clean up.  Not going for drinks again.  The server didn't know much about the house wine.  Did not have confidence in her abilities to Steve."
jfRq1KtjEGyPoMo9HZVw2Q,The Set,American,negative,"Slow bar service. 
Staying here for the weekend. We went down to the bar sitting area for a drink after dinner out. Our waitress didn't come around the table after 15 minutes at least. She came around apologized for not noticing us earlier... so we were then given food menu, and she went over to ask our order of drinks ten minutes after. Another 15 minutes later she came with drinks not for us but the family next to us. In between she was serving another family and came by saying thy our drink been made... another 10 minutes passed and there came with 2 EverLong (margarita)...."
jfRq1KtjEGyPoMo9HZVw2Q,The Set,American,positive,"My server, Dominic was our waiter Friday night. He was very busy. However, he was perfectly attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. We got the ahi nachos, the set burger and the grilled chicken club with truffle fries. So good I can't wait to come back!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"I can't say enough wonderful things about our experience here from the moment we walked in. We are from Arizona and came into town to celebrate my fiancé and his twin brother's birthday. The service was above and beyond from the moment we walked in. Maureen, the manager, stopped to check on us as we had gotten drinks and were sitting outside at the community table waiting for a table and made us feel so welcome. From there we had Joe as a server and he was amazing. The food was absolutely outstanding and they gave all four of us a free glass of champagne and two desserts on the House because we were celebrating birthdays.

The best part of our experience was when my contact started acting up and we asked if they had contact solution and they came back with a brand new bottle of eye drops for me to use so we could keep enjoying our experience. I'm pretty sure they had someone go out and buy it. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars! I would absolutely recommend this place for any special occasion or just dinner in general!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"First of all, the view from Angel Oak is gorgeous. I highly recommend sitting outside and going at 7:30-7:45 PM in the summer to watch the sun set. SAY YES-to the bread basket if you are not gluten-free. It literally tastes like some sort of sweet everything bagel bun with delish butter. I thoroughly enjoyed (and regretted later hehe). I got the special that night which is not a permanent menu item, chicken with coconut cream and veggies. It was unreal and cooked to perfection. My mother got scallops- she said that they were excellent and ""thank you"". I will definitely go back here."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Wow, just wow! This is one of the best dining experiences I (and my two guests) have ever had. We had dinner reservations on 10/1 and from the moment we walked in we were treated like queens. Brandon, the General Manager greeted us and sat us outside with the most amazing views! It was my birthday and he gave us a celebratory glass of champagne. I noticed Brandon with the other tables too, he's so attentive, authentic and passionate about what he does and it shows up with the rest of his team. Our server, Hallie was an ABSOLUTE joy! She knows exactly how to engage with the guests and made the best recommendations for appetizers, entrees, wine...EVERYTHING. She offered to take our photos with the beautiful sunset and was just so fun throughout our entire dining experience. Nanette, the sommelier, was also fantastic! She came over to our table and made excellent recommendations and she was just a pure joy as well. 

The food, the food, the food!!! My friend ordered the NY strip and said, ""this is the best steak I have ever had!"" She has been to wonderful restaurants in the area and this was hands down the best steak. I had the scallops and they were mouth watering!! My other guest had the halibut and she said it was perfectly cooked. 

You must go to Angel Oak. When I dine, I'm always looking for two things. The perfect ambiance AND food. I typically get one or the other. With Angel Oak you get the entire experience. Run, don't walk. You won't regret it!!

Thanks again Brandon, Hallie and Nanette!! Thank you for making my birthday so special.

We'll be back!!

Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Amazing experience from start to finish. Our server, Joe was excellent, super knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. I chose the salmon and my husband chose the filet enhanced with a lobster tail. So delicious. A beautiful setting, fantastic cocktails and wine and the profiterole for dessert was phenomenal. We will definitely return. Thank you Joe and Angel Oak team!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Wow. Wow wow wow. If you have to ask about the price don't come. If it's time to #treatyoself then get over here. 

Phenomenal food, outstanding service, and great ambiance. I was flying solo tonight and had the abalone and the vegetable side of mushrooms... great serving size and the flavors were insane. I finished my meal with the Candy Bar dessert- it was decadent and delicious. Amazing experience. I'll be back the next time I'm in town- no doubt."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"My husband surprised me saying we were going to a new restaurant for my birthday.  I had no idea that the former Miro, at Bacara,  had completely transformed into this open, chic modern restaurant. If this were in downtown SB it would be packed every night of the week. I cannot say enough about the food! Everything was excellent. The 6 ounce filet melted in my mouth and the candy bar dessert was worth every calorie.

Santa Barbara people, get out of your rut and be transformed by this new experience. We will be back! I just want to go hang out at the bar next time.

Marilee"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Loved the relaxed ambiance at the bar. Their New York Steak met my expectations but their Wild Mushroom dish exceeded it! I would definitely recommend the food, drinks, and dessert!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"If I could give 3 1/2 stars, I would. For starters, the service was excellent! I was surprised that the $39 filet mignon was literally just a 6 oz. piece of meat on a plane white plate, no garnishments or anything. (See pic) I ordered a medium filet mignon and it came well done. Right after I cut into it and took my first bite the waiter came up to me and asked how it was and I couldn't help but say, ""does this look medium to you?"" he quickly said no and asked what he could do to make it right. I asked for a new steak (which I never ever ever EVER do!!!!) they quickly got another one and brought it out, this time, WAY TO RARE! As soon as I cut into it they too, saw how rare it was and took it back to recook it. Third times a charm, I like to say because when the brought it back, it was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! like melt in your mouth superb! 

The French onion soup was wonderful and the desserts were out of this world delicious. I would come here just for the desserts. I think we got one of every dessert and they were all excellent! 

The ambiance was great! Loved the lighting and decor. Might not be my favorite place and I would consider this place about 20% over priced but still worth a visit... At least for their desserts and stellar service!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Great meal at a great venue, the only thing I thought was egregious and absurd was the $22 (for woodford reserve) and $20 (for makers mark) price for the old fashioneds that we ordered. Ok, normal cocktails are already $17 but the extra charge for the brand name bourbon isn't really necessary is it?

Best value: the vegetable sides are large portions and the lobster gnocchi is well priced at $14

Service is excellent!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"We celebrated my daughter's birthday with an exquisite dining experience.  Our waiter knew the menu in detail and was able to steer us in the right direction.  Everything was delicious and beautifully presented.  The steak stole the show.  The sauces on the side were a nice touch, as they didn't overpowered the dishes."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,negative,"Waste of money there are much better places in town that charge must less, I went in for a private party with some friends and family expecting quite an experience considering the reputation. As soon as we were seated I noticed water spots on the glasses, wine stains on the table from the party before tsk tsk. It was a 3 course meal providing 3 options for each course. After explaining that I have a dairy allergy the server looking very worried said they would make a quick dressing of oil and vinegar and the risotto will have no dairy. Thus began amateur hour, food runners coming out completely lost asking multiple guests at the table who ordered what ( which was the trend of the evening)...really. By the time I tracked my plate down after being offered 3 others , plain with out a single grain of salt or dressing with a few sad attempts of dyhydrated tomatoes again without seasoning some pickled onions...sad attempt for a salad. The time between courses was long much too long. We had to speak with a manager about it which didn't help. The main course I went with was risotto knowing I had called ahead days prior informing the kitchen of my allergy because you never make risotto to order. After the first very underwhelming bite I asked the server if he was sure it was dairy free and he said yes, I found out the hard way he was wrong. The dessert was a sugar bomb of no particular flavor... For a place of this caliber to be sending out dishes lacking of the price point is completely unacceptable. Don't make the mistake we did go somewhere else deserving of your money."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Came here to eat on Christmas Eve. The food was amazing! I didn't have much off the menu but the bread they have is fresh and delicious, the chili honey butter that it comes with is addicting. I ordered the jumbo scallops which were the best I've ever had, the brown butter sauce and pickled cauliflower balanced out the dish effortlessly. I ended my meal with the banana split dessert which is different than the original one we are all used to, banana foam with small scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, waffle cone pieces, raspberry sauce and chocolate pop rocks. Very good and very different.  Elsa was an amazing bartender and server and she definitely helped make my Christmas eve dinner special."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Great food, specular view but the service was not that impressive. Definitely worth checking out if you're in Santa Barbara. The ribeye with seared foie gras was my favorite!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"What an incredible restaurant! This was my third time here and it just gets better and better. First let me tell you something: this view is hard to beat (you won't get anywhere else). Even if you are seating indoor it's a scenic view. Service is top notch from the time you valet your car until your departure. The food is outstanding and our favorites are: the filet (you may want to enhance with the lobster tail), New York steak, lobster gnocchi, heirloom tomato and The asparagus salad. Make sure you save room for dessert: candy bar will blow your mind but if you want something not too sweet the apple one (don't remember the name now) it's delicious too! Clearly this is our favorite spot now. It's perfect for a romantic night or a dinner with friends (we've done both). Every penny you spend here is worth. If you are on a budget, come for the bar and get some appetizers to share. Otherwise, don't think twice, life is too short. Maybe we will see each other there sometime."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Finally made it out to Angel Oak after hearing so many good things, and have to say - it did not disappoint! Some favorites were the beet salad, the lobster gnocchi, and the dry aged New York steak which was cooked to perfection. CiCi, the sommelier, picked out a delicious local Syrah for us to enjoy with our meal and Maureen, the manager, was so sweet and made sure our first visit was excellent in every way. 

Besides the amazing food and wonderful service, the restaurant itself is gorgeous and has spectacular ocean views all around. Highly recommend for a romantic date night or celebratory dinner with friends. Will definitely be returning!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Good food, beautiful setting. It's a nice place to catch the sunset. We had an outside table which a gorgeous view, def romantic!

Food was good. They have gluten free bread which was a plus. Also, they served a some sort of delicious butter with it.

I enjoyed the tuna tar tar with the Santa Barbara uni. Shrimp cocktail was also delicious. But the cocktail I got was just ok, def not memorable and took long to get even though it wasn't too packed.

Overall, nice place. I'd go back."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Great spacious restaurant.  Service was terrific --- very well taken care of.  Food was excellent --- huge fan of their bread rolls, would go back just for the rolls.  And the apple cobbler dessert was so delicious --- huge serving, just wish we weren't so full otherwise we would have finished it.

Definitely going back.  We love Bacara."

Excellent Service."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"We had been to Miro, the previous restaurant on the property with ""Meh"" feelings about the food.  Angel Oak was amazing.  Cocktails were fantastic, and the food was amazing... along with, of course, the views and the service.  The scallops with Fresno chili was subtle but with layers of flavor, the asparagus salad with 4 minute egg was fantastic and the abalone was a lovely homage to truly local Santa Barbara dining.  Can't wait to come back!"
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,negative,"I very rarely write reviews and I very rarely, perhaps never, give 1 star, however this place is terrible. From the host service, bar service to the chef, everything was terrible which ultimately feels like poor management. The only redeeming quality is that they perhaps know they're terrible as they kept trying to give us free stuff to make up for the terrible-ness. However, I would imagine that most do not go to $$$ restaurants hoping for a terrible experience so they ultimately receive free food. 

Long story short, waited 30 minutes for a drink at the bar, 1 hour for a table when we had a reservation and there were tons of tables and then 60 min later hostess tries to seat us in an abandoned part of restaurant that was available the entire time. Drinks at bar were good but not even a ""hello"" from the bartender for 25 minutes is rude. Crab cake at bar was mediocre at best. Once seated, and 45 minutes after ordering, husband's medium steak was served rare and my halibut was raw in the middle. No asparagus. They dropped mashed potatoes to make up for asparagus not being ready. Fine but we didn't order those. Sent our uncooked food back. 5 minutes later they try to give us asparagus. We say we're done with the whole thing, and they offer dessert as you'd expect. Ordered baked Alaska, they poured booze over it and kinda lit in on fire but we had a puddle of booze in a bowl. 

Whole experience was weird. The hotel is nice but do not eat dinner there."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,positive,"Celebrated our engagement here.  The entire staff wished us congratulations at one point of the evening.  Very nice touch.  

We went in with high expectations, as it's hard not to ... we were very impressed all the way around, and Angel Oak did not disappoint.  Appetizers were all great to start.  The 55 day aged New York was off the hook, and my fiancées halibut was cooked perfectly.  Fantastic cocktails rounded out a great meal.  We chose the baked Alaskan for desert just cuz it looked so cool.  I'd have opted for a different desert in hind sight as it's not my favorite but we got caught up with the table side prep.

I don't really think it's fair to comment on the price of the meal here as you gotta be ready to roll going in.  We just sat back, enjoyed great service, and fantastic food and drink in one gorgeous setting.

One tip - sit outside!  Really added to the ambiance in my opinion."
Slg6Ec2D7vEBRmgVUfwkzQ,Angel Oak,American,negative,"The restaurant is absolutely beautiful, and the customer service was top notch. The views cannot be beat. 

Highly recommend the Petit Syrah by the glass and the Candy Bar dessert. The dessert was rich, creamy and tons of chocolate!!! Received a free corn bisque shot that was yummy. Fresh bread was next and warm. Our filet was average, twice baked potato was tasty, asparagus side had no flavor."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Loved this place. Nice outdoor setting, low key but excellent foodie experience. The pork plate was super yummy and all the small plates we tried were perfect."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Oh my, this place had the most interesting and unexpected items on the menu. We had a pile of appetizers and shared entrees and every single dish was incredible. They managed to make a plate salad fantastic and the bbq tri tip is one of the best meats I've ever had."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Hands down one of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara. Sunflower appetizer was out of this world and the tri-tip BBQ was the best I have ever had. If you are you in SB this is a must do - a culinary experience! Will be coming back many times with friends and family to share this gem.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"My Airbnb host had this restaurant as one of her favorites, and I'm glad Brophy Brother's had a 30 min wait which was not acceptable for my growling gastric organ.

The atmosphere was intimate and conducive to conversation. My sister and I shared 4 plates, one from each section and none disappointed us.  We're not big eaters, so it was just the right amount. 

The chef's plate is a must, I loved the avocado gazpacho with lemon grass foam. I didn't know what lemon grass foam was either. I suggest you go try it. There were so many nuances to each tasting. The beet salad and lemon basil ice cream were exquisite. The service staff were attentive and friendly.

It was our first food stop on our road trip going north on PCH to SF.  I highly recommend this farm to table restaurant!

Enjoy."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"Perhaps my anticipation/expectation was too high before dining here, but I give it a ""meh."" Two things that were splendid (hence the two stars) were the service and avocado gazpacho. Other than that, the lackluster California roll with a filling that resembled tuna salad with mayo, less than flavorful ""corn,"" and a much higher than average corkage fee equaled a $100 bill with not much to show for it except needing to eat some trader joes hummus when I got home. Too many other choices in sb!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Barbareño is a perfect combination of things I care about: brilliant execution, a deep love of all kinds of wine, playfulness in cuisine, a focus on local sources and tradition, and a relaxed vibe. Lenka has been our waitress three times, and her wine pairings are great; they don't just ""go with"" the dish, but they highlight all kinds of different edges and corners in fun ways. (It turns out she's also the wine director, which wasn't surprising given her deep knowledge and ability to explain things.) With that said, *everyone* here has been fantastic. The restaurant's unique combination of qualities place it comfortably in my top ten favorite restaurants on Earth, and if you love the Central Coast, then I hope it will find its way into your list as well."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Absolutely amazing restaurant!!  You will find dishes on the menu that might be a little outside the box but thats the best part of dining there. The whole staff has passion for what they do, which is so rare. 

Its now my favorite spot in SB!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"My new favorite place in town! Delicious fresh local fare with impeccable service.
A little pricey but work it"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I'm from Texas and definitely know my bbq and meats, but this hands down one of the best bbq I've ever had!! 

I love lamb and was a little sad they didn't have it that night, but was recommended the plate of pork and santa maria bbq tri-tip to try instead. Both dishes were amazing! Great flavors and sooooo fall off the bone tender for the spare ribs. I also never knew tri-tip could be so delicious. 

Also, we had to chance to meet Owen, the head chef. What a down to earth guy who is truly passionate about food and people! Can't wait to visit again with an empty stomach to try more!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Out of the park. 
Excellent Hamachi Crudo to start. Overflowing with unsuspecting and diverse flavors.... e.g. a slice of fresh grapefruit buried in the stack.
Grilled avocado was good but could be fabulous if the avocado was grilled longer and the black garlic reduction sauce was simply drizzled over instead of poured on.
Santa Maria BBQ (tri-tip) excellent. The piquitos beans were so good we asked for an extra side.
We'll be back!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Yelp never steers us wrong!  Amazing food, amazing service, Amazing night !  Thanks to our server Ryan for his immense menu knowledge and keen recommendations :) Our party of 10 loves to eat fine food and sip great wine: we were all pleased!  

Charcuterie, chefs plate, pork dinner, Santa Maria BBQ, Syrah, beignets, creme brûlée: we are it all!  Reasonable pricing for impeccable service & astounding food !!!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Light prep meal which are made simple pack that flavor punch. Heavy use of avocados in their dishes and it is said the 1st discover of avocado was in santa barbara and on this very same property barbareño sits on. I would describe the place as refreshing to the palate.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"I used to love Barbareno, but the past few times have been highly disappointing. My husband and I recently went and had an absolutely horrible service experience (among other things, weren't checked on-he waited 20 mins before ordering another beer from the counter when we could see the waitress chatting with another employee at the other end of the bar). The tri tip was good as usual but the starters, Animal Potatoes (over dried as if they had been sitting, too hard to eat) and Brussels sprouts (wayyyy too smoky a flavor) were not super edible. I'll wait to come back until I hear the service and menu are back on point."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,It was a little pricey but it wasn't bad... Great service... The Santa Maria Tri-tip was delicious
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Such a wonderful place to have dinner! The cuisine is southwest classic with a twist - inventive and interesting. 

Really, really enjoyed the service. Natalia is an amazing server - ask for her!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Our grown up son recommended this place after he and his gf had a fabulous meal there. 
This fairly new restaurant did not disappoint anywhere. Loved the decor starting on the exterior with playful unique catus flower boxes. The hostess was so welcoming and sincere. All the wait staff likewise were nice and helpful but not overbearing . Atmosphere was  fun and lively but not too loud 
We are visiting bay area folks who like to eat and  Barbarenos   didn't disappoint. In fact 
 food was better than most we've enjoyed at SF restaurants. 
Their tri tip is the best I've ever eaten - so moist , and flavorful and came  paired with perfectly flavored beans. We had a very good Turley  juvenile Zin that complimented the delious meat perfectly 
"" Cobb "" salad was their creative different version than the usual but so good.
Burger was very tasty as well . I was worried about the sound of Basil ice cream infused with lemon curd but even though it sounds a bit weird it was so delicious  I licked up every bite !
Can't wait to come back."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"We had an amazing meal to celebrate our honeymoon. Our waitress Tiffany was extremely helpful and friendly. We had the tri tip and salmon for mains and the movie snacks for desert, all were great along with our drinks. Would recommend to anyone in the area"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,We had a great meal here last night. I started with the Cobb salad which was flavorful and beautifully presented. For dinner both my husband and I had the tri tip which was amazing. Very smoky and tender. For dessert the basil ice cream was good. Not too sweet.  Will be going back here.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"We loved it. I highly recommend it for people who are adventurous and looking for something out of ordinary. 

It was a delight to the palate with fresh local ingredients that deliver a heathy meal without feeling overstuffed

Vegan dishes along with beef will make sure all your guests dietary preferences are met"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I am really excited about this place.  Went here last Friday around 9pm for dinner and was not disappointed. Usually new restaurants need a grace period before they have everything fine tuned but I was pleasantly surprised with my experience.  We ordered the Chef's Plate which was interesting and delicious! Mini BBQ chicken pizza bites, mini ""eggamuffins"" and fried quail egg I believe? All superb.  I ordered the Santa Maria tri tip which was tender and flavorful.  Service was attentive and I like the decor-- straight out of restoration hardware in the best way possible.  Cool bar area and outside seating. I will be back to try more!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,I am in the wine business and love good food which has been hard to find since recently moving here from LA.  Barbareno has now get me excited about eating out in SB again.  Love what these guys are doing from the food to the atmosphere and of course the wine list...
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"At last!!  Great, delicious, creative food.... excellent service.... friendly front desk.... terrific decor and ambiance without pretension and a ""scene""!!

Loved our dinner there..... will definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends and clients, and can't wait to go back!!

Well done!!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Oh my yum! I don't tend to an adventurous eater, but I was intrigued by the dishes and wow was I glad I stepped out of my food comfort zone. Ordered the Chef's Plate and the Hidden Valley Ravioli and every bite was super tasty. Definitely will be back and recommending this place to friends."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Scotch eggs- double order please! What a groovy little place! I hope they don't get too pretentious
Great service there, but a little stingy with portion size. I think the ambience they're going for is quickly unfunctional for the comfort of most people, offbeat location- they may have a battle to stay in biz so go while you can and get the eggs and tritip!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Fabulous find! 
Loved the menu. Farm to table.
Preston the Chef rocks.
We will be back."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"It was our second experience, and just as before it was outstanding!! Tremendous combination of flavors, exceptional service and knowledge of every preparation in a truly relaxed atmosphere.  I highly recommend a meal at this outstanding restaurant, a ""not to be missed if in Santa Barbara"" place."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"one of my favorite restuarants in santa barbara because of how excellent the food and service is. It is definitely unrivaled out here, they are doing amazing and I can't believe that people haven't had it before and how it isn't as popping as it deserves."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This place was absolutely delicious. We came here for dinner with reservations, and were seated immediately in the main dining area, inside, which has a nice warm ambiance. Our server, Lenka, was very knowledgeable in the menu and especially the wine selection. Because we had a party of 6, we got to try a lot of things on their menu. We had the Chef's plate (an appetizer sampler), which they were able to add more servings to because of our party size. I was very impressed with both presentation & taste. For dinner, I had the Santa Maria Tri Tip, which was the most tender tri tip I have ever eaten (and I've lived in California all my life!). The other people in our dinner party had the california roll, acorn tagliatelle, ravioli & quail, Everyone finished their meal and said they would order what they had again. To top it off, for dessert we had the Muffets Tuffets (chocolately goodness) & the Movie Snacks which included malt balls & popcorn creme brulee (YOU MUST ORDER THIS).

This restaurant is a great place to show off to out-of-towners & also great for date nights. I hope to come back again soon to try their burger which looked delicious."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Amazing food, service, and atmosphere. Favorite restaurant in SB right now, highly recommend!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"I gave it 1 star but it is actually worth 0 star for the food and services. The food was tasteless and the service aggressive. Its glory days have passed. With almost $30/ dish, we expected our dinning experience to be a lot better. But they failed us. 

Babareno is in the food industry, but they also forget that they are also in the customer services industry. Their foods and services were below the standard. 

My boyfriend and I came to Barbareno on our last night in Santa Barbara. Since this restaurant was recommended by a respected chef, we had a high expectation of food and services. 

The Chef's Plate appetizer was below the expectation. We thought the soup was good, but the rest was tasteless. Normally, when you eat prosciutto, you immediately know it, but we DIDN'T taste it this time. It was bland. We thought that the restaurant was trying to ""feed us"" with the eggsmuffin and prosciutto, rather than impressing us with their foods. 

And here is the best part. Our entrées were cold and also tasteless. We thought that since our friend mentioned of the BBQ meats and how delicious it was, we should give the entrées a chance. Oh boy, we were wrong. My boyfriend's dish was cold. The meat was somewhat warm. It was almost like it was left on the counter for 10'. Mine was horrible. Even though the pork belly was good, the rest of the veggie didn't go well together. I thought that the rest of the elements on my dish were just to garnish instead of being actual foods.

It was a very difficult decision for us to call it a day. Our server never came back after bringing us the entrées. It was almost like she completely disappeared. We asked another server to look for her and asked to talk to the manager about the foods. Ryan - seems to be the manager - came to our table looking very aggressive. He didn't wait for us to explain what was going wrong, but insisted that we SHOULD pay for the whole bill. We were very disappointed at his tone and attitude - it sounded almost like we were trying to screw the restaurant for free meals. We only had 2 bites of the entrées dishes before sending them back, but the restaurants said that we ate half of the dishes. It is very disappointing of how they handled complaint and disappointed customers. It took us more than 15' to be able to talk to the General Manager, and more than 30' to resolve the problem.  

After being back and forth, the GM said that we should paid for the wines, and the pork belly dish. We refused to do that since I barely touched it, not to mentioned enjoying it. We said that we would be willing to pay for the wines and the appetizer. We did that, and quickly left the restaurant. And our last night in Santa Barbara was ruin. Very upsetting."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Our first time.  We were celebrating our friends anniversary. They picked the restaurant and we were glad they did.  I had the Santa Maria BBQ (Tri-tip). My wife had the grilled avocado and crispy Brussels sprouts.  Both were delicious.  For dessert we had the handlebar semifreddo.  Barbareño offers healthy California cuisine, gourmet cuisine at its best.  Looking forward to coming back!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"I'm giving two stars instead of one because our waitress was very nice. 

We were puzzled by the limited number of choices on the menu, and by an entree called simply, ""Tomatoes"" for 18 dollars...If you're offering a smallish menu, with smallish portions, for those kinds of prices, the food better be outstanding. It wasn't. The two of us shared an appetizer,  each ordered an 'entree' (mine was a serving of 10 mussels) and two glasses of wine to the tune of $200. I'm not opposed to spending bigger bucks for a fine-dining experience. But this was not that experience. This was experimental, novice-home-cook, in need of more practice with sauce consistency, seasoning, temperatures and meat selections.

The space is lovely. I hope they can get everything else together."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Loved this place and our waiter David was so knowledgeable and accommodating. Decided to focus on ""snacks"" and appetizers. Snack was chef's platter, which had most delicious pumpkin soup, their play on Egg McMuffins and carpaccio. Our mains were their appetizers. Foie gras for me with pickled grapes and cashew butter. Delicious Hope Ranch mussels in a fennel broth for my husband!  No room for main courses, but had to sample the amazing ginger cake with candied lemon and coconut whipped cream!  Plus, David brought us a taste of their homemade Milk Duds!  

Came back and just as great as 1st visit. Entirely new menu with fall favorites. Ever had grilled avocado?  Delicious. How about a giant short rib more than enough for 2 in an Asian fusion marinade?  Everything was great and interesting wine list full of boutique California gems."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"We had a wonderful meal at Barbareno. The space is simple, yet beautiful with a view of the kitchen and the fresh herbs hanging from a rack just beyond the window. The smell of smoke lingers gently in the air giving a nod to the Santa Maria BBQ they are known for.

The housemade sourdough bread and salty butter is spectacular and we asked for MORE!

We tried the Uni Carbonara, the grilled avo and the Little Gems salad and all were prepared to perfection. I would order any of them again.

For the entrees, we had a halibut, the BBQ, and the mushroom veggie last. All but the halibut were spectacular. The fish was slightly over cooked and when we mentioned it, our server brought us a semi-freddo that was just beautiful.

We will be back!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great service, wine selection and food. We ordered the prawn appetizer which was not our favorite. The santa maria BBQ and fried chicken were awesome. No cocktail menu but the wine list includes lots of local favorites from wineries like presquille and Alma Rosa. Lovely atmosphere too."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Amazing new restaurant, every dish delicious, great service & ultra talented chef... Nestled away from busy, noisy state and funk zone... Highly recommend perfect meal :) BEST bread in SB, closest thing to pain poilane à Paris. Très très bon..."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Tried this place out on Thursday and had an enjoyable time.  Our waiter, and the other staff, were friendly and on top of things which added to the cool vibe of the place.  The restaurant itself is set up beautifully - great place for a date.  The food was different and inventive without being over the top weird.  We liked everything we ended up ordering.  Will certainly go back again at some point."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Surprisingly well hidden gem off the beaten path in SB.
Very tasty / refined fare.
American base with fusion accents.
12 hours smoking on the trip ... Yum!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great vibe and excellent food. I travel a lot and I try to find local restaurants as much as possible. 
Sometimes it's great, others-not so much. This was a surprising and wonderful experience.
Bar service starts at 5pm, dinner service starts at 5:30. We arrived early for our 5:30 reservation and took a seat at the bar. The atmosphere and decor was a mix of new and old with air plants at every table and fresh herbs drying over the kitchen entrance. We were served immediately and all of the staff were friendly and made conversation. We ordered the pork beignets as a starter. Before they could arrive, we were seated at our table. My daughter and I shared each dish so we could try multiple things. 
The meal: The BBQ pork beignets were served with fresh apples and warm applesauce. This savory version of a favorite pastry was delicious. We followed that with mushroom bisque. It was dark, thick, and fantastic. It was topped with bits of crunchy croutons and small fresh flowers. It was my favorite part of the meal!  Our main course was the tri tip. (Much more eloquently named in the menu but I can't remember). Again excellent. To finish we had their house-made coffee ice cream topped with cinnamon croutons and warm vanilla sauce. Wow!
This is a definite 5 star experience. I will dine here whenever my travels bring me near this area, which I hope is frequently. 
Great job guys!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,My family was visiting Santa Barbara for the week and we wanted to try some good restaurants. Barbareño is exactly what Santa Barbara needs! I come here about once or twice a month and I have never had a meal this good. There were 7 if us and we had 5 different appetizers and 7 mains. The service was wonderful and helpful in choosing wines and beers. The chambongs were such a fun start!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This was an unbelievable dining experience! We dined with our family of 7 and everyone left satisfied. The grilled avocado and especial starters were delicious. For my main course, I had the black cod in a miso-soy broth that was perfectly prepared. Every dish was a work of art and highlighted the local, fresh flavors. The staff was friendly and very helpful with their suggestions. For a fun start to the meal - try the chambong!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"Nice busy ambience and notable wine list. The food is good but overpriced.

Get the tri-tip, worth the price. The Chef's Plate was interesting but not substantial. Not a big fan of their desserts either."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Beautiful and delicious food. Beautiful aesthetic. Everything was so intentional and lovely. What really stood out above it all was the service. Everyone was so friendly and open about their love of their place and went out of our their way to make our dinner a great and delicious experience.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Truly wonderful food. The blackened cod was melt-in-your-mouth creamy, the grilled avocado decadent, and the smoked brussels sprouts delicious. Paid $66 with tip, but easily a $100 meal!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"You have to try the Brussel Sprouts!  My grown up daughter hates Brussel Sprouts! I hate Brussel Sprouts and yet, we were all fighting over every last morsel. This place is fabulous. The Tri Tip and Pork were perfect. Flavors, tenderness, uniqueness and service were on a full display of worthy 5 stars. I hope you enjoy as much as I did."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"We had an amazing 2nd dinner here, wish we'd had room for more. We had a lovely table in their cute outdoor patio and an amazing server who took his time to explain the menu and each dish that was served and guide us through our choices. At his suggestion we started with the bacon date bao buns and WOW! My husband wanted to order more, but I really wanted to explore the menu more. After all the reviews we knew we had to try the Santa Maria BBQ and it did not disappoint! We finished the evening with two unique desserts the Baked California for my hubby, he loved it but I'm not a fan of hemp flavors so it wasn't for me. I had the Eucalyptus and it was delicious, creative and totally unique..exactly what I love in a dessert! Overall it was a lovely evening and we will definitely be back on our next visit to Santa Barbara."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Went in for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised to see how different it was than most restaurants in town. I love their earthy, Eco-friendly set up! We started with the Chefs plate and that was just out of this world!! My favorite were the beef tarts. For our main dish we got the Black Raviolo, it was good, but not my favorite. My boyfriend got the Plate of Pork and that was AMAZING, the meat was so tender! Best meat I've eaten in a looong time! Desert..WOW! Eucalyptuse ice cream was soo different but delicious. Overall we had a great experience! The staff was super friendly, and attended to our every needs! We are going back again for sure!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Dragged my parents here so that they could enjoy their beautiful patio/would pay for everything.

Service & atmosphere: as other reviewers show, the outdoor patio is adorable with lots of cute touches like lights, blankets, and succulents (intagrammers, eat your heart out). Temperature was perfect and the servers were very attentive, moving heaters proactively without even asking. Food service was also impeccable. 

Food: To start, we split the grilled avocado with liquid aminos, horseradish, and chili. I dont even know what the avocado was on top of, but the puree bed tasted amazing. The avocados themselves make me want to grill everything from now on as well. I tried the famed short rib which was juicy, flavorful, and i wish i had a whole rack. I had the santa maria bbq, which was well cooked though not as flavorful and rich as I was hoping (also, a lot of pinquito beans. Like, more beans than meat on the plate for all you bean lovers). 

Though not my top SB restaurant choice, dinner was completely delicious with an admirable local-SB mission and a definitely good choice if someone else pays."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,This place is one of my top three go to restaurants in Santa Barbara. Always fresh and consistent. The staff is top notch and the owners are working side by side with their employees. You know the service is going to be excellent.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"I am so sorry to have to write this review.  Barbareno used to be my favorite restaurant in SB.  I took friends from all over the world there, and they were always amazed at the innovation, freshness of the food and the fun team of staff.  But no longer.

I have been twice in the last month and both times the food has been overcooked and dried out on service.  This last time, one of the key ingredients was 'missing' (we just ran out) and they promised to 'give you a piece next time you are in'!!! Really?!  If I order a dish, I expect it to have all of the parts on the day I eat it... not a month or two later!

They have also taken some of the favorites off the menu - which never goes over well with the locals!  I have to say that I will no longer think of Barbareno as a 'great place to go' in SB."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"My wife gave me a dinner here for my birthday, and it was just amazing... From the wine, to the scallops, the basil ice cream, and Tasha, the lovely waitress... Chef Martinez, You have a whole wold to conquer Sr... Gracias!!!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"The food is very tasty, the portions are ample for the money. Service is definitely something that I wanted to see, fast and not Intrusive."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Food was excellent had the Santa Maria BBQ it was to die for

Will make it a point to come back"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Wow!  One of the best meals we had in SB!  Sunflower salad amazing; chef's taste delish & pasta dish very flavorful!  They make their own bread & butter!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"The food, staff, and ambiance at Barbareño are nothing short of stellar. We hosted a small wedding reception out on the patio: Doug and the rest of the staff were extremely accommodating of our needs, with attentive, personalized service. The food tasted consistently fantastic, and my guests commented on the wonderful meal. I highly recommend the grilled avocado, eggamuffins, especial, market fish, and Santa Maria BBQ.

Whenever we are in Santa Barbara, my husband and I will definitely be back!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Just go. Close your eyes and pick something on the menu and order it and enjoy!!! The bread is beyond amazing. Staff is great. Just do it!!!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"I visited Barbareño when I was in Santa Barbara with my boyfriend last weekend. I was very excited to come here because I love the concept of regionally inspired cuisine. The photos on yelp and on their website also looked really nice so I thought it was the perfect date spot for our weekend getaway. The ambiance of the restaurant was exactly what I had expected. Very nice vibe and beautiful décor. 

I had made a reservation about a week in advance but I have to admit that I was quite disappointed by my whole experience. We waited about 15 minutes to get seated even though the restaurant wasn't even that full... and we did not even get seated outside which is much nicer. 

We ordered the panzanella salad and the oaktagliatelle to share. I specifically asked for the panzanella salad with no cheese but after realizing how slow the service really was, I figured it would be much easier to just push it off to the side rather than request a new one. The oaktagliatte was quite strange - we were expecting tagliatelle pasta with some acorn, mushrooms and other veggies (this was the only vegan entre option on the menu too which is strange for such a farm to table concept) but instead the pasta was made out of acorns and the sauce was extremely rich... I almost felt like I was having a soup.

Overall, I was not impressed by my experience at Barbareño. My meal cost me almost $60 and I honestly left kind of hungry. Ended up getting drinks in downtown SB somewhere on State Street and ordered some tacos."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Came here with some friends to have dinner for the 5th time and I have to say this place is amazing. My steak is always perfectly cooked and flavored very well. Our waiter was a lovely gentleman who was very attentive. They never fail to make our dinner experience satisfying!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Excellent. A little neighborhood gem. I felt transported to Greenwich Village in NYC.

The staff is super great. The Som is super knowledgeable.

The food is fantastic. Experimental without being pretentious. I walked away feeling like I had tried so many new dishes and at the same time like I had had these dishes before. Fantastic place. Highly recommend. 

What we ordered:

Prawn Roulade
Melón gazpacho 
Local Black Cod (with curry) 
Santa Maria BBQ (their signature dish) 
And a bottle of Harrington Mission based on the soms rec."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"Sorry, they lost me at $27 for the Tri Tip entrée. Can I at least get rice too?
Anyone who thinks this is good never, ever had good Tri Tip. And it would cost less than half the price. 
Native SB folks know what I mean!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Came here for dinner with friends at 8 pm on a Friday.

There is nothing like Barbareño in Santa Barbara. The food is fresh, daring and tasty. The ambience of the restaurant is hip (east coast feel) and romantic. 

The restaurant offers homemade sourdough and butter. Both the bread and butter alone are worth the visit. As a starter we ordered the eggmuffins for the table. Each small bite taste like an actual egg mcmuffin. They're small bites but tasty. Would we order it again, not for $10.

The entrees were unique, tasty and worth every dollar. We tried the burger, olive raviolo, and Santa Maria bbq. The burger meat was wonderful, perfectly seasoned and cooked medium. It came with a tangy and salty spread, avocado and bacon on brioche bread. The side of potatoes was not impressive at all. The Santa Maria bbq was good. The meat could have used more seasoning but the beans were well seasoned and cooked. By far, the best dish in the table was the olive raviolo-fresh raviolo with an egg that you cut through to get egg yolk as sauce. Make sure to ask for more house sourdough to absorb the egg yolk. Dishes are NOT big enough to share. 

For dessert we had the date and bacon tart. Wow! Please order it. It's sweet and savory, 

With dinner we also ordered 2 bottles of wine. The manager poured us a taste of Refugio wine called Barbareño. We wished we had ordered a bottle of this one instead of the other two. 

Overall, Barbareño clearly knows good food. Wish the meat was better seasoned, the wine list bigger, more starters and kinder waitresses that didn't rush you. 

Stop by and try their food before they get too popular."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great place. 
- Hip atmosphere nicely removed from the State St scene. 
- Great service, hospitable and very knowledgeable.  
- Inventive cooking. Some dishes are definitely better than others, but the flavors and ingredients are never boring and more often than not they'll blow you away.

I wish there were more restaurants like this!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This place was amazing! We ordered the chef's plate appetizer that came with the mushroom bisque shots, baby pancakes with cheese and prosciutto and tartare. I ordered the raviolis as my main dish. I would give this restaurant five stars if the portions were bigger. Four raviolis for twenty dollars is a little extreme. The presentation of the food and the service was great."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Just great.  Don't miss this authentic Santa Barbara joint.  Try the tri-tip and you won't be disappointed!!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,This is by far not only the reason I would move to this city but the best food I have been able to enjoy in quite some time! I suggest to ANYONE AND EVERYONE to make this a place u must experience while you are in town!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,I have been in this restaurant a couple times and I have liked the food and services except tonight !!! I decide to have some quality time with my daughter before she leaves town and go back to school. The service was disappointing and I felt my daughter and I were ignored while everybody else around was been asked if there was anything else they needed. We ordered dessert and waited for over 30 minutes and the waitress did not bother to let us know why or at least just to acknowledge us. I had a very disappointing evening with my daughter !!! Yet As soon as I Cancel my order I was immediately given the check !!!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I made a last minute NYE reservation. Whomever booked my reservation was accommodating and although there were only outside tables available they had ample heat lamps and provided my whole party with lap blankets. Great waiter(wish I could remember his name) amazing presentation and well executed dishes from Foige gras to veggie options we tried them all. Wish we lived closer, Thanks for a memorable NYE!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I was walking by and the smell of fresh BBQ was in the air.  Now I've walked past this restaurant before on a Saturday and have smelled the wonderful BBQ but alas they were always closed.  Today as I walked by Doug met us outside and said you know we are ready to close for lunch but if you want something we will be happy to serve you.  Well it was well worth it!  My husband went for the tri tip sandwich and I the burger, both moist and wonderful.  GET the animal potatoes they are to die for. The patio is super cute, music is great, food is spectacular and the service is wonderful.  Don't walk past this gem on a Saturday and not stop in for lunch!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,This place is by far one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while. This place isn't over the top or too fancy. It's absolutely quaint and everything they do is very detailed and well presented. The staff was knowledgable and excited to explain their dishes which  made it easy to choose one! The presentation was gorgeous and the food was exceptional. We will definitely be back! Try the tomatoes if they are available. And the basil ice cream!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Best restaurant in SB by far. A great place for date night. Innovative menu that represents the culture and history of SB county through a food medium. Wines are fantastic (and local). Bread is off the chain. All entree's (that i've tried) were delicious, unique. A lot of heart and soul being put on plates here.  Call ahead of time for reservations"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Thank you, Yelp! for this excellent find. I was wandering aimlessly up State Street from my room at the Castillo Inn hoping to find a dinner venue. Unable to depend on my own judgement, I turned to Yelp! for recommendations. The favorable reviews diverted my walk to Barbareño, not too far off of State Street. Usually as a solo traveler I feel funny requesting a table for one, when I don't see counter / bar seating. But the staff at the front happily showed me to a table (outdoors like I requested).   The outdoor seating is great, the tables are spaced in such a way that you're not in the other diners' personal bubbles. 

The server was patient with my ""what would you recommend, this or that"" questions. I ended up ordering the server's recommendation (tri-tip), an appetizer and a glass of red. The food was great and the presentation was picture perfect. 

I appreciate Barbareño's menu options, its casual yet classy atmosphere, and price point. I will return on my next trip to Santa Barbara. I'd even make a special stop along the 101 to experience Barbareño again."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This is a really nice place!!! I love the Avocado Roulade, that is amazing! The design of the dining room and the restroom :))) very cool!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"We continue to go to Barbareno as often as we can which works out to about once a month. It is consistently the best food in town, the service is also the best in Santa Barbara, comparable to service at a 5 star restaurant in larger cities. Highly recommend it to anyone visiting or to locals."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Each course just kept getting better and better.  Tri Tip was best meat dish I've had in some time.  Really thoughtful dishes with surprising flavors.  Very impressed.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Barbarebo takes a neighborhood location to new heights.  

As you walk up there's some outdoor patio seating, and a Santa Maria-style BBQ a the end of the building.

Through the entrance lies a nice reception area, then a dining room that has a modern/casual vibe with wood plank walls and modern fixtures.  Nice bar if you're dining alone or are just are in for a glass of wine.

Wine!  They have an interesting list, especially for a small neighborhood place (this used to be a popular deli for lunch). The bottle list has probably 50 or more wines; with great local producers and good international alike, and there's always something interesting by the glass.

Much of the menu is centered around the oak grill... good array of small plates, though a little limited with big plates.  Looking forward to a new menu for the spring!

The people are great - very personal and professional.  You'll recognize then from the last time you went...  you'll see.

Do they hit a home run every time? Nope.  Who does?  But I've been there more than once, and every time's been enjoyable.

And if your really need a burger, they have one of those too.  :)"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"The fried chicken was the best chicken I had ever had. 
Every bite had a sweet flavor of caramel. 
The blue cheese grits..to die for! 
And the serving was HUGE! 

Doug was our server, and he complimented the food perfectly. He was very attentive and informative, and helped us enjoy our night. He also brought out slm complimentary desert, as it was our first night of our honeymoon. 

Very..very satisfied with the food quality, serving size, and great customer service.  Thank you for making our night special!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This place was soooo good! Favorite dinner from an 11 day trip in California. Grilled avocado appetizer was AMAZING as were the Egamuffins and Especial. Santa Maria BBQ entree was unreal!!!! So good and super fun atmosphere, can't recommend highly enough:)"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,This place is so unique. Refreshing decor and well thought out offerings. Most everything is local and presented with great pride. You can't go wrong ordering anything here. We pulled up and the aroma from the tri-tip smoker just drew us right in. Lovely alfresco dining area. I love supporting local people/producers.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Fantastic! One of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara! Everything we ate was truly divine. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable - be sure to ask about everything you are eating... where it comes from, how it is grown/made. The eggamuffins are out of this world! Ditto for the huitlacoche and mini corn tartine!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"While I really enjoyed the food while I was there, I think it was the service that stood out the most to me.   Our server was on point, polite and really made the experience great.   No complaints here!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Took my girlfriend here on a date night. Kris our server was exquisite in everything he did, the food was perfect and delicious, and the ambiance was new and interesting.

Will be back again :)"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Second time was much better!  I dined here about 9 or 10 months ago and I was disappointed.  While the ambiance was romantic and the plate presentation was beautiful, I thought everything lacked flavor.  I expected more, especially for the price. 

I gave it a second chance and was impressed.  I had the chefs tasting which included the eggamuffins, avocado gazpacho (yum!) and the ranchero scotch eggs.  I was still disappointed with the eggamuffin but overall I enjoyed the dish.  

I also had the Santa Maria BBQ (raw) and the Santa Maria BBQ (main dish). The entire menu is locally inspired with the farm to table approach.  The potion sizes were balance and definitely not overbearing.

For dessert I shared the movie snacks (ummmm, double yum!) and the fried olive oil brioche, which was absolutely delicious.

The outdoor seating still has that romantic, rustic charm. And if you get cold easily, they offer you blankets and/or heaters."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I've had dinner at least 3 times now and it's always a treat. I like to eat at places that make food that I can't make at home. The avocado California roll is amazing. They actually roll the sushi in thin sliced avocado, which is definitely out of my home culinary skills. Whatever they do to the tri-tip, keep doing that. The flavor of the meat is gentle and smokey and the texture is just right. And last, the wine menu is the best in town. So many wine lists in SB are full of the same overpriced Santa Ynez labels that never change. I love robust reds, and each time I've been there, I have had a new bottle that was notably (I'll miss the Tenshen *sp?) very good. Next date night... that's where we'll be!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Went in for my birthday, great decision!

Went with a group of wine professionals, we get a lot of exposure to great restaurants, as a first visitor to this restaurant we were impressed!
Everything is fresh and made in house, stellar wine list to compliment the flavorful options! Highly recommend sharing multiple dishes to get the full array of what this restaurant has to offer. The staff and management were phenomenal, Barbareno exceeded our expectations! Thanks Jesse for being a great host."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"The food was good but not great.  Service was fine but not noteworthy.  For the price, there are much better restaurants in Santa Barbara."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Went here on a first date and I must say that the food was amazing. The ambiance was prime. Nice classy open restaurant and I love it. 

I'll def come back"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,WOW! Everything was fantastic. Literally drove by and Green Table was closed so we randomly came here and it was fantastic. Definitely get the tri-tip. It's better than any filet I've ever had. The smoked eggplant was superb. Cool outdoor seating with a lot of heat lamps. You've gotta go to this place.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Would easily consider this the best food I've had in America. This restaurant is amazing. It combines exquisite food with Southern Cal warmth. Think wild salmon prepared perfectly with beignets with pistachio sauce for the dessert. It's a wonderful combination of chic without pretension.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great! The bread to start is fabulous, and the wine list is strong. Not a cheap night out, but on nights where you want a nice meal with good ambience, this is a nice gem off of the beaten path."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"It was ok.  Super super slow service.  I ordered three appetizers and I think I sat for over 15 min for one and the other two came 15 min after that.  I didn't even want to stay for the main course. Inconsistent in service they provide to people around.  (Yes, I got got the short end of the service)
In regards to the food, it was good but not spectacular."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"What a shame!  Since the new ownership and chef joined Barbareno I have given them THREE chances.  Unfortunately, I have been disappointed every time.

Today, a friend and I went for the new lunch they are doing.  It's a small menu, but we knew that.  We both ordered the 'fried chicken'.  Neither of us wanted a sandwich (with all the bread), so we ordered what was called 'fried chicken'.  Consider our surprise when the dishes arrived and they were sandwiches!!!

Anyway, we both gamely tucked into the sandwich, only to have it fall apart in our hands.  The reason for this was that the chicken was heavily breaded and waaaaayyyy overcooked!  No way you could bite through it in a sandwich.  So, we tried to just eat it with the coleslaw that was inside the bread, too.  Coleslaw really good, as were the pickles.  The chicken was horribly overcooked - and I mean horribly overcooked.  It was so dry it wouldn't have even made a good frisbee.

I am afraid I won't be going back to Barbareno.  It was such a fantastic restaurant before, but now there is no attention to the quality of the food.  Pity."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Finally, a great new restaurant in Santa Barbara. Nice setting in quiet part of town. I started with the ""Oak Tagliatelle"" which was really unusual but outstanding. For my entree I had ""Santa Maria BBQ"" which is a slowly smoked tri-tip and it was out of this world. Everyone else really enjoyed their choices as well.

Last place I reviewed is always full now so not sure this is in my best interest....but I want this place to thrive!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"serving lunch on Friday and the weekend, small menu but delicious. The tri tip sandwich was melt in your mouth delicious"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Excellent food, excellent decor and ambience, excellent service, excellent wine, loved everything about the place and every single thing we ordered was delicious! Will definitely come back to this restaurant if I am ever in town again."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Delicious food, innovative flavors, great service. Hamachi crudo, grilled avo, baked ca"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Why haven't I read anything about this fantastic restaurant outside of Yelp?? Off the beaten track by a few blocks (on W. Canon Perdido between Chapala and De La Vina), Barbareño promises to be one of our standard go-to spots. They have a long bar where you can line up and order a 'snack', as they call their appetizers. A nice glass of wine (generous pours BTW - not the usual thing in SB) and our new favorite tapa, their Scotch eggs featuring quail eggs and chorizo, would be a satisfying light meal any day of the week. 
For entrees, we had their signature Tri tip and a 'sous vide' King salmon. Both delicious, but we gave away our hearts (and stomachs) to the Scotch eggs. You know how first loves are. Thank goodness we had a little room for dessert, because the basil ice cream with the Parmesan cookie was amazing. Service was great, ambiance very hip. Ask for the outdoor tables in good weather. Only complaint - hard-on-the-ass wood benches and chairs - no contour, no give. Otherwise, the perfect hangout. I look forward to more tasting."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"The food was amazing!  We started with the appetizer sampler. Small bites of three of the appetizers, all bursting with flavor. Each dish is expertly crafted, you can taste the work that has gone into each bite. The recipes are complex and memorable. Every dish is served by a knowledgeable server that tells the story behind the dish, from the amazing homemade sourdough bread with their  own native soughdough yeast to the freshly churned butter. 

We moved on to the Sunflower Salad. kinda artichoke like, with a delicate dressing. It may not attract attention on the menu, but I highly recommend it (thanks yelpers).  I could have eaten two salads myself, the plate was embarrassingly naked when they took it away.  

After that we had the Tri Tip, incredible. The red oak smoke flavor was not over-powering. The meat was a perfect medium rare, tender and placed atop a bed of perfectly seasoned little beans. We also had the Burger, perfectly seasoned with all the trimmings on a beautiful brioche bun with a garlic aoli. 

After that we had the Movie Theater Dessert. It had Popcorn Creme Brulee? I'm not sure that was the name and homemade Milk Duds. The Creme Brulee was so good, very unique and highly recommended. There's a story for that too. 

We had a really good reasonably priced bottle of a bold red blend wine for $45. 

The decor is warm and inviting, woods, metal, with an ambient glow for the interior, a nice patio with inviting lighting and heaters for the outdoor patio. 

Side note: The bathroom was really great and I actually do see bathrooms as a reflection of the business. Every detail was considered, air freshener, modern decor, two types of specially scented soap,  and nice lotions. It was clean as a whistle and the mirror was crystal clear. Like noticeably clean and really clear! 

We live out of town but will definitely be coming back. One of the best restaurants in SB. I have eaten at many Nobo, Spago type restaurants, and this one compares. You better go before it gets too popular and you can't get it!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Excellent. Great food. Farmers market fresh. Pumpkin soup was beautiful. Best hamburger I think I have ever tasted. Creative menu. Delicious eucalyptus ice cream! Great service and ambiance.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Quiet romantic patio dining. Decent wine selection. The starters are just okay, but the BBQ themed entrees are special. I'll revisit. Prefer it a little over Lark."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Liked the vibe and that there are unique menu options, in particular, the scotch eggs, sunflower and bacon tart. Be prepared for small portions and it is not inexpensive."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"Disappointed. Dry chicken. Flavorless biscuit. Avocado gazpacho....absolutely awful.   Food is a bit weird. If you are up for a foodie adventure, you will enjoy. Limited options for entrees.  Agree with earlier review...look at prices before ordering wine. We almost ordered a 111.00 of sparkling Rose.  Did not care for ambience outside. Seating is incredibly uncomfortable."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"They ""forgot"" our order. We were here for many minutes being cool about the service since we are that kinda people. Delayed with no excuse."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Took the train up from Fullerton for a day in SB and the hotel suggested it as a place for great wine choices and great food, I couldn't agree more. Although I don't recall her name, Larka possibly, she was a level two som which made my dinner fantastic and made my experience worth a trip back.

I had the Tri-Tip paired with a great cab and the overall experience was great.

Thanks for a great dinner!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"They are doing Santa Maria Style BBQ on Thursday and Friday for lunch, not only is the food amazing but the bread! They buy it from Helena Avenue Bakery which is an awesome local business. The sides are as good as the mains!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I came here a couple of weekends ago with a girlfriend and fell in love---with both the service and the food. I wish I had gotten the name of the woman who helped us because she gave us great suggestions and was very pleasant and welcoming! We ended up splitting the hamburger and french fry thingies, the cheese plate, and the beignets---amazing! Will definitely return!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"What a marvelous find!! We were in SB for a mini-vaca and stumbled around looking for a nice meal.  This restaurant delivered that in spades.  Both my wife & I were delighted by the Uni & squid ink capellini and the ""market fish"" was similarly delicious and imaginative.  Presentation, taste, and textures were beautifully melded.

A definite ""must revisit"" in the future."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great environment. 
There are patio that you can have dinner with your dog as well. organic local ingredients is what they use. 
All food is really attached to the land. Amazing service  100% recomended"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Mussels were cooked just right! Great creative atmosphere and friendly staff. Looking forward to returning for dinner.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"On the atmosphere,  OK not. great.  The details inside feature well done rough cut woods. Pretty.  The big paned windows in the front abut a headlights in parking area.  Not so good.

On the service.  Great.

On the food, try the eucalyptus ice cream after meal and the Eggamuffin starter.  The acorn flour tagliatelle with mushroom is also flavored beautifully."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"A really disappointing experience! Everything was off with the exception for their house made bread, Avocado Gazpacho and Mussels all very good. Liked the ambience, appreciate their intentions of turning a deli into a very nice casual place to be and the emphasis on local ingredients and wines. However wines quite high,  $13.50 for a small pour of a wine that retails at $22 a bottle.

The ingredients listed on the menu were way off as to what actually appeared on your plate. The table shared the Chefs appetizer plate. Egga Muffin  really boring and bland, Santa Maria Tartare had no bean sprouts or tomato coulis, so small could barely find tartare. Gazpacho excellent.

Oak Tagliatelle that specified smoked favas didn't have a single fava, but loads of mushrooms some asparagus and uncooked brussel sprouts, none in description on menu. Served to our guest of honor that dislikes both mushrooms and asparagus. No mention by waitress of substitutions to any of the plates. The Hidden Valley Ravioli came without the duck egg, one large ravioli, that was only edible in the center, edges of pasta chewy and hard.

Beignets were raw gooey in center and burnt on outside, besides coming with a long hair attached. So much for our birthday celebration!

Service began well. Waitress pleasant but after food arrived didn't see her until dessert order. When we ordered dessert she told us she was leaving and left check, just before 9pm. At 9 most of the staff had a gathering in the bar area for a few minutes and then all left restaurant. It was distracting in the restaurant not a good atmosphere. The restaurant serves until 10pm on Fri, and a few guests still dining, cutting payroll?

Sorry to have had these bad experiences, we went with high expectations, but to have had so many glaring failures, sure can't see giving it another try."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"A decent romantic date spot with State St. prices and subpar service. We went here with a group and were very out of place. This is a small restaurant suited for groups no larger than 4. My food was good, but several others in our group complained of cold, inedible food. When they complained, the waiter offered to heat it back up, but did not offer a discount or apology. as"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"People have been talking about this place's burger and so I decided to give it a try with a my gf and a few friends. I was definitely NOT  impressed by any means, the service was ridiculously slow and they weren't even that busy! In fact, the table next to us complained that they hadn't gotten their food and had been sitting there for quite a while. We were ready for the check and the server hadn't come around to check on us in about 30 minutes! I will never go back to this place due to their lack of service and the food wasn't that great to top it off; I much rather go to a place where I know I will get great service and a great meal. SB has amazing restaurants and this definitely isn't one of them."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great ambience, great service, very good food!
From the moment we walked in the experience has been top notch! Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable, made great suggestions about food and wine! Grilled avocado starter is a must! Tri tip was very tasty as well!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"I'm not sure I entirely understand the hype of this restaurant. Although the food was good, there were not a lot of options for entrees and appetizers.

The portions are very small for the price you pay.

They only serve beer and wine (plenty of options)

I would not recommend sitting outside on the patio as you can see and hear the cars on the street (there have apparently been several accidents at that corner where the cars have actually driven INTO the protective gate of the building) It is a very tricky intersection so cars speed through and you see/hear the tires burning.

It's an organic kind of a restaurant so if that is not your style, I would say go somewhere else."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"One of my top favorite places to eat in Santa Barbara! Food, service, ambiance are all outstanding. Their dishes are so unique, fresh and very tasty. I recommend the chiefs plate to start. Oak Tagliatelle, & the Raviolo are my favorite. But everything is good here. You can't go wrong.

They recently added brunch on the weekends. Which is amazing!!! Huevos is my favorite. And there iced coffee is a must try."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Brunch on the weekends.... as good as food gets in this town. I've review them 3 times now at least but I have no association with them. It's just that each time is more amazing then the last.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Just had their burger, absolutely the best I've ever had!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I almost don't want to give this secret away, since I've been loving how easy it is to get in, but.. Saturdays and Sundays this is the BEST brunch in SB. I'm addicted to the B.L.E.A.T. tartine (grilled bread and grilled avocado = match made in heaven) and the amazing beignets with lemon curd and olallieberry jam. A little off the beaten path, but no brunch crowds and a lovely outdoor patio.

We've also been to dinner here a half dozen times now, and it never fails to disappoint. I love the fact that they're really going local, with dishes inspired by Santa Barbara (Oak acorns! Pinquito beans!) and a great wine list.

One note is that their portions are quite generous, so you might want to go in and split a few courses - it's a relatively small menu so you can sample just about everything on it with a couple friends. Totally worth it."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Barbareño is a must try if you're in Santa Barbara! Our favorite dishes included the eggamuffin (a gourmet spin on the McDonald's egg McMuffin, which originated in Santa Barbara) and the wagyu tri tip."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Wonderful tasting food, great service, excellent beer choices (and wine)- I left very, very satisfied."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,One of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara.  Charming and intimate atmosphere and staff are as professional and well trained as it gets.  The melon gazpacho has an incredible flavor profile and the Bao appetizer is innovative and flavorful.   The santa barbara tri tip is inviting from a block a way and doesn't disappoint.   And the local caught fresh cod was moist and delicious with an asian miso flair!   The pork belly is not to be missed and if you want the best beignets  desert this side of New Orleans this is it.   The wine list is also great and overall I must say this is a great value considering the food and ambience.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"Stumbled upon this place because they were open late and we were starving. Pics and reviews looked good. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. Very attentive and helpful. Very cute decor. And the food really tasted pretty good. Here is my issue. Enough with the sophisticated menu already. Gazpacho was amazing, but served with bee pollen and in shot glasses? A Cobb salad. Come on....three lettuce wedges with bacon balls and toasted something with egg fluff and roses? Does it come with a side of goldflecked bleu cheese crumbles? Pretentious as hell. Every single item rolling out of the kitchen is an awkward masterpiece, making me afraid to order a piece of chicken for fear it may come rolled in saffron and tied with fairy garland. Keep it simple is what this place needs to hear. One or two fancy smancy items are great, but everything? Would love to come back for just a piece of fish or a chicken quarter with some potatoes and white wine. Maybe someday"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Love this place.  You have got to be in a creative mood to eat here since the descriptions of some of the food, especially the desserts are very obscure.  Plus the flavor combinations border on not sounding good at all - like whole grain mustard carmel doughnut (turns out it doesn't taste like mustard).  
And while I understand it, having to put in your credit card number to make a reservation for 6 or more -- and if you don't come you get charged $20 PER HEAD - is very off-putting.  Even though I love their food, I nearly switched bringing 12 people to this restaurant because of this requirement.  So Barbareno is finicky and just know that even though you have to put up with this annoying stuff, the food is good here."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"Didn't like it!  The eggamuffin was a cold soggy unappealing mess.  The grilled avocado had way too much vinegar.  There was nothing special about the chicken.

The wine and service were good.  I would not go back.  Better food in my own kitchen,"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I was so pleasantly delighted by the food, service and ambiance here! The beignets for dessert are a must! We started with the brussel sprouts, which were so crispy and delicious, then I had the black cod, which was lovely, and my boyfriend had the burger, which we both consider the best burger in town. The wine selection was great, and service tremendous. My new favorite restaurant in SB!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Excellent meal and very knowledgable staff!  We started with the chefs plate snack, a trio of mushroom bisque, eggamuffin, and steak tartare which were all fantastic.  Then we had the oak tagliatelle, followed by the Santa Maria bbq.  They were all amazing and they were paired expertly by the wine director."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great vibe in this place! Good style and energy - like The Lark without being overly ""sceney"". Salmon special was one of the best salmon dishes I've had. Certainly top 5. Me and my hubby may make this a regular stop depending on how frequently they switch up the menu and introduce new items. 

Only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is because the tables are a bit close so you feel like you are in other peoples conversations. The patio and a few other areas offer more intimate/private experiences I think."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"My fiance and our friends were excited to try out this new restaurant, so we made reservations for the New Years Eve at 9:00 pm.  Sadly, our experience was only so-so.

Our table was about 10 minutes late to be ready, but that is to be expected on a holiday evening, so that wasn't really a problem.  We had a seat at the bar and all split a bottle of champagne.  The bartender was efficient and friendly. 

Once we were sat at our table we were quickly greeted by our server, and had pretty good service for the rest of the evening from her.  Unfortunately I did not get her name, but she was friendly, knew the menu well, and attentive. 

At this point in the evening I would have probably given 4 stars, however sadly the food was sub par.  

We started with the Chef's Plate appetizer, and it was OK, but nothing to die for.  Very small portions, and they flavors were a little bland.

My fiance and one of our friends ordered the Burger.  It tasted so gamy, it was like we were eating venison meat rather than beef.  I almost think the meat might have been starting to go bad, which is why the strong, not appetizing taste.

I ordered the Black Olive Raviolo.  It was okay, but nothing special. Nothing that I would recommend someone needed to try.

Lastly our friend ordered the Santa Maria BBQ Tri Tip, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  If I were to give this restaurant another try, this would be the dish I would try.

The restaurant is new, so maybe down the road we would give it another shot, but for now we are staying away."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"I wanted to like this place so bad! We ordered a lot of food (seven dishes), as we often do, to give a place an honest chance to impress us, a chance they threw away. Hard. 

When the pasta came, the vegetarian option on the menu, tasting it felt like we were living someone else's nightmare. The presentation of a dimly-violet pasta in a gray Brussels sprout soup was off-putting. Taste was bland and unpleasant with sporadic, harsh infusions of smoke flavor completely out of place, gave us a headache.

Ceviche, is not an easy dish to make well and the kitchen did not overcome the odds. This ceviche was ""overcooked"". When making this dish you have to time your acidity with meat density perfectly. It tasted like it came from the back of the fridge, instead of being just sprinkled with lime. Think crunch, a dish like this needs it, not just from the cracker.

This was good; get the mussels. The sauce, the toasted bread, are unforgettable. I will be back for these. The chocolate dessert was unremarkable but overall good.

Pork belly. If there is pork belly on the menu it's getting ordered. Period. I grew up on the stuff. I've eaten it out of Chinese clay pots, woks, even glass jars in the Ukraine. I prefer it friend, which this should have been to earn its ""crispy"" description on the menu. This was a dish so underwhelming that I felt truly sorry for the animal that donated it. A waste. Served on a bed of cabbage-hoping-to-be-slaw, this felt like an afterthought in an establishment with a blazing grill billowing in the parking lot. SMH.

There is a churro-like dessert on the menu too. I wish it was just a churro, instead of doughnut chunks with white sugar-ooze dripping out of them that tasted... ordinary. A breakfast dish more so than desert; promise of goat cheese was a distant memory in this sugary dystopia. 

I want to encourage the staff to be more bold with their opinions instead of leaving room for these huge ordering mistakes by the patrons. 

The servers messed up quite a few times bringing the wrong dishes to the wrong tables in our seating area. It feels like the potential of something beautiful is going to waste. Ordering a ton of items to find one or two good ones feels like digging through a stack of needles for a straw of hay. 

We need to regroup Barbareno, get some fresh blood, the rest will fall in place. I wish you luck."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Barbareño came to my attention through a Google search and Eater.com article on 10 essential Santa Barbara restaurants.  http://bit.ly/2x4IFw1

The menu is inspired.  The atmosphere is casual for the price of the menu items, but I'm a food first type guy and this is central coast California after all, so hey.

We ordered the famed sous vide tri-tip.  It was an experience. If you do not know that tri-trip originated in central coast California then you may not understand the significance of bringing this regional special forward with a modern technique.  You'd appreciate the great taste of the dish even without this context, but you can appreciate it a little bit more with asking your server about the process of sous vide and then smoking used to prepare this dish.

We also ordered a new Fried Chicken dish that had been on the menu one week.  It was good, but not as stand out as the tri-tip.  The brussels sprouts were also recommended as a popular dish by our server and were a stand out dish on their own."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Amazing place. Definitely a hidden treasure here in SB. Very much worth  the 2 block excursion off of State st. Every person here pays so much attention to the details of the food and the experience, incredibly refreshing. These folks really care and it shows. Absolutely can't wait to go back. The menu is not extensive but when you experience Flavors packed into each item you won't care. Wine list is decent as well with lots of area wines represented and a couple local brew always on tap. Great SB experience :-)"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,The service was good. The food was more expensive than it was worth. My tri-tip had been reheated. It had that faint taste of fat that we've all tasted when we've reheated it.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Wonderful Sunday night diner, what a great first experience.  Service was certainly one of the best we had in Santa Barbara for years, Lenka is extremely knowledgeable about wines worldwide and the sweetest person ever.

Snacks included:
- chef's plate with mini tartare, mushroom bisk and eggamuffins, all very good (to be very precise, we found the blinis of the eggamuffins too much pastry for the topping, but this is really to be able to say something else than just ""wonderful"")
- Santa Maria Tartare, very tasty, excellent meat, fresh bean sprouts, just the right amount of tomato coulis

Starter:
-we shared a California roll, good and fresh, we would prefer the yellowtail to be raw.  Tasty.

Mains:
- Lampchops, tender, juicy and very tasty
- Black Olive Raviolo, well seasoned, good fennel taste, creamy chevre, large duck egg, delicious.

Deserts:
- Chocolate Muffet Tuffet, very good, real dark chocolate, good size, some fresh fruits
- Beignets, pistachio sauce, delicious.

Syrah - Qupe, Thanks to Lenka an excellent choice.

We will definitely be back.

Lenka, enjoy your well deserved trop to Slovakia and enjoy Beaune, bring us back some wonderful wines."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"We had a wonderful dinner on October 31st.  We started with the eggamuffins (amazing) and the halibut sushi roll - which has no rice, but this delicious rice foam you swipe your bite through.  

I will echo what has already been said by other reviewers - THE BREAD!!  THE BREAD!!  This is the best bread we have had in years - paired with the home made butter.... Ahh - if all they sold was bread, we would buy it EVERY DAY.

My husband had the pork belly plate with the tenderloin.  I had the Santa Maria Tri Tiip with pinquinto beans.  The process for cooking this meat must be incredible - because it combines a perfectly smokey flavor with a tender, tender bite of meat.  And those pinquinto beans - Yum.

For dessert we shared the Basil Ice Cream and the Bacon and Date tart.   Both were terrific.  We're looking forward to coming back and trying all the other menu items that look amazing.

We will now definitely add Barbareno to our regular dining out options."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Chefs plate had a little bit of everything! You HAVE to try it! Little bit size morsels of bliss gives you a taste of what is to come!

Mussels appetizer - perfect portion for two, tomato sauce with fennel ammmazing. 

Pork plate- fennel, coleslaw, savory crunchy oatmeal, and fried crunchy pork ears. 

Santa Maria tri tip- with beans. 

Everything was amazing! The decor is amazing, this is what people want delicious food, amazing atmosphere, great staff the decor is industrial cool."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Best tritip I have ever had, hands down! The only thing preventing the a 5 star review was the price. This was a very expensive meal and the food was just barely worth the price. The appetizers were very good. The avocado roll was amazing, with fish wrapped in avocado. The sunflower root appetizer was also excellent. Though in both of these cases the price just barely matched the value of the food. The tritip whoever easily exceeded the value, this was the best triptip dish I have ever had. If you like tritip you must try this meal. FInally came desert and while it was good it was not worth the price. 

One other point of interest is that they really try to have a story as to why each dish is chosen. For instance the avocado roll was inspired because the restaurant sits on the site of the first avocado tree planted in Santa Barbara. This is a very nice touch that gives the meal a bit more interest than otherwise.

In summary I will go back but not as often as I might if the prices came down a bit."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Birthday dinner at Barbareno with the added treat of a new dish: Fried Green tomatoes like we've never seen, perfectly cooked with delicious accoutrements, even the micro arugula which could have been just decorative was flavorful. Shared as a first with friends followed by as always excellent entrees."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"If I could give it 6 Stars I would! This has to be one of the best meals I've ever had. The servers, the ambiance and the food were exceptional. Started with the amazing hamachi dish (off the menu) and grilled avocado with avocado mousse. Had to request for extra homemade sourdough bread to scrape the sauces clean!!! Then continued to the carbonara mussels with squid ink pasta and eggplant garam masala with cauliflower.  Sooooooo amazing! Then the lamb gyros that's been marinated and slow cooked for how many hours was so tender with crispy edges in homemade pita bread. Divine! The finale was the semifredo that i can't stop thinking about: it is the best rocky road dessert I've ever had: coffee flavored with homemade caramel sauce, melty marshmallows, crunchy walnuts and cocoa nibs. I can't wait to go back to Santa Barbara and Barbareño!!!! P.S. they serve this kombucha drink on tap that was delicious (and I'm not even a kombucha drinker)!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Loved this place and our waiter David was so knowledgeable and accommodating. Decided to focus on ""snacks"" and appetizers. Snack was chef's platter, which had most delicious pumpkin soup, their play on Egg McMuffins and carpaccio. Our mains were their appetizers. Foie gras for me with pickled grapes and cashew butter. Delicious Hope Ranch mussels in a fennel broth for my husband!  No room for main courses, but had to sample the amazing ginger cake with candied lemon and coconut whipped cream!  Plus, David brought us a taste of their homemade Milk Duds!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"We've been wanting to try Barbareño for years given its reputation. We heard from people that it's amazing, just ok, and not worth it. 

I think the OKAY is where I fall. The dishes highlight solid combinations of simple ingredients. The menu provides a ton of opportunity to be adventurous with this combos. And the entrees really execute for the chef. The BBQ or anything they smoke is their specialty: the tri tip was to die for.

I was a little surprised by the service. Our waiter was lovely, but we had to pour our own bottle of wine we purchased from the restaurant. It took a while to get served in the first place. And restaurant is a lot more rustic/trendy/hipster than nice/date night service. Not inherently bad, just not what I expected.

Would recommend to those interested in an adventurous, locally-sourced meal!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This gem is for diners who want to be delighted by the unusual! Cobb salad soup, beignets with marzipan, their own splendid version of California rolls and a clever spin of an Egg Mcmuffin (admit it, foodies, we all had one once) are among savory and innovative menu selections- we had a difficult time choosing! The decor is simple, yet cozy. Service is excellent, noise level acceptable. There is outdoor seating and a bar in main dining room that also serves food. Well worth the price!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great find in Santa Barbara, came from reading amazing reviews and was not disappointed! Loved the clean, simple, modern beach feel of the restaurant, the food was simply delicious, beautiful presentation. But nothing beats the service, we had a reservation for 12:30pm, they close at 1:30pm to get ready for dinner, we hit horrible traffic so called to change it to 1pm, they told us that they close kitchen around that time but that they would keep it open for us(random strangers!), then we hit even more traffic and now we are arriving at 1:30pm so I called to pretty much to cancel because we wouldn't make it on time and Jesse(who answered the phone each time) told us he was going to ask the kitchen, then he told us not to worry, to get there that they would wait for us, to look at the menu online and order the food if we could and he would have it ready for us! I have never experience such VIP treatment without being a VIP at all, from a restaurant I have never been before! Really amazing experience before even getting there, only to be paired with an amazing food!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Magnificent, marvelous and mouth watering. Two years ago I stumbled upon this wonderful place just looking for a special outdoor dining spot on a weekend visit to SB. The reviews seemed promising and because we were so blown away we have now been back 10 times from LA. The food is the undeniable star here, from an ingenious take on egg McMuffins to the ash smoked eggplant which I devoured, (eggplant is my LEAST favorite thing) this kitchen is impeccable. The deliciously pillowy black cod in a delicate green curry laced with carrot ribbons was so good I didn't even share a bite. The pork shank with the 38 spiced mole was fall off the bone elegant and divine. We adore the avocado gazpacho with bee pollen rim, the oak tagliatelle, and the desserts are unbelievable. Basil ice cream? Homemade Beignets? Semifredo with stiff soft marshmallows and caramel de leche? Course after course this place is just simply spectacular. Upon our second visit we actually went two nights in a row to taste everything. For a while we never wanted to write a review because we wanted to keep Barbareño a secret, but everyone must go. Please make a reservation and make me wait weeks to get in, because I want everyone to enjoy this place as much as we do."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This is a perfect place for a date night. I recommend sitting outside, but inside was nice too. Not too loud. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable. I tend to ask a lot of questions about the food and they could answer all of them and more. We started with the chefs sampler, then the mussels, and then my husband had the burger and I had the Santa Maria BBQ. Everything was sooo good and they make everything in house. We also got an avocado purée. Yum yum."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"First time here and service was great, wine selection is really good BUT the pricing to quantity of food you get is ridiculous. Unfortunately I was not impressed with the amount of food I got for the price. Very small portions. $26 for two small pieces of tri-tip?  Forget it. I had to go eat food at home after my $100 dinner bill."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Absolutely delicious!! The vibe is hip, but relaxing enough. We ordered the Melville Pinot noir to drink - one of my faves. Highly recommend. We had the mussels to start - broth was amazing! I had the Salmon, was cooked to perfection. I like it on the more rare side - still coral pink - just the way I like it. It had a drizzle of a very light lemon infused sauce and was served on a bed of roasted baby potatoes of multiple colors. My boyfriend had the Santa Maria style tri tip that was absolutely phenomenal! You could taste the smoke in the meat, so good. The smoker is right out in front of the restaurant in the parking lot. For dessert, we had the popcorn infused creme brûlée that was served with homemade milk duds. Let me tell you, it was ahhhhmazing! Just a heads up, portions are small, but the food is absolutely worth it!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Had the best dinner at the bar. The grilled avocado and tri tip were delicious. The bread is homemade. The service and atmosphere are on point Thanks to Lenka for recommendations and thoughtful wine selections. We'll definitely be back - this was a treat!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I've been here twice now with both my family and my girlfriend's family, and both times everyone was a raving fan. I may not have the most discriminating tastes but my parents are definitely more of a tough customer, and they loved it and would definitely come back.

Thursdays is beer and burger night (free beer with a burger), I highly recommend coming out for it!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,The last time I had food this good and service on this level was at Chez Panisse. This is the best restaurant I've been to in Santa Barbara. Our dining experience was equal to being at a a great opera. And so bravo!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Loved it! Such a cute place with a great vibe! We sat outside on the patio for my bday dinner and I adored it! Our waitress was awesome -- super friendly and lead us through the menu well. The tri-tip was perfect -- buttery and delicious. Love the attention to details and little special parts of each menu item. The eggamuffins were fun and just what I hoped they be! The charcuterie board had good variety and was just right. Definitely a great choice, can't wait to go back again!!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"My boyfriend and I thought we would try them for brunch. We were seated right away and the host even attempted to move umbrellas to give us some shade. Unfortunately I can't comment on the food because we left after being ignored by wait staff. Within the span of about 10 minutes, 3 or 4 waiters walked past our table without acknowledging us. I hope that Barbareño staff will improve their service in the future. We will be spending our money at one of Santa Barbara's many other restaurants."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great salad with black garlic, wine, plumb wine, trip tip, mussels.... all of it. 5 star service and food."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Delicious, quaint, informative, creative and an all around pleasant experience. The Oak tagliatelle was amazing, as well as the chefs plate starter. Doug was a fantastic server, well prepared and knowledgeable."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"We had a reservation at 7:45 and got there early, around 7:00. We went to the bar as they said our table was on dessert. Needless to say the place was practically empty. They refused to seat us until exactly 7:45. That was the first issue, I mean if you're understaffed or don't seat until the very minute of a reservation, just say so. Appetizers were okay. Two of us ordered the tri tip as that's what they're known for. It was horrible. Over cooked and chewy. The sides/garnishments were ice cold. We sent it back and decided to share a burger which was okay. They sent out a dessert as a nice gesture but it was foul. It was their signature dessert and had pot in it. It tasted like I was eating smoked pot, so gross. Know your audience, not everyone enjoys marijuana and they said there was no THC in it.  How is that possible? Skip it, there's much better choices in SB."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Had the brioche burger it was mouth watering .. Someone had recommended it and so glad I tried it.. One of those meals I will order every time just because I don't think anything else could beat it. Service was very attentive. Lighting was dim and intimate. Bread was awesome but they only give you one piece so order an appetizer if you're starving. Beautiful in door seating .
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"We ordered a salad to share, pork BBQ, and market fish. The salad came timely and it was delicious. But we waited quite a while for our entrees. Half an hour after we had our salad, the entrees arrive. The pork was steaming hot but the fish was cold. It had been clearly sitting while the pork was cooking. Such as shame.

Staff wasn't fine, but a bit infrequent with the check ins. The waiter didn't come by so I could address the cold entree. Overall, I was disappointed."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Excellent service, employees are all very attentive and knowledgeable.. Wasn't that impressed with the food however. The chocolate truffles that accompany the creme brûlée were terrible. The brûlée itself was standard.. The tri tip was ok, cooked nicely, but lacked flavor and or any creative components.. The avocado gazpacho was super acidic, and the tartare was underwhelming.. The eggamuffin was creative, but seemed to be lacking something.. I would order the mussels again and the wine list was very nice.. The patio dining was quite nice and the ambiance of the entire establishment was very appealing. Will return to give the food another shot."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"We were so happy to see this restaurant open up. The restaurant seems to pride themselves on creativity, innovation, knowledge, science, and current trends. But most of all, they love Santa Barbara and the central coast just like so many others. We were so happy to see unique food pairings with strong ingredients, yet in medley with the other main elements and wine. The chefs plate, uni, beef, bacon date tart were amazing. I'm already checking the website for the December menu! I highly recommend stopping by, but make a reservation. They are popular already!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"I've eaten at Barbareno twice; once for dinner and once for brunch and they were both outstanding.   For dinner we had the coffee fried quail, yep that's right.   It was awesome.   They were out of ice cream so we ordered the beignets for dessert and they were amazing.    For brunch we had the beignets again, awesome!    And definitely try the SB Smorgasbord.  One of the best brushes I've ever had.   Check this place out!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great place, small and intimate, but bustling with activity. We had the Santa Maria tri-tip and the lamb ribs: both were outstanding. Desserts are out of this world, especially the chocolate lava cake thingy. Lanka (apologies for the spelling!) was our server, she was fantastic. Five stars!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Love this place.  The staff was amazing.  If say their steak my friends got was better than my fish fish but we had tons of the appetizers and loved them all!
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"We went to Barbareno to check it out, now that they have a new chef.  It used to be superb, so wanted to find out if it had changed.  They still have BBQ - but only one style now.  My partner had that and said it was as good as always.

I had the Fried Chicken and it was delightful, as well.  Perfectly cooked.  It was very rich though, so I took half home.  Which is good news, because i have a wonderful lunch waiting for me!

We had the Hope Ranch Mussels to share for a starter, and again, they were marvellous!  Cooked just right and the sauce with fennel was amazing!!

That's the good news.  Chef good, but menu selections limited.  But that's probably because they are just getting new menus together.

Now, for the BAD news, and it is bad indeed!  We ordered a nice red wine at a fairly reasonable price point.  You need to know that Barbareno has VERY high prices on their wines!  Anyway, picked a Syrah.  After 10 minutes the waitress came back to tell us that they didn't have any of this wine.  She recommended a different Syrah, which we agreed to, despite it being $22 more in price.  Then, some 15 minutes later (notice that we still have no drinks after 25 minutes!), another waitress comes out and says they don't have the second wine, either!!!  I was a bit perturbed by this time!  So again, I asked for another recommendation and asked if we could have it soon, please!

This waitress became quite huffy and said - 'of course, madame'!!! very condescendingly!  Then, she recommended a wine that was ANOTHER $15 higher than the second wine!  So we are now some $37 higher in price than the original bottle we ordered!  In most restaurants, this would be the price of the wine!!

By this time, we were parched, and we wanted to order, so I agreed to the wine, despite the price.  I did ask the waitress if we could have it for the same price as the second wine and she just gave me a dirty look and stormed off in a huff!!!!  Not the way you treat customers, for sure!

And, to top it off, when the wine came, it was just mediocre!  

As I said, the food was great.  but the service was slow and the wine list should be updated asap so they don't disappoint customers.  And they need to get rid of that waitress!  Have had her before and she is always awful!!!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Best dinner I've had since we moved to Santa Barbara. The food was amazing, the service impeccable, loved the decor. Oh my goodness everything tasted so divine!!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Celebrated my birthday here - great choice! 5 Star service and ambiance. Difficult menu choices - everything sounded great. Started with chef's plate for appies, my friend had the pigeon and I had the salmon. Basil ice cream for dessert! yes, basil ice cream. heavenly. 5 Star cuisine!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"We had high hopes for this place. It was very pretty outside and the heaters were a great addition.
Both my husband and I were really underwhelmed by the food. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great. It was pricy, which is ok, when you feel like it's a great experience,  but kind of ""meh"" to us both.
It was my husband's birthday and the complimentary gelato was appreciated and a nice touch.
For us, we'd come back for a glass of wine and the goat cheese on the patio. The entrees aren't up to par for the other options in town."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Wow wow wow wow wow! What an incredibly fun and delectable experience! You cannot go wrong here! Casual or dressed up, looking for a light fare or a hearty meal: this is the place. It is tastefully put together and trendy, decor and food. We loved every minute. Our favorites were the play on the egg mcmuffin app, the ravioli and the inside out ice cream. Every single item we tasted was full of flavor and thoughtfully made. The staff is gracious and knowledgable. It's a win!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This place is awesome. Creative and delicious food, the portion sizes are perfect and the service is great. They have an nice outdoor patio with heaters and they allow dogs."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Unique and carefully prepared using fresh local ingredients. Great selection of wines with beer on tap. Perfectly portion, plated and delicious."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Definitely recommend getting the chef's plate. Scottish eggs were...ok they are deep fried quail eggs, what could go wrong...delicious! Really good craft beer selection as well; Brewery Bois? Yes please! And a nice selection of stouts. Unfortunately out of the Eucalyptus ice cream or would have had desert."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Read that they are open for brunch on weekends so we headed over today. Just as wonderful as dinner, service was epic, food and drink as good as it gets. The patio is perfect for a sunny day. Can't wait to go back."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"wow what a great meal we had hereon their very comfy patio.  make sure you check out the menu just to get an idea of their creativity.  started with the homemade bread, oh so yummy.  the appy sampler would have been perfect for 4 but the 2 of us devoured it easily, I was especially impressed with the attention to detail I mean seriously, lemongrass and bee pollen on the rim of the cup that the gazpacho is served in?  and cured egg?  yolks cured in salt till they become sliceable?  who does that for under $50 an entrée?   cobb salad was also fantastic.  mains for us were the grilled chicken and plate of pork.  the chicken was one of the best I've had.  the house cured ham on the pork dish was a tiny bit dry so they made some ham and cheese beignets for us to enjoy.  no room for desert.  wish they were in the bay area as I'd go once a week.  really one of the best meals I've ever had."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"May move to Santa Barbara so I can be a regular here. We got: Eggamuffins, Hamachi crudo, grilled avocado, oak tagliatelle, santa maria BBQ, cheeseburger, strawberry shortcake.

We were *truly obsessed* with *every dish*.  I can't stop thinking  about this meal, particularly the Eggamuffins. GET THE EGGAMUFFINS. I just wanna shout it from the rooftops. My friend stated the cheeseburger was the best she's ever had in her life. And the potatoes it came with...omg. Dessert was insane. Servers were amazing--friendly and knowledgable. Ambience/decor was super cool. Everything was perfect, the end."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"What a wonderful surprise. I expected a good dinner, but not an extraordinary one. Barbareño's creativity and elegant integration of flavors just boggled our minds. From the first taste of the wonderful Chef's Plate to the last bite of the Beet Brownie, every morsel of every dish was delicious and inventive. 

Chef Julian Martinez knows his ingredients and uses them to bring depth and contrast to his amazing creations. The Avocado Roulade is an inside out re-thinking of a California roll whose nori-lime vinaigrette lifts the dish into an arena of bright flavors that most sushi rollers only dream of. The Tomatoes embody at least 4 or 5 different ideas of what a farm-fresh, locally grown tomato can become, including a ""tomato yolk"" whose creaminess complements the pickled tomatoes hiding in the main, crispy dish. 

The Pork Plate's two meats - pork loin and pork belly, in this case - combine to produce the perfect combination of smoky, fatty crunch and lean cleanness. 

They have Giornata Barbera from Paso Robles by the glass. Its cherry-red fruit pops through on the finish and leaves you lusting for another sip. 

We wanted to save room for dessert, and would have been fine had we not each ordered one. The fantastic basil ice cream would have been enough. But we also got the scrumptious Beet Brownie - deep chocolate with the earthiness of beets sounds weird but tastes amazing. 

Kudos to Ryan Springmeier who we were lucky enough to snag as our waiter. He's the Floor Manager, and knows how to exceed every expectation and delight his customers. 

I can't recommend Barbareño highly enough. Go soon. When the word gets out, you might not be able to get a table!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Great restaurant. The sourdough bread was delicious. We ordered the sunflower appetizer, which was amazing. The moon fish was good as well. We order the bacon dessert. I loved the candied bacon, but was a little underwhelmed by the rest of the dessert. I love how it is off the main street and is tucked away on a residential street. Will definitely be back."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Tried Barbareno last night for the first time, for Mother's Day. The space inside is very clean, the patio outside looks comfortable and more casual (not that inside is formal at all). Cleanest bathroom I've ever been in, in a SB restaurant! Ryan, our server, was fantastic. Helpful, fun, good sense of humor, without being overbearing. Three of us for dinner had the chef's plate app (a few bites of each of the 3 apps on the menu), (1x) coffee-rubbed fried quail, and (2x) the ""pork plate"" which had spareribs and ear! All were very tasty. Excellent local wine and beer selection with many options. Looking forward to going back to try their tritip and fish dishes. They also offered what sounded like a vegetarian pasta dish in case that's your thing. Only negative mark - their wine/beer paper menu was soiled. Owners: If you're going to charge $13 and up for a glass of wine, your establishment is not junky - but a dirty menu sure feels junky... The rest of the place (food/service/decor) didn't match the dirty menu. Just toss them if they get soiled and print new ones!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Barbareno is the new PLACE in Santa Barbara's competitive food scene! It is simply excellent on all fronts, and chef Julian's suggestion to try the bar on a recent night when it was sold out was perfect. The wait staff, chefs, managers were all so well engaged with all the patrons - it's no wonder this place will sell out most nights it opens.  The sampler appetizer plate was phenomenal - the interpretation of chorizo flavors without that product, rolled into hand made corn chip crust - amazing - as was the bouquet of flavors in the roasted beet tart. My son had the artisinal California roll, rolled in Avocado, Barbareno style.  Our main courses - the Tri-Tip and monkfish - were expertly prepared and perfectly complemented on the plate. Explanation of each course was thoughtfully explained and relayed the mission of Barbareno - we will be back soon!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"Fabulous little spot, hidden away off the beaten path.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  Everything about this restaurant is simple on the outside...but what arrives on the table is complex, creative and unexpected.  Everything has an element of being deconstructed, reconstituted, or somehow reinvented.  Start with a Chef's Plate: a sampling of ALL of the ""snacks"" offered on the menu (like an expanded plate of little amuse bouche bites).  All three are amazing; particularly eggamuffins and scotch eggs.  We were a party of 3 and shared plates.  The California Roll was super interesting; not a sushi-style rice roll.  More of a rolled, layered paté.  The Oak Tagiatelle was delicious; handmade acorn pasta--so special.  The entire dish radiated with flavor.    We had the Santa Maria BBQ, the Plate of Pork and the Market Fish.  Each one, exquisite.  The ""Movie Snack"" dessert was another delicious surprise--essentially a creme brulee with popcorn essence accompanied by handmade ""milk dud"" chocolate caramels, and the Muffett's Tuffets a must-not-miss for chocolate lovers. Portions are on the small side, but rich with flavor and complexity.  We definitely left feeling full and satisfied.  Service is attentive and professional, but warm and friendly.  The front of house is clearly very well managed and super organized.  Great meal, great experience!!"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,"This place looks very pretty and has a cool vibe, but the food was disappointing. They had only 1 raw vegan option.  They were going for a ""local with a twist"" idea, but it was too much!   The flavor combinatios were just too strange and did not work for my family.   We ordered the charcuterie appetizer and it was very small and had funky meats, no toast or fruits.  Our server was nice but did a poor job of explaining the menu and as a result our daughter could not eat her food because the fish was swimming in a spicy curry sauce.  That was $32 down the drain.   I love trying new and different foods, bit that place took ""foodie"" concept  too far.   Not a good place for family or vegan food."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This is a relatively new place on the Santa Barbara scene and it is a great addition. Started with the imaginatively prepared with the smoked beef tart mandarin, pistachio, coffee cured duck ( great flavors) Moved to the Acorn tagliatelle with wild mushroom, sage, carrizo . Then a perfectly done burger with pickled avocado, bacon, olive oil brioche. Finally capped it with a divine eucalyptus icecream with lavender. This is a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service. Trendy and fun and a must for foodies."
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,AMAZING !!! So beyond impressed with this place. Food was amazing and our server was outstanding ! We are visiting for the weekend and this place was across the street from our place. We had a reservation for 830 and didn't get seated until 9:00 but they bought a appetizer for the table that was so worth it. The actual entrees were even better I had the tri tip and it was amazing. But really these 5 stars go to our server she was so knowledgable and sweet made a world of difference. We will definitely be back !
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,"This place is so yum yum. Came here a year ago to celebrate our anniversary and came back again to celebrate it a year later and it was sweet. The entire staff was so attentive and well informed about items on the menu, including the host. It was raining but we sat outside by the heaters and ''twas perfect - quiet and romantic. Had items from their restaurant week menu - chicken was so flavorful! Thanks again, will be back to celebrate our anniversary next year :)"
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,negative,Delectable and creative farm fresh cuisine! One of our favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara and Ventura County. Quaint atmosphere. Wonderful and attentive staff. The chef is brilliant with unique twists on traditional dishes as well as innovative dishes of his own.
6HTGlttrzCMsuGBHO1ZGiw,Barbareño,American,positive,Yum.  Bao is awesome!  Lamb al Pastor was delicious.  My mouth is full of pure tasty goodness right now.  Can't talk.  So good!!!!
mZ-pJSdAVrBa7ioXVzE7-Q,Marbella,American,positive,"Braised Beef Short Rib Hash for breakfast. You can't go wrong. I ate it for four or five days straight and only wish I was staying at the Hyatt longer. Simply fabulous!! Atmosphere here is nice, the staff were very friendly. Hope to visit again soon!"
mZ-pJSdAVrBa7ioXVzE7-Q,Marbella,American,positive,"We are staying at the Inn at East Beach across the street from the The Hyatt where this restaurant is located. We had been evacuated and were sharing our room, taking care of a handicap patient who has some specific eating restrictions. There was a perfect path for her wheelchair to access the restaurant. Our server was the bartender at the Mar Vista Lounge/Bar earlier for lunch today (12/7/17) and he went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. Besides the food being delicious, the service was exceptional. I highly recommend visiting this restaurant if you're staying at one of the many hotels in this area. After eating a lot of junk during the fire evacuation it was lovely to have a real meal. The salmon is very good with the peas and rice/risotto, the salmon was very fresh! The Brussel Sprouts with the Soy Mustard Seed glaze was also very tasty! Our server and food handler manager really accommodated us during this stressful time providing our patient with a fresh no salt added salad. They go above and beyond here, even providing us with masks to avoid the smoke!
ps. Don't forget to order a Margarita!"
mZ-pJSdAVrBa7ioXVzE7-Q,Marbella,American,positive,"Fantastic hotel breakfast. Get the crab & lobster Benedict. My husband said his eggs were perfectly poached. That's a tough compliment to get out of him! 

The architecture is beautiful & there is a view of the beach right out the window. Clean restaurant with nicely set tables. The staff is great, they come with drink refills often. 

The buffet is great too, pretty standard but done well. Plenty of bread, muffin & pastry options. Eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, pancakes, granola with plenty of fresh fruit & yogurt. 

Its a good place to go for breakfast before heading over to the beach for the day! They were very nice about our messy baby too which is always a bonus for us."
mZ-pJSdAVrBa7ioXVzE7-Q,Marbella,American,negative,"Kids menu chicken strips taste like gas station kibble. Filet mignon is overcooked and the chinichurri is sour instead of tangy. Grilled chicken on the caesar salad was so burnt it was bitter. This was an odd dining experience. I would expect this from Dennys but come to think of it I have never had food this bad at Dennys. Avoid, there are so many great places in the area."
mZ-pJSdAVrBa7ioXVzE7-Q,Marbella,American,negative,"We ate here for dinner and it was pretty underwhelming. The food was just OK, I had the salmon with asparagus and quinoa. The service was pretty average as well, except for the fact that we had to wait about 45-60 minutes for our food!  

My father-in-law had the sea bass and said it was just average as well. 

When we arrived at 5:30 pm, there was no one else in the restaurant which should have been our first clue.

The ambience is very nice, as you can see East Beach out the windows across the street, but it's just unfortunate that the food and service wasn't up to par.

Overall I thought it was pretty expensive for the quality and service received."
mZ-pJSdAVrBa7ioXVzE7-Q,Marbella,American,negative,"The restaurant is closed Sunday -Thursday and they serve dinner by the pool, offering a very limited menu.  We were disappointed because the things we had seen on the menu on the Hotel website were not offered."
mZ-pJSdAVrBa7ioXVzE7-Q,Marbella,American,positive,"Enjoyed breakfast, ambience and service. Loved homemade salsa. Omelet was  good (though if I had it again I would ask to
Utilize less oil / butter). I. enjoyed the vege omelet and the  fresh squeezed orange juice."
mZ-pJSdAVrBa7ioXVzE7-Q,Marbella,American,negative,"Typical hotel breakfast, with an average buffet option. Nothing special or memorable. service is adequate. Pretty view of the beach. Clean."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Being a Santa Barbara City College student The Neighborhood is naturally a great place to go and hang out after a long day in classes!

This past semester after my last final, my friends and I decided to have a party at The Neighborhood. Location-wise, The Neighborhood is a quick 5-minute walk from Santa Barbara City College and the nearby apartments and the atmosphere there is really cool. It really is a ""neighborhood"" bar!

When we got there it was busy but there was still plenty of room. We ordered some pitchers, a couple of pizzas and come appetizers. It took a while to get the food but it was hot and really good.

There are plenty of activities including outdoor beer pong, foosball, ping pong, pool and arcade games. We all had a great time playing games and talking. The people who needed to smoke (not me) could go outside and the bar had everything we were looking for.

After a couple of hours we decided to move the party down to State Street but The Neighborhood served as a great starting point for a great night! I'm sure I'll be back to The Neighborhood many times this next semester!"

pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Great drinks and cool bartender. Ordered easy drinks and bartender was cool as she played scrabble with other patrons. Met some interesting folks but didn't eat. It wasn't busy while I was there and not sure how the service would be with some urgency. I'd go back and hang as its a mellow vibe but it's still SB with tons of young college kids.

walking distance to all hotels on Bath st.

my favorite part is the back patio with games available, corn hole and beer pong!"

pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I've driven to this bar and grill from Encino twice in the past year just for the atmosphere, games and food.  Love it here, the tri-tip steak nachos are bomb and even non-drinkers (like me) can still play a game of beer pong with water. Friendly other patrons both times I've been there and the staff is awesome too."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Always make a point to stop by the Neighborhood when in the area, great service and drink specials. Good food and always good times, don't forget to check out the Ping  pong tables and chalk walls fun atmosphere!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Love this place! You can do so much (beer pong, pool, ping pong, fusbol, or cornhole) and it's a fun little atmosphere. My friends and I always go here to play beer pong and the food is pretty good, especially their wings!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Great beers on tap!  I love the juke box!  The staff are great and keep everything under control!  I saw them handle a super drunk guy with respect and professionalism.  I even left my wallet at the place and was contacted by them via facebook.  Not one credit card or dollar was stolen and it was there over a week.  I love this place!!
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"Alright, so, it was my cousins wedding last night and the venue where the reception was held closed down at 10pm. My family and I decide to wander down the street and find a bar to hang out in. We walk up to the Neighborhood and they won't allow half our group in because they're from Canada and they don't recognize their IDs. They tell us they have to call the cops to come down and look at them. So we are all standing outside waiting, including the bride, for forever. I'm like,' Dude, come on, it's her wedding day and you're ruining it right now by not excepting perfectly fine IDs."" I mean, it's Santa Barbara, they must get tourists from other countries all the time, right? The bouncer is just being a huge jerk while we all just stand there waiting. Finally the cops show up and talk to the bouncers for a while, look at the IDs, the cops say they're legit, but for whatever reason the bouncers now refuse to let us in. I still don't understand why they couldn't allow people with Canadian IDs in or why they had to be such dicks about it, but I definitely wouldn't recommend going there."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"ehh... this place is dece. It's an overpriced bar that doesn't know if it wants to be a dive or a sports bar. Who charges $15 for a pitcher of Coors Right? Your bar isn't THAT tight. Get over yourself.

Also, I love beer pong. Don't get me wrong. It's the only thing I'm good at in life, buuuut when your urinals are overflowing into the hallway and the beer pong balls are landing in it AND people are still playing with those balls.... ehhh"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I appreciated the cheap pitchers and lively atmosphere. I got to play at least 4 different games (ping pong, cornhole, pool, foosball) and really enjoyed that. It was fun!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Nice bar to chill at. Cool people working there. Pool table and arcade games. Plus, pingpong table. Did was pretty good as well."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"My favorite bar in Santa Barbara.  There is a lot to do as they have pool, ping pong, beer pong, foosball, an electonic jukebox, videogames, and tons of TVs.  The drinks are really cheap, and you can a make a meal out of their appetizers, which are dirt cheap during happy hours.  The drinks are pretty strong, and it's a great place to watch a sporting event."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Its a really cool place...while traveling through it was dissapointing to learn that it was no longer a gay bar..however... great beers on tap, Fun setup, beer pong tables , ping pong tables, big screen, u can write on walls with chalk, and despite not being gay.. many hot boys and girls to appease your craving for eye candy... i reccomend coming with friends for a good time.. gay or not."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Basic divey sports bar. Super cheap drinks, but reeeaallly good bar food! I got the tri tip quesadilla and it was cooked to perfection with lots of tri tip and cheese. It also came with salsa and sour cream. I've also had the french fries which were pretty salty and reminded me of McDonald's french fries. It can get rowdy here with all the different games going on (ping pong, beer pong, flip cup, pool) plus there is usually a younger crowd."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,In town for a getaway weekend and wanted to try The Neighborhood.  Walked up about 6ish and everything was locked up tight.  No signage to indicate if temporary or permanent closure.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Stumbled over here at around 4pm on a Thursday. The place was pretty dead with the exception of a few people. Happy hour was already in effect. $4 you call it drinks and draft beers. WOW. Even a grey goose and red bull. 

The place had 2 large rooms...one housing the bar, buck hunter, and  a pool table...and another with seating and ping pong tables. Outside was a HUGE patio with stools and numerous BEER PONG tables. This place must be packed at night. Seems like a cool place to hang out with friends.

They had about 4-5 non-standard beers on tap including Alaskan IPA, and Ranger IPA.  Nice.

You can get wasted here on the cheap. I'll definitely come here again next time I'm in SB."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"The NEIGHBORHOOD CORNER BAR ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Their happy hour is the greates and the drinks are strong AS F*@K... I had 2 shots of patron a 16oz Dos Equis and stolicranberry all for $20.

They have all kinds of games i.e. pool table , 2 ping pong tables, corn hole and fuseball.  They also have a newyly rebuilt deck in the back which is very nice and that is where they host all the beer pong games.

All in All this is a VERY FUN BAR!!! You must visit when in S.B."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Favorite happy hour spot in SB.

Brings out all the best people for all your favorite games.

And no, not a typo, they have ping pong AND beer pong.  The bartenders are great and every one there is having a really good time.

It may help that the pitchers of beer are such a great deal."

pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,This place is the funnest bar in Santa Barbara  county without a doubt! They have something for everyone. The atmosphere can not be beat. The food and drinks are good for the prices.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Love this place. Marcelo is a solid barkeep and keeps the brews coming! If you like bar food, this is the place that will satisfy your craving.  The Tri-tip nachos rule, the portions here are large! 
It's a diveyish atmosphere and if there is a sport on you wanna watch Marcelo is happy to put it on for you. 
Internet jute box for listening pleasure, however music gets turned down when big sporting events are on (which is only right if you ask me)."

pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I had heard about this place and finally had the chance to go. This place is beyond better than a regular bar. There are around 7 legit beer pong tables in the outdoor back area. You can also play corn hole, fooseball, table tennis, and pool. The drinks are suprisngly cheap and still get you drunk. The bartenders and staff were all friendly. What I liked the most was that they'll return your card to you, but you can still keep your tab opened. No more having to go back the next day to pick up your card which happens way too many times to me. After you've gotten drunk make sure to order some food. You wouldn't think you were eating bar food, because of how delicious it is. We had the potato skins, mmm delicious and the onion rings with the fries. Don't expect to go there and dance. Although they play good music it's more of a laid back place where you go to have a good time and get super drunk with friends. Defintely going to be going to this place a lot! The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the bathrooms were not as clean as they could have been, but it's not stopping me from going back!"

pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I spent a happy afternoon/evening here at the Neighborhood being a literal and figurative bro. Literally because I was with two of my sisters, and figuratively, because we played ping-pong, drew on the walls with chalk, and watched some cornhole action out back. (Get your head out of the gutter, it was just bean-bag toss, pervs.)

Yeah, this is a quintessential bro bar with bar games, and cheap cheap prices. How can you go wrong with a happy hour that lasts 'til 8pm, including several food deals? And if you check in with your Yelp app, you get $1 off after happy hour ends. 

Minus 1 star only because I overheard what suspiciously sounded like a textbook drug deal being conducted in the patio out front."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,This place was very sports orientated which I loved. Tvs everywhere and great happy hour prices. We just dropped in on a Monday and this were a little mellow but the bartender was awesome and also the cook. We order a few things from the menu and everything was great. Nice size protions and everything was hot and delicious. Yes I would definitely comr back here. Outside there are beer pong tables and other games for you liking. Love love loved the outside atmosphere. Keep up the good work. We need more bars like this elsewhere
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,This was a all around kool bar!! Friendly staff and awesome games!! Love the beer pong section in the back!! Great to come with a group or even a couples nite!! Nice and clean and fun ambiance!! Nice and big TVs to watch the game!!
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"The neighborhood is a great place for good drink prices and good food. I love its relaxed feel and fun atmosphere. I come here very often and have always had great service from the bartenders, who are friendly and quick. I am only giving it four stars because every time I order nacho fries with jalapenos, I never get my jalapenos. I have asked and been told they don't have any or just plain snubbed. I have had to physically bring a menu over and show them that they are on the menu and then finally I get some. I don't really understand what is up with that. I can't imagine that they are very expensive. This has happened with one of my friends and BBQ sauce as well. He asked the bar back for BBQ sauce and was promptly told they were out and of course they weren't. So I'd have to say drink service is great but food service is hit or miss. It was really busy when this happened each time so maybe it was just because of that."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"To me it seems obvious to awake from my yelping dormancy to write a review about a place I find myself far too often, The Neighborhood.  Why do I love this bar.  Because it reinforces every deadly sin slash vice I have.  

Gluttony:  I have eaten way too much delicious, cheap, well-prepared food.  How could I resist a litany of appetizers under $5?  I have also gone all out and ordered the pizza.  The Neighborhood has played a large role in me not being able to rid myself of cellulite and love handles.  The next vice you ask?  

Sloth:  Not only does the Hood provide me decadent eats, it provides me with much cheap alcohol.  I usually drink so much that I am rendered useless the next day and laze about.  

Wrath and Pride:  On top of booze and food, there are a myriad of games to choose from.  As I lose a game of cornhole I begin to get upset and yell a variety of epithets at my opponent.  I also find myself boasting if I find myself suddenly winning.

Lust:  As I down my drinks I suddenly find a lot of the people in the bar a lot more attractive.  And you know the rest is... history.

God forgive me, but I love coming here."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,The Neighborhood is the most fun bar in Santa Barbara. It's a great place to meet with your friends and play some drinking games. The food is the best bar food in Santa Barbara. They have great drink specials and the bartenders are always friendly and quick.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"My friends and family took me here for my ""Jack & Jill"" Party with the fiance a few weekends ago. The drinks we're great - soooo great that I felt it the next morning. :P 

From what I recall, there were fun games like foozeball, ping pong, and even beer pong! I know my soon-to-be hubby had a great time with the games. I particularly enjoyed chatting it up with everyone and writing all over their chalkboard walls. 

I hear the food wasn't bad either. I just don't remember what I ate. :P

In all, I'd go back again if I were in town!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"One of the cheaper bars in an extremely expensive city. Away from State so mostly locals. Lots of games: pool, beruit tables, corn hole, and PING PONG TABLES!! Decent bar food. Can't beat it on a Wednesday night."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"New favorite bar, too bad I don't live in Santa Barbara.  

Found out about this place from Yelp (don't be shocked) and decided to check it out.  I was by myself for a nighttime bike ride around town and cruised in.  When I was walking into the bar it was spewing heavy metal from the jukebox.  Whatever, bring the metal get angry.  Besides I'd already locked up my bike.  Went it and was pleased to find the next hour of music was all Grateful Dead, yes!  
  They have multiple happy hours (including a late night happy hour) daily deals on drinks/food.  And their bar food is pretty freakin good!  
  Best things about this bar, 3 different Buck Hunter machines side by side, ping pong tables (everyone Yelps about this one I know) awesome bar food, strong pours of whiskey, and tall boys of PBR.  That last one brings warmth to the heart of this Wisconsin boy.
  Maybe it just seems like a breath of fresh air because The Neighborhood is truly a neighborhood bar, which I love, and after spending my days working a corporate event at a resort, spending some time here makes my soul feel good."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Tried this place for the first for football on a Sunday and it was great!

After watching Jason Mraz perform live at the SB Beach Festival last Friday some of the girls and I decided to go bar hopping on State St. 

Yay~! Jason~! Sorry...had to get it out of my system.

Anyway, we kinda stumbled upon this place on our walk to State St. We walked in and it was as if the music stopped and some aliens walked in. Well, first of all...it was because it was mostly guys in this joint and second because...apparently, 4 Asian girls in this place is not a very common thing. 

It seemed like a pretty chill place to hang out. Just your typical ""neighborhood"" bar with ping pong tables and video games. It was only $16 for 2 beers and 2 Goose and bulls~!! It's either this place is really cheap or we got hooked up. 

Unfortunately though, because of the douchebag-esque crowd, we bounced after one drink."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Nice bar with cheap drinks.

Pretty good value/price

We were looking for a place to eat and we found it walking in the street. 

The wings are awesome! And the curly fries too! The portions are huge. The burger is delicious. Good meat! Everything is good in this place."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Best food in Santa Barbara. Favorite spot to be before going downtown later in the night
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"This place is great for happy hour, the best one might say...

I almost shit myself when I realized that these generous bartenders allow you to order any drink you would like for the bargain basement price of $4.  Yes, that is right folks! You want a Grey Goose and tonic? 4 bucks... How about a nice big glass of Knob Creek?  That's only going to cost you 4 smackers...How about something classy like a glass of Hennesey? 4 dollar make you holla...

Oh well so you need some food to settle that stomach?  They got you covered on that too.  How about a steamy hot pizza pie? 4 dollars you say...  I know those big ol' samaches are more then 4 bucks.  You are wrong again, those will only lighten you pocket of 16 quarters.

All that drinking and eating now you are feeling bored.  Well you too can take a beating on the FREE ping pong tables as I did not but 24hours ago.  Ping Pong not your game, well soak in some sports on a LG flat screen (LG pretty classy) .  Oh did I mention that the flat screen is outside on their spacious patio area.  

This place is dope, and I just discovered it like a lame.  

**If you are a tourist or and asshole please don't come to this place, you will not enjoy it."

pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I enjoyed the Neighborhood Bar & Grill!

Food was good and inexpensive as were the drinks.  Washington Apple shots were delicious and so were the Long Islands and Blue Hawaiin Margaraitas.  The bartenders, Brett & Matthew I believe his name was, were great!  They were friendly and attentive.  The bouncer/doorman, I think Bryan, was sweet as well.  This creepy old man kept harassing me and my friends and Brett and Bryan made sure he was thrown out.  Thank yaaaa for that.  

I believe that creepy old man had a glass thrown at him by a fed up patron.  That's karma for yo ass!

Lol, Santa Barabara."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Great bar. Just a couple blocks from the Funk zone and shopping on state street, but just far enough away to be a quiet spot to check out. Good beer and tasty food. Indoor and outdoor seating with many TVs, pool tables, darts, foosball, and beer pong tables out back."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I came here on a Saturday night looking to have a drink and hang out with my girlfriend. The first thing I noted about the Neighborhood is that it is filled with a lot of locals. Not a bad thing because pretty much everyone in Santa Barbara is fun to hang out with. The place was pretty packed and I checked in on Yelp to get $1 off a drink. Small incentive, but hey, worth it. Even though it was past the 11:00pm deadline, the bartender accepted it without question.

I ordered two Jack and Cokes and it cost me all of $12, what a deal! There were TV's, pool tables, and a ping pong table. The fun? Outside in the back yard. Once you get out there, you get a very laid-back feel -- almost as if you're hanging out at a house party. String lights around the walls, 6-8 beer pong tables, a game of corn-hole (slanted boards with a hole in the middle and bean bags you throw at your targets), and another large TV. The whole back wall is converted in to a chalkboard and there are fun messages and tallies of games past.

This is not a club and while they play music, I can't say this is a place I would choose to dance at. However, it is a wonderful bar. There is a friendly vibe about the place and it's easy to hop onto any game you might be interested in. Cheap drinks, good people, fun time. What's not to like? I felt like a local at The Neighborhood!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"A great place for large groups and cheap food (during happy hour).  Happy Hour, which I believe is 4-8, offers half off appetizers, pizzas, and other entrees the chicken quesadilla, which I usually get, along with the house white wine.  My friends love the pizzas, which look kinda greasy but good.  There is a front and back outdoor area, and a large indoor area.  Ping pong tables are available inside and outside.  It's never too busy here, so a great place for lots of friends."

Chill at ""The Neighborhood""!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,I'm definitely down with this place. I was visiting SB with some friends for one night only. We had been to a show at the bowl and were pretty tuned up when we decided to stop by and close out the evening. It pretty much satisfied all my needs. Enough entertainment to keep me interested and the crowd didn't make me feel too old or too young. Nice patio. I will be back.

pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"The bartender on Tuesday at 7pm was an  incredibly LAZY bartender.  Even though there was only 6 people at the bar,  I still had to get my own food from the kitchen.   When I started eating,  I had to flag him down from his conversation for some napkins, which he didn't have any behind the bar,  and he told me I had to go get them myself.  (What bar doesn't have napkins?) Thankfully,  another bar patron gave me his extras that this same bartender gave him.  Very inconsistent service! I would not recommend this day/ time to go"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"If you're looking for fun check this place out! Very fun-loving atmosphere and we ended up making friends on the fly. Hoppin' music and loads of games available. I saw table tennis, beer pong and arcade machines, there may be more that I missed! They have chalkboard walls everyone has written and doodled on and the deals on the shots were good. We went for happy hour but frankly I thought it was a little overpriced for what you got (6 wings for $8? Yikes.) The food WAS good, though, just not the deal I was expecting based on other reviews. I can't fault the place, though, they were great and we had a great time. Go if you're looking to make easy friends, play some games and drink!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Cool neighborhood bar that you can spend all night at. The wings are awesome- pizza too.

Thank you for a wonderful evening guys and we will be back!!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"The neighborhood is the perfect place to watch sports. They have indoor and outdoor TVs. They also have beer pong tables, corn hole, ping pong, and pool. The food is typical bar fare and not cheap (ex: pizza, chicken fingers, sandwiches, burgers wraps).  I think my chicken fingers/fries were $11. The sweet potato fries, curly fries, and waffle fries are bomb. Get anything but the regular fries and you will be happy. I don't think the wine selection is very good (which is understandable because I doubt many people order wine at a sports bar but I wish the few they had were better). Over at the neighborhood 2.0  they have some wine on tap. Most people will be happy though with their full bar of liquor and beer."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Such a fun environment!! So many different activities to do while enjoying a cold brew! I definitely recommend for a weekend afternoon and a pitcher of beer to accompany your corn hole or for beer pong in the back!
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"One of the best dive bars I've been to.  Had pool, ping pong, buck hunting and cheap beer, what I like to call a perfect storm."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS! This is the place you go when you just want to drink (aka get drunk haha) with all your friends! They have video games, ping pong tables, and beer pong tables for you to have fun with. The food isn't bad here either...be sure to order a pizza, or two."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,Annoyed when the bartender steals money from their customers. Watch out and count your money correctly when paying.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Ping pang all day!!! Good beer, good bar food, ping pong tables, tvs, front patio for people watching, fooseball, and back patio with beer pong tables.

Great place to relax, have some drinks, and have fun.

Close to the beach too. My favorite bar in Santa Barbara."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"David at the neighborhood is the best!! He goes out of his way to be friendly and make sure everyone has a great time! He's a perfect example of a hardworking, awesome employee!!! Would go back to the neighborhood just to hang out with this guy!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Man am I glad i stumbled upon this place last night...Thank you Yelpers for your great reveiws...it sold me.  Had a great feeling about this place as soon as I walked in and saw the Pabst everywhere.  Plus they have ping pong, fooseball, and a huge patio.  Great place to hang with freinds and watch the games..TV's everywhere.  The food was ok, but its bar food and get you full"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Great sports bar! And I mean sports. This place has ping pong and corn hole! With a beer pong chaser! Brett and Marcelo behind the bar keep the beverages and conversation delicious!
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,Bad food. Avg drink. Nice vibe. Cheap
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"EFF YEAH!

Here is a re-cap of our time at the hood:

We ordered one giant draft beer, one normal sized draft beer and a shot of whiskey. The bartender tells us that it'll be $14. Maybe we've been living in LA too long, but we were shocked at such a low number for quality craft beers and decent whiskey. There were several rounds of this, and they were all full of win! 

I LOVE bar games. I'm pretty sure I may have been conceived in a bar because the only talent I came out of the womb with is being able to play all bar games fairly well. They have a tornado foosball table (no cheap plastic guys here!), two ping pong tables, beer pong tables, darts, pool and CORNHOLE! Yes, I felt like I was in college again and I loved it!

We decided to sit out on the front patio with the grown-ups and ended up making friends with some very cool local guys who almost talked me into moving to SB and gave us a ride to the bowl to catch a concert. Who does that?!

We took a cab back after the show, which worked out unbelievably well since we were in desperate need of fun food. Their waffle fries and BBQ chicken pizza totally hit the spot.

I love the neighborhood, and the good people of SB!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"1. They have BIG BUCK HUNTER PRO. Hunting without really killing anything... other than my soul because I suck. They also have other fun games like ping pong and foosball but I suck at both those games, too.
2. Santa Barbara cab numbers written on the chalkboard walls... 
3. Ample seating
4. Fun and different (and sometimes not-so-different) music. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a little T-Pain but sometimes ya just wanna hear some old school Michael Jackson
5. All of the above and below.
6. During my most recent visit, I got a Vanilla Stoli and Ginger Ale for $4 (pre-tip) which got me pretty tipsy/extremely happy.

So basically, I love this place. A good night = Press Room + Cab Ride + Neighborhood + Chili Cheese Fries 4rm Mad Dogs + Sleep"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"cool bar! fun crowd! ping pong tables and cornhole open in the back. good beer prices, and col bar tenders..."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Came here late last night for some grub and beers. Bartender was super chill and friendly. We ordered buffalo wings, a greek salad, a bbq chicken sandwich, and curly fries (along with a couple beers). Food came quick and was delicious. Would definitely recommend for good bar food and fun environment"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"We have been going to the Brewhouse for years, but had not stopped by the Neighborhood next door. Knowing that the Brewhouse is very noisy on a Sunday evening, we elected to stop by the Neighborhood.  The Neighborhood is a bar that served food. You order the food at the bar and you are notified when it is ready by one of the handheld devices that light up (that is if it is working). Ours did not work, but the bartender brought our food out to us. The burger was excellent as was the taco salad. The chicken quesadilla was  short on the chicken, but did include avocado and Pico de Gallo. As this is pretty much serve yourself, service was good. They have a good selection of beer on tap. There was plenty of seating outside."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Fun bar, lots of tv's and games to keep you busy. The bartender was very good and very friendly. I'll be coming back. Plus they have a jukebox, so play whatever you want."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Friendly staff. Friendly patrons. Chalkboard walls. Big patio. Off the strip. Beer pong. Inexpensive happy hour. The Brewhouse next door. The Neighborhood: The best all-around bar in Santa Barbara.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I use to live right around the corner from the hood--this was my local pub and I miss it! The atmosphere is really laid back and a lot of locals hangout here. The food is also really good for being a bar! Try their pizza, buffalo sandwich or wings. They run pretty good drink specials all the time, so it's worth a shot to check this bar out."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,Cool place for a nighttime outing. Very friendly bartender and excellent wings. Not real comfortable for a dayime stop or to really have a meal. If you like beer pong then you are golden.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,So many games and great drinks! David was the best! Welcoming staff ... Such a fun night
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,4 stars for the concept. 1 star for the execution. Great prices. Drinks not so much. Drunk bartenders who don't charge the right prices.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Friendly staff and people. Food service is a bit slow but over all I would recommend.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,The bartenders were not friendly... aka they were assholes. Not somewhere I'd hang out
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"This is for Neighborhood 2.0? I think? The narrow bar in-between Neighborhood and  the Brewhouse? 

One reason to go - when Jeff is bartending! My friend lives in the area and he recommended we go there and wait for him to get home. Damn Jeff made our night fun! He introduced everyone walking in to the place to each other - he made it more fun than I ever thought we could have in a sports bar. We thought we were just stopping in for one drink - stayed for many. Excellent time Jeff! You rock!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"Let's just say I'm glad I don't live in this 'Neighborhood'. Definitely a place to go if you're under 25, if you're like me and well over 25, don't bother.
I say it's A-OK because it was a lively place with a lot of alcohol flowing and people were having fun, I'll give them that."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Great cheese burger and onion rings.  Beer is cold and the place is great. Will be back when I'm in Santa Barbara.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Mmm my mai tai with fresh pineapple juice and a pineapple slice was delicious. 

I came here for a work get together and had a blast! The beer pong tables are legit with official dimensions: 96"" x 24""′ x 27.5″ (long and skinny!). I also enjoyed the ping pong and pool.

It looked like mostly dudes hang out here. It's a bit of a shame, but if you have a group this is a fun place.

Pizza was aight."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"The bouncer and bar manager weren't familiar with the District of Columbia (a/k/a Washington, DC). Accordingly, they thought our licenses were fake ones from the country of Colombia, and they threatened to confiscate them. 

To be fair, they appeared to be higher than a kite. But still...

This is not a dive bar; it's an awful bar. I can see why that has appeal to young white people in a place like Santa Barbara, but they're kidding themselves if they think this is a cool place. It's in a strip mall for %#^*s sake..."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Best bar food I have had in Santa Barbara. It is the best place in Santa Barbara to watch NFL. Unfortunately, the crowd can sometimes consist of total scumbags and bathroom coke heads. If those problems could be eliminated, this place is legendary. If you are a douchebag, you can play beer pong in the back in the outside patio. Great bartenders. Very friendly staff."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,The food was delicious! And the server was attentive and professional! We didn't have to ask for anything he suggested/anticipated our needs. Definitely come back again!
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"We went around 7p on a Friday night, sat at the bar and were served immediately by a really cool bartender.  Decent neighborhood spot with a very casual vibe.  Not a huge selection of beer on tap but I think that has to do with the fact there is a brewery next door.  This would be a fun spot with a group of friends: $2 beer pong.  Need I say more?"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Good happy hour

I came here early one evening for a drink and some chicken wings. While eating my delicious wings i noticed the happy hour specials. It seems like happy hour never really ends until 11pm the drinks then turn to normal prices.

Not a bad place to hang out witg friends, they have pool, fooseball, ping ping tables and a new jukebox."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Came here for happy hour and to watch the hockey/ basketball playoffs. Ordered a Moscow Mule for happy hour was great deal plus open atmosphere of the 2.0 bar. With the connection for he main bar and the food being delivered to the 2.0 side this is a great sports bar for the area. The bartenders name was Preston and he was very helpful in selecting what food to eat or drinks to get for ourselves. Always love a bar that has a personal touch with a friendly bartender: would recommend this place for anyone looking for games. Plus air condition!!!
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Great late night happy hour specials on beer and food. The friendliest bartenders! Mike always has a smile on his face! Awesome place to meet up with coworkers and friends. Always a good time here.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"It's like a frathouse, because there are always bros (and blondes) in the back playing beer pong and cornhole.  There's also a pool table and some ping pong, plus plenty of seating/room to mill about.  The tables are big enough to sit a ton of people around and play a card game.  They have good food, and friendly staff (even if it does take awhile to get served) and great drink specials.  Good times.  Fo sho."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Great place! Very casual. Not a huge selection of beer and mostly unhealthy/fried bar foods, but perfect for a college throwback night. They have ping pong, arcade games, and best of all-beer pong tables in the back. Only problem is the tables are exceptionally long and skinny, so they really aren't great for gauchoball. Really fun environment."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I was in town on vacation and didn't want to go to a normal touristy restaurant The Neighborhood was recommended to me from one of the employees at our motel. We really enjoyed The Neighborhood, The food is your standard bar food, it was good. They have ping pong tables, beer pong tables, and corn hole. Bartenders were friendly."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Awesome bar - very laid back with ""local"" feel.  Love the ping pong table and other games available to play.....felt like my old Fraternity House!  Great drink specials and happy hour food selections.  They have a really good music selection and TVs with sports in the background.  As far as food goes, I had the tri-tip nachos, they were really good. Bartender was very cool and helpful as well."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I work right next door and what can I say.....I love it here. Come on, I mean, they have Big Buck Hunter and amazing outdoor patio areas. The bartenders are usually on top of it...it's a college area and can get super busy. I like that it's kind of a divey feeling bar. They also have munchies available and everything is reasonably price."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Hot damn!! Their pizza is awesome. Their staff is awesome. Carlos is awesome!! Best food and environment in town
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Yes, it used to be that gay bar. Now it's one of my favorite places to go. The Neighborhood is located next to the Blue Collar Bistro (And owned by the same) and the Brew House. Very cool, open atmosphere. They have a digital jukebox for your listening pleasure (or displeasure when some cowboy puts in $20 and plays every song on the album). There are a lot of booths and several flat-screen TVs for you sports fans. The drinks are reasonably priced and you can order food from the Blue Collar Bistro. 

What I like best are the games! They have two ping-pong tables setup in the middle of the bar (in addition to the small pool table). On top of that they have a bunch of random board games for you to play (i.e. Rummicube, Truth/Dare Jenga, Clue, etc.). Usually we'll just cruise down there and get a pitcher or two and play dominoes. But it is a great destination if you aren't trying to go Downtown to the State St. scene. It can get really packed here too on random nights, but I've found that it will usually begin to slow down after 12. All in all it is a great find. Check it.

***December 07 Update: Rendevouzed with my girlfriend in Santa Barbara. We both went to school there and we wanted to get away for the weekend. Kinda over the old hussle and bussle of the usual State St. haunts, we went over to the Neighborhood for a visit. They had some sweet upgrades since the last time I was there. There was a band playing mainly covers inside, but a good mix. What was awesome is that they finally opened up the back patio... AMAZING! They had basketball hoops on both ends of the patio, foosball, ping-pong tables and a bunch of double overhead space heaters. Had a great time and it felt good to be back in Santa Barbara."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,This place is fun but kind of grundgey. Even though it says no smoking on the back patio they let people chain smoke to their hearts content (AKA you will have to shower and wash all of your clothes when you get home b/c you will smell like an ash tray). I do like the beer pong and their drinks are relatively affordable.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I love the ambiance of this lounge, the food, service, and beer was great, the music is poppin!!!!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"happy hour is great if you make it. Ping Pong and karaoke usually fill this place up with an interesting mix of older folks and college kids. They have a kitchen that serves food and they have TVS and pool too! Not located within the downtown digs of State St., this crowd seems to be a lot more mellow. They have a decent sized front patio with heaters and lots of seating so large groups are definitely welcomed. The walls on the inside are decorated with colored chalk scribbles and if you get too drunk to drive, they have nicely inscribed on the walkway above the entrance with chalk, several phone numbers to local taxi companies. Fun place."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"A fantastic happy hour!  Beer pong in the back.  Pool tables and dingyness.  Strong pours and good looking coeds.  Great prices.

And just the right amount of dank."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"This place is great! Best happy hour and good food!. Great to watch the games even play games, beerpong, ping pong, pool and some days kareoke. Beyond all that the service is great All the guys are helpful quick and respectful. Marshall stood out the most very attentive and always has a smile. Even remembered my name. Like I said great place!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"There is nothing they can do to this place to get me to give it five stars!    It just isn't a five star kind of place if you know what I mean.    As far as I am concerned they do it all right and they have the highest score possible for a somewhat divey neighborhood bar.    

I go there once a month for trivia which is outside on the patio.   We gather around six or seven beer pong tables, that should be enough to get them their first star!  Official beer pong tables!   Lucky's should have that!   In addition they have some video games, a pool table and a couple of ping pong tables.    It is kind of a bar/arcade.     

The place is pretty chill.   Seems to be locals only and has it's share of regulars.   Happy hour is good.  Drinks are cheap and good and there is actually quite a variety of food.    Appitizers, Pizza, sandwiches and salads.   I am surprised that the food is very well cooked and tasty.   Amongst the salads and sandwiches there are even a couple of healthy options.    Don't get me wrong, the Brewhouse next door has better food at higher prices but for what it is, this place is really darn good! 

Like I said, they can't really do anything better and still be the bargain that they are.   While I would encourage the tourists to try just about anything else that Santa Barbara has to offer, let's keep this place just to ourselves!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"One of the hidden gems of the funk zone, and get this, not overrun by douche bags in Affliction shirts, in all of the dozens of times i have been here, i have never once had a bad time. Pool, beerpong, trivia night, cornhole, there's always something to do while getting hammed with buddies and strangers. They have the BEST happy hour downtown, great food (a buffalo chicken pizza i would kick my grandmother for a slice right now.) friendly bartenders and staff, and stiff drinks! YEAH. You will find none of the condescending douchebaggery you find on State, and will go home tipsy, happy, and might even have enough cheddar left over to pay rent!

OH AND THE JUKEBOX! bring on the good tunes!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,I was visiting from out of town and wanted to watch the playoff games at a cool bar with good drinks and good food and this place fit that exactly. Tri-tip nachos were amazing. Nice beer selection as well.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"Bartender & co. were awful employees. Rude, egotistical, and completely out of line. The bar itself is a great set up however, the employees were some of the rudest encountered. I would NOT recommend this bar as Santa Barbara has so many other great options to offer. Please think twice before giving this establishment business."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"State St. is filled with overly crowded, overly dressed, overly priced bars and clubs to satisfy the masses of college students and young professionals alike. However, The Neighborhood is easily one of my favorite bars in Santa Barbara, conveniently located NOT on State St. 

I used to come here frequently as a student at SBCC... And still pop in while visiting to partake in some debauchery with the locals. The Hood is a very casual place with a local-y feel... A great alternative to the herds of college chicks in mini dresses/heels tromping down State St. The crowd is diverse and interesting, totally approachable and fun. 

They have ping-pong, pool, buck hunter, a plethora of beer pong tables and even corn hole! The happy hour deals are awesome and the food is actually really good. (I believe their happy hour even goes until 9pm!!)  The beach is only a couple blocks away and the neighboring Brewhouse is always alive with Santa Barbarians.

Some of the bartenders can come off as arrogant and cocky, even if you know them by first name and tip them well. It's hard to blame them after seeing some of the crap they put up with from drunk patrons, though! Long hours and rude customers will put anyone in a bad mood! 

All in all, this is an awesome place with awesome people. If you're in Santa Barbara and looking for a place to drink that doesn't have the touristy appeal of State St. I would highly recommend popping into The Hood for some food, fun, and alcoholic beverages."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"My phone died and I needed to do a review for my bar keep Jeff AKA ""starky""!
He is a bar monster and really made our groups night! Fast service and super frien! Ly!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"I came here after dinner next door at The Brewhouse on a Tuesday night. It was a very nice, chill atmosphere. We played the hunting games, which are quite popular there."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,Not what it use to be. No food happy hour. Generic beer menu from Budweiser. Wish times didnt change.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"I love the atmosphere in this place, very laid back.  Probably the few places, maybe the only place in the area, where there is an outside area to play various drinking games.  I also LOVE their pear and gorgonzola pizza!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"This is an inexpensive, run of the mill, neighborhood bar. I walked here after reading all of the hype on Yelp and hearing from locals that it's a great place.

What did I miss?

Sure, 15 beers on draft is great, but when your best beer is Alaskan IPA, you're not setting the bar very high. In their defense, most of the patrons here were ordering tall cans of High Life and PBR. They had a great happy hour of $4 u-call-it's so I had a Belvedere rocks and took off.

While I was there, I glanced at the menu, consisting of fried foods, checked out the beer pong tables, and watched some guys play ping pong. OK.... give me something unique to prove that you're a good bar like everyone says. 

Overall, it's an ok place to drink if you live in the neighborhood, but this is by no means a great bar. The amateurs drinking here need to see a good bar."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"After spending the entire day, 4/30/16, in bed with a monster cold, by late afternoon I was getting pretty hungry. My wife walked the short distance from our hotel to pick up our orders. She had the Tri-tip Sandwich with a Side Salad, while I chose the Cheese Burger with Fries. Large portions and way more fries then I could possibly eat, especially being so under the weather. And after putting the sauce on my burger, I was left with a runny mess. The burger became one sloppy handful to deal with. It tasted alright but nothing spectacular. And I guess I wasn't as hungry as I thought since I was barely able to finish half of my order, I didn't bother to save the rest but trashed it. My wife was a bit underwhelmed with her Tri-Tip as well. But they are conveniently close to Inn by the Harbor."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Full of neon writing, loud music, games (ping pong, beer pong, all kinds of pong), giant rooms, cheap drinks, and people born at the peak of Mariah Carey's career, it's like something out of Tijuana (in a good way).  All it needed was someone selling bacon-wrapped dog parts and Chicle outside the door.  Watch out for the curvy Jen.  I think she gets off by beating out of town guys in ping pong in front of their girlfriends.  She was good.  She was like Forrest Bumps."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,This place was so nice I went twice. I was in town for the weekend. We went to the brewhouse for dinner and wanted to a few drinks. This place was chill. The people was friendly and the beer was good. Then I went back in the morning to watch the football game. There are lots of tvs and a good menu for breakfast. Overall enjoyed the time we spent here it reminded me of the bar I go to at home.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"I would not say that this is one of my favorite spots compared to everything else Santa Barbara has to offer. This is the type of place that I would go to once I am already drunk and ready to play some cheap beer pong or corn hole with some friends.

This is definitely more of a college crowd/young twenties type of bar with not the classiest type of clientele. However, if all you are looking for is cheap booze and some drinking games then this is the dive bar for you."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"The Neighborhood is a funky little dive bar located just off of state street in Santa Barbara.  Prices are RIDICULOUSLY cheap here for booze.   For example, they were running a special where you get two shots of whiskey for $5.  They also have a decent selection of local brews like Firestone and Figueroa Mountain.  The back of the bar also contains beer pong tables, 2 ping pong tables, and one pool table.  

Beware though, as with all cheap booze places, this place also includes bros (the dudes that drink straight out of the pitcher).  But not just any bros, bros that are past their prime as well.  If you're a lady, get your F-off stick ready.  And if you're a guy, ignore eye contact with a select few that think they're John Cena (no joke, ask me if you're curious).  Even though you'd be able to knock their drunk @$$ out with one punch, you probably don't want them to puke on you.

Other than that, cheap booze is what it's all about here.  Oh, and forget about taking a dump...unless you wanna sit on a lid lined with puke..."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Came her on Saturday night for a meet the UCSB grads party. CHEAP drinks, but kind of crappy beer selection (oh well, they had pacifico), GREAT happy hour ($4 you call it's!) and cheap food. Beer pong in the back, video games in the front. I suspect this will be a new fave place to go when we move to SB in July :)"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Looked a little dicey walking up to it at night but glad we went inside.  Everything about the bar feels right on the inside.  A fun atmosphere with plenty of TVs to see the sports you want.  Great service from the friendly helpful bartender and the Cobb Salad was one of the best I have ever had.  I will for sure be going back here.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Great place to have a beer or an amazing Mai Tai!  Friendly bartender and personable owner.  Great onion rings and hot hot wings!  Big plus is the hooks under the bar to hang the backpack.  Bartender Brett was totally cool; had tips for the local Santa Barbara restaurants and wasn't shy about giving us the 411 of local places.  Have to give a big 'ol 5 star shout out for the Neighborhood Bar!  Whoot!
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"I came here with some friends while I was in town. What a great place to hang out! 
I really enjoyed the random songs and the jukebox and playing beer pong outside.
But sadly, I did have a negative experience which caused me to knock down two stars. When I checked in I saw that they had a yelp deal which would give me a dollar off of a drink of my choice. I presented this to the bartender and he gave me a rude look, along with a huff and asked ""How many times have you already used this?"". Why offer a yelp deal if you're going to give me attitude when I attempt to use it? Not nice Mr. Bartender!! 
I'd still come back and hope for a better experience. The appetizers I tried were delish. Nachos and waffle fries. Great bar food."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"This place is pretty cool considering their committment to Buck Hunter the video game. Plus, the Beirut tables out back really tie the room together."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,Fun place for drinks on our first visit to Santa Barbra. The food was really good as well. Lots of games to play.
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Awesome place, took great care with amazing drink specials. Brett was my bartender and he was amazing. Recommended the best drinks and helped me out with the beer pong cups. Will come again!"
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,positive,"Pretty cool place to come and hang out with your friends.  This is a typical bar that you think of from the movies.  They have ping pong, pool and a fuze-ball table.  The people their are pretty nice and they have TVs all over the place for watching sport events.  The bartenders are nice and the drinks are pretty reasonable."
pqF3WkYktbR28uk2PSR7Rg,The Neighborhood Bar,American,negative,"I give this a 3 1/2.
Free ping pong.  Anything free is awesome! ;)
The cheap food and drinks are great too.  Although their water had a funny taste... Hmmm...
I enjoyed their burger, corn dog, and taquitos!  Yum yum yum... only $4 during their happy hour. It can not be beat!
The place is a bit dark...but it's one of those hole in the wall bars that you have to be in the mood to chill with...it's all about chillin' and enjoying the moment..."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Tried this place after countless times walking by. Got the staff recommended Mediterranean Bowl. Very tasty. Pleasant well-trained employees. Nice IV atmosphere. 
Mediterranean bowl: Hummus, grilled onions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, baby kale/greens,avocado, feta cheese, basil pesto drizzle"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,These bowls are the best on a cold day. I got the shroom bowl and it hit the spot. I spoke with the owner the bit who is a really cool guy. They always play cool music and the place is very clean
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Basically everything here is so good! I would recommend my favorite, the ""Hangover Bowl"" that I believe is on their secret menu. One of my favorite restaurants in IV!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Great food and workers. Prices are high, but it's IV so thats pretty common. If you can afford this place it'd definitely recommend it."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,This place is literally a dream I had and when I found out it existed I exploded! So good! Glad I don't live in the area or I wouldn't be able to contain myself. Bread bowl lovers... this place is for you. The staff was so friendly and helpful as well!!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Buddha Bowls is wonderful. The fact that it is truly a local UCSB buisness makes it even better. I enjoy that the staff is super friendly, and water is always free. Word of caution though, it is almost impossible to finish an entire bowl sober. So either go after a super fun night out or even better bring a date. There tons of nice seating indoors and out."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Hi there!

This place has a great selection that goes beyond the menu posted. Nice vibe! I highly recommend the melon bowl.

CHECK this place out. SUPER DANK!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Buddha Bowls is a fantastic addition to out Isla Vista community! Not only is it completely original but the food is also very affordable and tastes AMAZING. If your looking for something different and satisfying definitely go to Buddha Bowls. Theres tons of different options depending on what your feeling like and there is no doubt that you will leave wanting to come back again. This spot is definitely my new GO TO place! my friends and i are very impressed by the establishment :)
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"I've been here twice to try their amazing looking bowls and soup. Both times I stopped eating after 2-3 bites:/ I personally did not like it at all, but not saying you won't"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I LOVE bread bowls, but I've never had anything other than creamy soups inside them. This place definitely exceeded my expectations with a Mediterranean salad cuddled inside bread! 

There isn't too much seating within the establishment most people seem to take their order to-go, which is definitely recommended if you're a busy student. A very casual place to take your friends and the staff are super friendly. Aside from having the bread bowls, you can also have your order in sandwich or salad form I believe.

Super filling and great value for the price! You can also ask for the part of the bread that they pull out to make the bowl at no extra cost -- woottt!

Order:  Mediterranean salad?? on sourdough bread --- there is plenty of pesto, I almost think it's overwhelming, but I really like pesto. I think it's one of the less heavy options for the bread bowl combinations and it was quite delicious.
             BLAT sandwich --- this combo works well! you can taste all the flavors. Not as much food though.
             MacDaddy on sourdough bread --- so good, instant food coma. Couldn't finish."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Loni was the greatest server I've ever met. She made the experience here amazing and without her I'm not sure if I'd ever return. Thank you Loni and your amazing food you served me.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,I just found out this place existed. I absolutely love it. I tried the mac daddy bowl on wheat bread and some cheesey sticks. It felt like I died and went to heaven. It was perfect for a cold day like this. My bf got the hangover bowl and that was delicious too. Fast service. Steaming hot food. And a really relaxing atmosphere.  I couldn't ask for more.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Besides clam chowder, food in bread bowls is a pretty unique concept you don't see everyday. It's cool to have a shop that specializes in bread bowls right here in IV.

First you pick whether you want sourdough, whole wheat, a salad, or a bread bowl sandwich - the Snapwich. Then you choose your sauce, cheese, and vegetables. For $1.50 more, you can add chicken or sausage. Or, you can choose one of their preset combinations such as Mediterranean, Hangover, Pizza, or the Hawaiian BBQ bowls. They also make soup bowls for clam chowder, chili, and tomato basil. I always order the Mac Daddy, which is sourdough bread, mac & cheese, bacon, and cheese; a complete carb overload. Most bowls run around $7-$9, which is pretty high for a meal, but overall reasonable for what you get. The portions are large, and the meal itself is filling.

The sourdough bread is great. They serve it warm, lightly toasted, and well-seasoned. You also receive the piece of bread that was carved from the bowl. The outer shell of the bread is pretty solid, you'll have to use a knife or your hands to tear it apart. If you have sensitive teeth, you might have difficulty chewing.

Service was fine, the workers are helpful and courteous. They are quick at making the bowls, with little wait. There's not a lot of tables inside, but it's nice to sit down and eat while appreciating the decor and the mural on the wall.

If I have to be honest, the bowls are novelty food items. Most of them are not practical meals you can eat daily. However, they're delicious, and that's what matters the most. 

Buddha Bowls offers plenty of deals throughout the year. They do $4.20 specials, $5 Mac Daddy promos, and coupons. It's a steal, you should go right away before the lines get any longer."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Very unique and full of flavor. I had the salad and it was extremely filling but afterwards it got a little too overwhelming because of the portion they gave. Definitely would need to come back to try the main thing...the bread bowl.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"Meh.   The way my fellow Yelpers rated this place you'd think that it was the greatest food in Santa Barbara.     

Cheap eats are a hallmark of college towns.   You'd think Isla Vista at UCSB would have a plethora of great cheap eats near campus.   Walking down the street, I'm reminded of my college days -- beautiful young coeds, bicycles, unbathed hippies, cash starved students, etc.  Where Isla Vista excels in keg studies and beach culture, it lacks in culinary cheap eats IMO (someone please prove me wrong).  It's no Berkeley, that's for sure.    

I was hoping Buddha Bowls would blow my mind away per some of the reviews.   I ordered the Mediterranean bowl and a breakfast sandwich.   The breakfast sandwich ($6) was good but the Mediterranean bowl was nothing to write home about.  All i could think about was that this place must make a healthy profit margin.  I'm thinking the students love it because their appetites are sated after eating here when in reality, that's definitely the case if you devour the bread bowl in its entirety. 

Would I come back here again?  Nope.  Next."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Owners a super chill dude, all the bowls are very very good, everything fresh. Employees are nice and out going with the passion of brightening your day! Just wish the place had some 420 photos or something on the walls would be pretty cool :) Overall definitely one of the best spots in IV! 10/10 Mac daddy add chicken..."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I've tried the hangover bowl and the Mac Daddy with chicken/pesto, and they were both super good. The bread is fresh and they put garlic butter on the top and inside that they rip out before toasting it - delicious. If you like pesto, definitely ask them to put pesto inside the bowl for the Mac Daddy this literally changed my life. The service is great, they'll bring your bowl to you and there isn't a ton of seating but the people working there are so nice."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Excellent good. I had a ""Hangover bowl"" and my wife ordered ""Mac & cheese"". Both bowls were tastes very good!! and large portion. We really want to try another menus."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Been here and back a few times. It's a nice change in texture and flavors from any other restaurant. 

I also always recommend the Hangover Bowl. I've never been as happy with any other order."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Pizza bowl with Sausage is so good!!

My first time going to Buddha Bowls, and I am hooked. Amazon food, wonderful staff and reasonable prices! I will be back soon, ready for more."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Always such a nice atmosphere with really friendly people. The Mac Daddy bread bowl is definitely my favorite. The bread bowls are always perfect and the Mac and cheese just some of the best Mac and cheese I've had. I also love the fact that they supported marijuana legalization. Just a really amazing place over all
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Wow, this place is so good. Ten out of ten would recommend. The way they toast the bread is magical and the different combinations of food you can put inside are delicious. I got the Hawaii bbq bowl and it tasted great!  Service is super friendly as well."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This place is so good. I have known the chef/owner since he opened the place and always wondered why more people weren't in there. He works really hard and goes the extra distance when preparing the food. All of the ingredients are very fresh and high quality, unlike some other places in Isla Vista. All of the combinations available as well as the sides make eating there never boring. Care and effort goes into dish made and honestly I have yet to find a combination of ingredients that didn't taste good. One of the dankest bowls around."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Neat place located in the collage area in UCSB. I guess the main idea is that they serve their dishes in a bread bowl and if you haven't been there before, the menu is really easy to follow. Think subway style of ordering without the nasty customer service. You can create your own dish or order an entree straight from the menu. The food itself was carb overload but tasty! It's very rich and a lot of flavors. It can be heavy but not in a disgusting way. My friend created her own dish with some recommendations from the server. He suggested putting humus is her bowl with whatever it was she was having and it wasn't bad actually. Definitely would love to try their desserts. 

The shop itself looks like it's been open not too long and it was clean. Walking distance from a lot of places. It says it's open late, I imagine for those studious students who stay up late ;)"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Got the $10 mac & cheese. T'was what was expected ... double carbs in a bread bowl. Yummiest part is the cut off top and scooped out middle that they toast and butter. College vibe, yummy bread. Free stickers with that funky green leaf being the most popular."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"really good vegan bowls. relatively healthy, filling, super yummy. one issue i had was, one worker was very uninformed on what was and was not vegan....considering the menu literally invited you to ask for the vegan options i was a tad annoyed. good think it was yummy"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I stopped by while on a road trip through California and really enjoyed this place. I had a Zen Bowl, my boyfriend had a Pizza Bowl and we shared a Volcano. 

The Zen Bowl was great, especially the bread, and the schwarma was tasty as well as the hummus. Cucumbers are always a plus for me. Interesting mix of flavors, but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. I would get it again but I also would like to check out one of the other options, which looked tasty as well. 

The Pizza Bowl (as dictated to me) was ""big and definitely lived up to its name"". I cannot vouch for his sense of taste but he seemed quite happy afterwards so that is always a good sign. He was also satisfied by the amount of food, which is rare because he seems to always be fiending for more food after almost every one of our dinners. 

The Volcano was my favorite (I have an insatiable taste for chocolate and berries) and I honestly would get this every time if I had a bottomless stomach. It is also a cool way to re-use the bread that they dig out of all of the bread bowls, as it would be a tragedy to waste some of that bread, sourdough or wheat. I don't know where they get it but it was phenomenal. 

Overall, good experience, and its variety of flavors could make it good to go to with a group. Definitely worth it."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"The first time I went here I tried the Peace Bowl and the Shroom Bowl.

Peace Bowl:
Savory chicken shawarma served with grilled onions, hummus, cucumbers and tomatoes.

Shroom Bowl:
Sautéed mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes with swiss cheese, basil pesto and a goat cheese crumble.

I think the concept of this place is really cool, especially since you can't really find anywhere that has bread bowls, but I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special or mind blowing. Not to mention, while I understand that the business is fairly new and the employees are very new as well, we noticed a few things: 

A. The employees weren't wearing gloves while preparing any of the food, like ""packing"" the bowl or when they were taking out the inside of the bread bowl.
B. Some of the employees were eating what they had just made to put in our bowls, and one of them even made eye contact with us while they were putting a spoonful of food in their mouth. Kind of awkward.

I know you want your employees to taste everything on the menu if they haven't, because that helps them when customers ask about the different bowls or for recommendations. But they can take a sample and try it in the back where no one can see them, instead of out in front, where anyone can see. But you definitely shouldn't be eating or trying something while you're still making someone's bowl. It's not very professional.

I hear the Mellow Bowl and the Buddha Sticks are really good. So maybe I'll give it another shot."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"I tried a bread bowl here with macaroni and cheese, bacon, tomatoes, and peppers!  All in all, it was good, but nothing extraordinary.  Not sure I would need to visit again - bread bowls are better for soups, so I might go that route instead!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"I went to Buddha Bowls once and left extremely unimpressed and decided I would never go back. I bought a coupon on restaurants.com for a 25 dollar coupon here but they wouldn't accept it when I tried to give it to them. Not that it had expired, but that I had to buy 75 dollars worth of merchandise to get the 25 off. That wasn't what the coupon said when I bought it, but they wouldn't accept it. I had to talk to multiple different workers until I gave up. I mean who would buy 75+ dollars worth of Buddha bowls? Definitely not me. After that, I figured I still would at least try a bowl rather than go somewhere different (big mistake). I tried the BBQ bowl and was extremely unimpressed. There was barely any meat at all and it felt like it was drowning in sauce. There was too much bread, even for the amount of sauce on the bowl. I didn't want to finish it at all and ended up throwing most of it out. It's also not a sit down restaurant, there's only like 4 tables and they're so crowded you can almost touch the people next to you. I guess the only good thing is that it is a student restaurant so prices are pretty low.

Overall: service was rude and useless, ambience is lacking, and food was overrated."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Ever since I arrived at UCSB, I've been trying different restaurants to find the general quality of food here. However, Buddha Bowls I've found to be a cut above everywhere else in IV. Their employees are bright and cheerful every time I go in, even going so far as to remembering my name. Along with great service, they provide fresh, delicious bread bowls of all sorts, from clam chowder to their special Mac Daddy. I'll always love coming here, and plan to be a frequent customer for a long time."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"I like this idea of bowl.

I highly recommend their Zen bowl. 

Definitely going back to this place for another bowl."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Excellent service and a darn good bread bowl. Highly recommend the Mac daddy! I had Italian sausage instead of the chicken and it was amazing. Will return for more!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Really great idea if you like throwing a whole bunch of yummy stuff into an edible bowl, which is pretty much The Dream, amirite? I got the Greek Bowl and it was magnificent in all of its hummus-y and feta-y glory. I also tried the tomato soup that a friend ordered and it was dee-lish!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Yez please, a place I have a craving for sometimes here in IV. I do the Mac daddy with chicken, added three cheeses, caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, bbq and pesto sauce added in the bowl. The tea is good too."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"I expected so much more from Buddha Bowls. The menu items look and sound delicious. I ordered the Mellow Bowl, a half cut mellon with yogurt, honey, granola and fruit. Turned out to look less than appetizing. The staff made it in less than 5 minutes and tasted as if it was made in that time. 

Bottom line: gross. Would not eat there again. I'm actually frustrated on how my bowl turned out because the picture looked amazing. My roommate got a pizza bowl and she didn't like it either. 

Honestly skip Buddha Bowls and go to Freebirds.
I wish I could give it less than one star."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I went to IV for this place.....I never go to IV.....but it was worth it.  Delicious, hearty, and all local ingredients"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"As an olde skool UCSB alum, I stop by campus from time to time to see how things have changed and to see if the place I used to call home still makes me a proud gaucho. 

Of course the eateries more olde school than myself such as Woodstock's will always be classic, but as we all know, college is about exploration and I thought I would try something new. 

One of the new places I stopped by to check out was Buddha Bowl. The guys working here were happy to introduce me and my girlfriend (slightly less of an olde skool UCSB alum) to their food and seemed genuinely happy to serve their product. We ultimately chose the BBQ Bowl. 

The service was quick and although the tables were a bit dirty, I chalked it up to classic IV griminess that I've always come to appreciate and made me feel at home. 

The food was very good and the bread was delicious. One order was more than enough for 2 slinky individuals such as ourselves. I would be very interested to check out the other bowls next time I'm around!!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This place is heaven. Whenever I visit my friend in Santa Barbara, this is our go to place. We've even eaten here 3 days in a row. Service is amazing!!!!! The owner is so friendly and the whole vibe is so chill. Will definitely be returning forever!!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,This is my favorite new restaurant in IV! I was definitely surprised at how delicious everything was. Dope sauce!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"It's good, it's yummy, it's not too pricy. My only issue is that as a vegan, there's basically one, maybe two things I can get... so eating here is repetitive. Granted, I get the same thing literally every time I go to Chipotle, and I don't get tired of that. So maybe these bowls need to just be consumed less often.
Regardless, I do appreciate how they can edit any bowl to your liking."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"A different kind of place to eat. Order the bread howl of your choice and fill it up with whatever you want. Awesome idea, alright food. Carb loading at its best."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This place is smackin, straight fire! I always get the Mac Daddy (sourdough bread bowl w/ Mac n cheese, chicken, n bacon inside)! Highly recommend for that late night tip"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Got the tomato basil soup & honey milk tea, omg I'm in love with the tea it's not overly sweet and it's not too expensive compared to other milk tea options around here. I'm probably going to come here whenever I'm craving a sweet drink in the future. The tomato soup is really good too + they include a slice of cheesy bread  
Also the girls working here were super friendly!! Can't wait to come back for more :-)"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I'm giving it a 4 because my kid loves it.  Me- well, I'll try it again.  I had a Mediterranean salad bowl.  The poor kid making it was obviously new and nervous- had to look at the sign to see the ingredients (which I didn't mind- we all have to learn) but then left off a few items, added onions (which I asked to be left off) and I'm pretty sure the amounts of what he put on weren't right.  The salad dressing came from the fridge which is a good thing- except that the olive oil was fairly thick from the cold and it wasn't very pourable.  Anyway, I'll go back and try something else.  It's just simple, quick food and the prices are pretty fair. The tables could have been wiped down- otherwise, not bad."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"My favorite part about Buddha Bowls is that it genuinely is a really novel and cool idea.

Especially living in IV, I feel like a lot of business owners don't really take risks. Besides Kogiliscious' Korean tacos, most of the food is pretty standard fair. Lots of burritos and burgers and more burritos. Buddha Bowls is a breath of fresh air and really appeals to my inner foodie. I came at one point towards the beginning and there were definitely some kinks to work out, but more recently they seem to really be getting their stuff together. 

I would definitely recommend Buddha Bowls, particularly the peace bowl or the BBQ chicken bowl."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Excellent salads. The dishes are so surprising delicious! I've recommended Buddha Bowls to family and friends.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Owner: 5/5

This place is a must try for people in IV. It's fairly new, so not a lot know about it yet, but the idea behind this place is very unique. You are basically given a bread bowl (like those Clam Chowder bowls you get in Pier 39) and you can add several toppings to the bread bowl (we will get back to this later) 

The toppings are pretty liberal and they were pretty fresh. They pile these toppings over the bowl then put it through a flash oven (like in Subway). Now back to the bread. The bread started out as a bread bowl but after cutting it up and putting toppings on it, it's not even a bread bowl. It's simply just a deep dish pizza in a sour dough bread. 

It's not really a pizza though- it's more than that. My friends and I tried the 'Shroom' bowl, the Pizza bowl, and the Chicken BBQ bowl. The pizza and Chicken bowl tasted like a deep dish pizza but the shroom bowl just tasted weird. 

The food is also pretty expensive, but in line with the other establishments in IV (about $10 for a bowl and a drink. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this place to anyone in IV (especially on Friday nights with munchies) because the food will fill up any college student."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Pizza Bowl & Mediterranean Bowl. You can get 2 sides free as well. Love how different the concept of the place is and how you can customize your bowl. Tastes so great and fresh. Service was very friendly and price is fair.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Compared to the other restaurants in IV, I think Buddha Bowl fares pretty well. You can a filling meal at a decent price and it tastes pretty good. The service is good and nice sitting area inside. 
There's a variety of options for people's different tastes, also a plus."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,This place is great. Here to get niece moved in for school. After all day we selected Buddha Bowl and we made a good choice. Their variety of bowl with or without the bread bowl offered enough choice that each of us very very satisfied. No carbs for me so the salad bowl really hit the spot. And to add there was enough for leftovers. If you are in the area and looking for fresh healthy food try Buddha Bowl.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Best bang for your buck in IV! I almost always have to get a to go box because the portion is so huge. I come here regularly and never leave feeling disappointed. The owner (Dan) is super chill
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Lovely, my wife had the pesto and I had the pizza. Unfortunatly, she's now on a low carb diet and we'll not be enjoying these for some time."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I really loved this spot! Me & my partner were strolling down to find somewhere to eat when we bumped into Buddha Bowls. I hadn't had anything like it before, super yummy. Plus, the customer service was great!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Oh dear god the Mac Daddy is a dish straight from heaven. A friend took me here when I visited recently and I'm strongly considering making the 5 hour drive for these bowls alone!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I LOVE this place. They have so many options and you can really customize it to what you want. My go-to is the Hangover Bowl, which I've actually never eaten while hungover. It's DELICIOUS. The basil sauce elevates everything to a whole new level, and the fried egg on top is a great addition. Their sweet options, like bread covered in Nutella (seriously?! What else could you ask for? Carbs and chocolate, yo!) are also delicious. This is the place I bring out-of-towners for lunch or dinner, and they couldn't be happier. It's an IV institution for sure :)"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"What a fabulous surprise! We were running an errand in Isla Vista and saw Buddha Bowls knowing nothing about it. We were planning to eat at Poke Ceviche (the best poke place ever) but they were closed for a few days following graduation. The manager from The Poke place actually recommended Buddha Bowls to us. What a great place! The guy who helped us explained their menu and for someone who is gluten and dairy intolerant I was elated they could accommodate my dietary needs. The ingredients were fresh, everything was prepared to order, and the flavors were wonderful. My fiancé got the Pizza Bowl which he loved and I had a salad versus the bread bowl option and it was generous and delicious. I will be back!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"Good food but the guy that helped me was an ass. I think he was the owner. I had never been so I asked a question or two and was very rude, acted like he hated his job. Then quit!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This idea is so damn original, I don't know why it wasn't invented before!! It tastes amazing, and the best part is, you get to choose whatever you want to have in the bowl. There are so many options! It's like chipotle, but a bread bowl instead of a burrito. There are options such as vegetables, cheese, meat, and even hummus! They have multiple other things of course..you have to come to check it out for yourself!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Great spot in IV to grab good. Delicious food and a fun atmosphere. What more could you want?
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,The service here is really friendly and they were patient to answer questions I had about the menu. Portions are pretty big and food comes out fast.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"We were driving back from Disney and passed through sb around midnight. We were sure we were going to have to eat some pretty gross fast food with it being so late when I stumbled across this yelp review. The service is awesome, super friendly staff and the food is amazing. For what we would have paid for a crappy McDonald's meal we got real food...after twelve o'clock at night!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,I LOVE BUDDAH BOWLS. Ask them to coat your Mac Daddy in pesto sauce and you'll be in heaven.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"8-22-15 2:30pm The people working here are super dupper nice very appreciative of their suggestions.  Made our bowls that much better. Definitely coming here again.  Oh yeah, Nutella Snaps were a great dessert to our lunch.  Nutella, strawberries, whip cream and a dash of cinnamon on toasted wheat lids. Soo yumm!!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"I went in here on a Wednesday night, wanted to check the place out. 

To be honest, nothing on the menu jumped out at me so I decided to just get the bread sticks. 

My one star review is not really for the food, its really because of how dirty and messy the place was when I came in. 

The tables had crumbs and had not been wiped, behind the counter was just messy and in disarray. The bread in the display case just looked like it had been thrown in there willy-nilly. 

They only had one person working in the store and overall it seemed like they were not capable of running the store on their own. 

It seems like a lot of other yelpers have complained about the cleanliness of the place as well. My advice to people looking to eat at this place? Steer clear, if they are taking shortcuts or being lazy on simple things like cleaning the tables, cleaning their counter or washing their hands before preparing people's meals, then you'd better stay clear of their food, who knows what kind of shortcuts they are taking with their food in the back where no one can see. 

My one star review is for the complete lack of cleanliness at this place. Im not the first and there is no excuse for having a dirty establishment."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"My only problem with Buddha Bowls is the name is rather misleading. I think they just picked it because of the alliteration, and maybe the round ""fat"" cob bread they use. But the food was great, as was the service. Good value options that will leave you very satisfied."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"So this is definitely a place to go once on vacation because it's not health food or something you should get frequently (unless you get the salad option, but for the price I think it's smarter to get what they're known for-a bread bowl). I got a Hawaiian bbq chicken style bowl. The chicken tasted so good. My only complaint was the sour dough. They toasted it and turned it into more of a garlic bread taste when I was really excited for that sour flavor."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This place is where you want to go for soup. I ordered the bowl with tomato soup. First the soup is creamy and flovorful, made my stomach feel alot better. Second the beard bowl, fluffy. Didn't seem like it at first, but fell apart on the inside. Plus they do some type of magic and the top is cheesy and they give you the inners nice and toasty. I live in LA and I would love to have a place like this. They only do one thing, but they do it right."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Tasty, filling, huge portion.. A little obscene but as is everything in IV I feel! Utter madness was a sourdough bowl filled with chili, bacon, Mac n cheese and more cheese.. A once off in town"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I stumbled across this little gem during my walk down memory lane. As an alumni of UCSB, it is always interesting to come back and see how different IV looks each time. There are lots of fancy new apartment buildings and restaurants that always seem to me to be taking away its ""little town charm"". However, I'd say Buddha Bowls is an exception to this!! I walked in expecting to find overpriced food and some indifferent college kid working the counter. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE! The guy at the counter was friendly, courteous, and informative about the menu options. I also discovered he recently graduated from UCSB which basically made him 10x cooler.  He helped me decide between the Vegan Bowl and the Shroom Bowl. I went with the Vegan Bowl and it was delightful! Lots of fresh veggies in a warm bread bowl that is locally sourced (bonus points that he chooses local!). There were lots of flavors that I felt worked together nicely with the veggies like hummus, cayenne pepper, and tahini sauce. YUM!! It was also a FUN dish to eat as I slowly worked my way through, enjoying every bite. I had come in really hungry, but I was definitely full after I finished (don't worry, people--I left some of the bread bowl...it is the New Year after all haha). I got the impression that the owner takes great pride in his business and has put in a lot of effort to ensure it is an affordable and comfortable place to dine. And honestly, you gotta love places that support HEALTHY eating instead of those places that just sell you overpriced JUNK! Did I mention that it cost less than $8 for the bowl?! I live downtown and any bowl like that would have easily cost me $10 or more. Buddha Bowls is a great place and I will definitely be back! :-)"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I have only been to Bhudda bowls twice, but it is definitely going to become one of my main spots to eat out in Isla Vista.
It has a diverse menu, and is much healthier than many of the other restaurants.  I feel particularly well taken care of by the UCSB graduate who owns the spot.  He is dedicated to providing excellent customer service.  The ingredients are always fresh and sustainable, and the atmosphere is laid back."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"Ordered the Peace Bowl which had chicken, cucumber, onions, tomato, and dollop of hummus for about $8.60 including tax. The chicken was realllly dry.

Breadless option costs the same as getting wheat/sourdough.

Overall, I wouldn't come here again. Would rather go to south coast deli for my carb fix."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,The Mac Daddy is my new best friend.  Looking forward to trying more very soon!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This place is awesome! I'm a fan of soup bread bowls so this hit the spot. You get so much food and for a good price, and you can make it however you want. Good, quick service, and very unique idea. Got the Hangover which was soo so good, highly recommend. I'll be back."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Absolutely delicious. Huge, filling proportions. The Mac Daddy (I think that's what it was called) was spot on, but I wish I had added more free toppings on it.

I would definitely recommend sharing any buddha bowl with one other person, unless you are a youngster with a garbage disposal stomach and also have a super fast metabolism. 

Rated four stars, not five, because of the service. The location was not THAT busy, yet the servers were being semi-unfriendly and a little unhelpful. Knowing I had never been there, they failed to walk me through the process of the add on toppings. And when I asked to add a nutella strawberry dessert, they failed to add it to my order.

Nevertheless, the food was great and the next time I visit I hope to try their nutella and strawberry dessert. Until next time!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Love this place!  Great food, good service, and a diverse menu!  I always get the Hawaiian bowl!  Great for hangovers"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Wow. I had the Mediterranean bowl and I added chicken to it because it's vegetarian, as well as extra pesto. It was so so good. I can imagine the other options there are great as well. I want to try the Pizza bowl next time. The wall art was super cool in there, and there was a nice relaxed vibe. It would be a good place to go with a new friend."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"Food was very dry, they didn't tell me there wasn't bacon in the bowl that I ordered until I paid for it and charged me extra for another side instead of subbing it out. And everyone working there acted like they were too cool to take my order. Definitely not going there ever again. Waste of money for sure."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Came in on a random desire to try something different. The idea behind this place is awesome; you can choose from an array of bread bowls and you place whatever sauce, meat, vegetable and cheese combinations you like. I got a pizza like bowl with Mariana sauce, chicken and sausage, spinach, tomato and all the cheeses and was thoroughly satisfied. The owner is also super sweet and enthusiastic on helping you create the perfect bowl. Definitely recommend, they also serve breakfast in cantaloupe bowls with fruit which I will definitely be trying soon."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Really digging the updated menu. Had a chicken BBQ bowl today with mozzarella, pineapple, tomatoes, grilled onions, and mushrooms. Om nom nom! 

Since I usually try to eat vegetarian, my go-to dish is the greens bowl (spinach and kale base rather than sourdough bread bowl) + a metric ton of assorted veggies, topped with some random cheeses.

Owner is friendly, workers are helpful, place overall has a chill vibe.

Highly recommended for those seeking a healthy option under $10."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This place was awesome! Real friendly staff and tasty food. The bowls are mixes of mostly veggies and some meat in a bread bowl, no filler rice or anything. I got the shroom bowl and girlfriend got the BBQ bowl. Both awesome. Great combo deal, drink and a side for added 3.00 when the sides are more just by themselves. Both the volcano and Buddha breads were delicious. All the bread is made fresh in house. Definitely recommending it."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Oh my gosh! You have to check this place out! Amazing (I mean amazing) food; flavor and creativity combined perfectly! The staff is so friendly and can't believe they've only been open for 2 weeks b/c they've got their stuff together. Fun atmosphere, reasonably priced for what you get. HUGE quantities and quality you can't beat!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"Came back to IV after graduating only to find out that they don't have those munchies anymore. I was super disappointed that bruschetta is no longer on the menu. I'll be honest and say I don't remember any of the other munchie items because the bruschetta was the freaking best. Underrated.

Also, the mac daddy isn't really that cheesy so I'm not a fan of the mac and cheese bowl, but the herbs and/or butter or whatever they put on their toasted bread is A+."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Bread bowls probably crafted by Buddha himself. This spot is an instant classic in town and if you haven't tried it you are missing out. Great place to get my New England clam chowder fix and their other bowls only get better! Maybe cool it on the weed references in the menu... I get it appeal to the crowd. But other than that, you can't go wrong with a bowl from Buddha Bowls."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"It is a lot of food! You definitely get your money's worth. I got the pizza bowl with lots of veggies. With all the sauce and veggies it was hard to taste the cheese, I could have done without it. It's also a lot of bread. I'm sure it's an option, but I should have left the top of the bowl behind. I was a little disappointed with the lemonade. The lady helping me said it was definitely not real lemonade. So if you are looking for a lot of food for not a lot of $$$ this place fits the bill"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Walking around Isla Vista looking for something to eat this place caught my eye. I walk in and get greeted by a very kind and down to earth guy behind the counter. I looked lost so he told us about the highlights: the most popular bowls, the build your own bowl and asked if we wanted samples of the soups. I ordered a Mediterranean bowl which has greens, artichoke hearts, olives, hummus, feta, tomatoes and cucumbers topped with avocado and pesto. I asked for additional grilled mushrooms to be added. Oh my gosh was that the best bowl I have ever had ! The pesto was phenomenal ! The inside part of your bowl that gets ripped out gets buttered and seasoned. It's baked and served as a side garlic bread. The service is phenomenal and the place is so chill. They have regular tables, high tables, a couch, a beautiful Buddha fountain and outdoor seating. Great service, great place, and most important great food ! I will sure be back."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"If you like bread bowls this place is the way to go, atmosphere is super chill, portions are large and pretty reasonably priced. This is a fun local spot to swing by with the homies to grab a bite to eat."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Buddha Bowls is one of the better restaurants here in Isla Vista. The set up of the restaurant is simple - you put a bunch of vegetables and meat into a bread bowl, which is then toasted. It's always very tasty and I've never had to wait a long time to get my bowl. Adding chicken and sausage does cost $1 extra, but it's worth it."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Got the Mac Daddy and the cheese bacon dish was to die for. They even take the bread from the center of the bread bowl and but garlic butter on it to have with the dish, must eat when in SB. They have really other good stuff like pizza bowls too"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Bomb food, great service. Make sure if you go to ask for the top of your bowl, and also make sure you get a punch card! I would like it if the punch card were mentioned to customers more... I would've gotten something free by now.

Atmosphere is also really nice, though you have to go across the street to silver greens for restroom."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Nice little unique place in Isla Vista.  Food was DELICIOUS. I customized my bread bowl with all the goodies they had to offer.  The others in my group got the predesigned bowls.  Pricing was decent, the only improvement that I would see is a better selection of drinks."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"It's always nice seeing new places arise in IV. My roommates and I looked forward to trying this place--the pictures look great and the idea of food in bread bowls sounded delicious as well! However, after eating there tonight, I'm sad to say we were a bit disappointed :( 

We ordered:

Zen Bowl : This was filled with chicken shawarma, hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and... I don't remember what else, but in my opinion, the flavors kinda all clashed and the hummus was quite overpowering. We ordered this in the wheat bowl, which I have to say is DELICIOUS! But besides the edible bowl, it was not very great. 

Pizza Bowl + Italian Sausage: We really looked forward to this one--the idea of a warm bread bowl filled with yummy marinara sauce, gooey cheese, spices, sausage, YUM. Unfortunately, it was nothing like we imagined... There was minimal amount of sauce--so little that most of the bread soaked it all up... The fillings--sausage, cheese, roasted red peppers, tomatoes .. they were all just average and nothing that WOW-ed. The sourdough bread, on the other hand was AMAZING! 

Buddha Stix: These were like the tops of the bread sliced up, covered in cheese, brushed with a garlic-olive oil, toasted up and served with warm marinara sauce. This was probably the best thing we had. The sourdough bread was crunchy, yet still warm and a bit chewy and the cheese was melted and stringy. We could slightly taste the garlic olive oil, but it could probably use a bit more seasoning. The marinara sauce wasn't bad, just okay. 

Everybody was nice and friendly and the interior design is nice, but the worst part of our experience was watching them prepare our food... it was kind of gross, to be honest.. We watched the cashier handle money and then proceed to pick food off an order before another person brought the order out... We also watched the person who was preparing the food wipe her nose, tuck her hair behind her ear while prepping the bowls and then brushing her hair back while finishing up a bowl and bringing it out to the customer. I think some gloves are much needed...or at least some more hand washing! 

The concept of this place is great and the bread is really good, but everything else was not impressing.. It's about $8 something a bowl (including tax) and though it looks like a lot, there doesn't really seem to be that much ""filling"" but rather lots of the inside of the bread. If we were to come again, we'd like to try the clam chowder bowl, as something soupier would better fit the bread bowls. I'd really like to try the Mellow Bowl as well, but hopefully next time things might be more sanitary. Definitely, I'd recommend everybody giving this place a try, though--a different experience, for sure!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,AMAZING! First time here. We were in town for the weekend and stumbled upon this small gem and we love it. There were many options and even had vegan options as well. The staff was friendly and food was oh so good. The portion was a lot. We had enough for left overs. Will definitely be stopping back by here when in town.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Buddha Bowls Amazing place to eat Fresh  food, healthy,and also taste delicious really Recommended"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,The food is yummy. They gave out these awesome coupons at the beginning of the quarter which I use all the time which makes the bowls under $5 and the owner is super nice every time I walk by. Love the concept
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I am updating this review because I have noticed the owners and employees take people's advice to heart. They have started wearing gloves when preparing food. I do not mind people's bare hands touching mine, but it is very important to wash your hands after handling money.

A few times here and there they will forget to give me my ""nug"", but they rarely charge me for it anyways so it's not a problem. Great food, and their sourdough bowls are delicious!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Man I wish we had this in the bay! The hangover bowl was extremely flavorful and definitely worth every bang for your buck. The bread bowl itself may seem a little too much maybe 1 is enough to share with 2 people. Overall great experience and would definitely come back anytime I visit Santa Barbara.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Wow, love this place!  My daughter and I both had the Mediterranean bowl.  We both loved it.  Next time I'm going to try the Tomato Basil bowl.  The staff is very friendly."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"It was really tasty and the staff was friendly.  Really, no complaints.  If there were one of these near me I would be a repeat customer."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Great food, amazing atmosphere, and awesome customer service! Buddha bowl is an interesting way to enjoy your favorite foods in a delicious bread bowl of your choosing. The mellow bowl or the Mac daddy should be first on the ""to try list!"" 
The interior is very contemporary and has an appealing, modern feel to it. Lastly, the staff is great! Daniel is a great guy who loves what he does and enjoys finding new things to make the restaurant even better. Personally, the new surfboard (with menu displayed) was a fantastic idea incorporating  Santa Barbara's beach scene. If you haven't tried Buddha Bowls, this is a MUST try if you live in Isla Vista."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Great food, great owner. The snapwich price has gone up in the past years but it's still their feature item."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Seriously the best meal I've had in a long time came from here. Mac Daddy without the bacon. Limited seating but quick service and excellent food. They even give you a free drink if you're a student!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,The bowls are so good! It's worth the money and sometimes i can't even finish it because it's a good amount. Getting two munchies is such a good meal. Amazing customer service here as well.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I found this place on the way home from a swim meet in San Luis Obispo when my dad was screaming I WANT CLAM CHOWDER. I looked everywhere I until I came across this amazing place in Santa Barbara. May I just say that this is the most creative delicious place on earth. I got that Mac and cheese bowl with a side of clam chowder. Everything was made fresh and delicious. My dad got three different soup bowls and ate all of them. I wish I could go back, but it's kind of too far. The price is pretty cheap too. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the area, it's a must try."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"it was great !!! I had a pizza bowl and wife had the macaroni, we both found it to be very delicious, and will be back soon."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,This place has some good sourdough bowls filled with your choice of fillings. I got Mediterranean style bowl with chicken. The kids working there are friendly and attentive. Good experience..
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This place is great! I got a pizza bowl and cheesy bread and they were both so yummy. they make everything fresh right in front of you and have good portion sizes. It's exactly what you would expect and especially great if you love bread like i do, LOL! i'll definitely come back here again because i really want to try all the different options they offer."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I find it odd how much they promote marijuana in their theme but regardless, the bowls are unique and very very tasty."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I've always been a big fan of bread bowls ever since I've made several trips up North between Pismo Beach's clam chowder & San Francisco's Boudin's bakery's clam chowder. But this place... not only serves clam chowder in a bread bowl, but all of the above! This is another ""build your own"" bread bowl type of eatery.

How to: Simply follow the steps on the menu or you have the option of choosing a soup bowl or one of their staff favorites.

My bowl of choice: Whole wheat bread bowl, Mac Daddy with chicken added! I opted for one of their top picks & staff favorites. I didn't have much for breakfast so I was in need for some serious carbs. I was debating between the Pizza bowl, but I think I'll try that next time.

Verdict: Why are ALL the cheese just on top of the mac?! The chicken was well mixed inside, but there was less cheese than expected. The bacon was all on top as well, but good enough amount to mix the whole thing. The whole wheat bread bowl was perfectly toasted. Pretty much a sandwich with mac n cheese but in a bread bowl form. Add more cheese please! 

Ambience: Casual! I felt overly dressed coming in here because everyone was commuting through the city since the school is literally nearby. I was in work attire so I definitely looked straight out of the business. Good chill spot to grab a bowl & sit out with a good group of friends. The service I received were super chill vibes from the guys up front doing their job as needed.

Public Parking: Timed $, across the street, intersection of Pardall & Embarcadero del Mar. It's Isla Vista, the road is filled with nothing but students biking, skating, & walking all over the streets. Might as well save gas & roll your way in."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Okay so I came here for the first time with my boyfriend last week not knowing what to expect, my first impression was that it immediately felt like such a chill spot, the two employees were very friendly and they had grizzly bear playing so instantly I had good expectations. In terms of the food, OH MY GOD THE PORTIONS ARE MASSIVE!!!! I ordered the mellow bowl which first of all, looked like a beautiful work of fruit art and it even taste as good as it looked. My bf ordered the peace bowl with a side of Buddha sticks, the peace bowl was pretty good, I'm usually not a fan of hummus but when I tried the peace bowl I wasn't complaining. The whole bowl itself was so flavorful, especially with the tahini sauce that goes on top. The Buddha sticks were so bomb!!!! They were perfectly cheesy and the side of marinara sauce went very well with them. And like I said before, the portion size is pretty big so for $7 a bowl it's not a bad price at all. I would definitely encourage everyone to go check this place out if you haven't already, it's definitely going to be a popular spot."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,Got macaroni and cheese in a bowl and I only enjoyed the bread we got sour dough bread so it was ok but the macaroni tasted really bad and lacked flavor .. Won't be back next time I'm in isla vista
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Their bruschetta and mac and cheese are a heavenly combo. It's a bit expensive, but so worth it to get my bruschetta and/or mac and cheese craving here. Sometimes they have $4.20 deals, which makes it even better."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"It's alright. Not my fav place in IV but if I do go here, Macdaddy is my go to!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This is one of my favorite anytime eats in Isla Vista. The Mac Daddy is a crowd favorite for a reason. Every bowl is customizable and enough food to last 3 meals, which makes the price totally worth. Three words I'd use to describe Buddha Bowls are cheap, friendly, and delicious."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Buddha Bowls is a god send. I live down the street so I end up going here all the time, and I can absolutely say that Buddha Bowls is the perfect deviant from ""regular"" IV food. Really, how many burritos, tacos, and slices of pizza can you eat before the food slowly starts to transform into amorphous clouds of bland, generic paste you simply keep eating purely to get full. Buddha Bowls, centered around a bread motif, has copious options for hunger satisfaction and taste bud parties; the food-gasm can only be compared to that of entering outer space + psychedelics. Thank you Buddha Bowls. Thank you."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,Overrated. Mediocre food (mostly just bread) and some of the employees look annoyed to be there.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Buddha bowls is my favorite place to eat, sober and not. Their Mac Daddy makes me day so much better than it otherwise would be. Their service is impeccable, all the workers are so nice. I also love that they give free stickers."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,This place is dope. Staff is always nice and friendly. Food is good. I like having the cheaper option of snapwhichs too. Toppings are good. Love the hummus saucr. Very uniqie business never been anywhere like it. Highly reccomend.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,"I've eaten here several times now and it's not worth it in my opinion. Do you like small portions and lots of bread? If so, this might be fine for you but if I order a clam chowder bread bowl, I'd like more than a cup of soup. Also, the chicken is dry here."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"To start off with ill note that I made a yelp account simply because of my satisfaction with this restaurant and the need to praise it. 
This establishment didn't  hAve a legitimate  review so I felt the need to write a proper one. 

--scroll down to skip prelude--

It was approaching 8:30 in our car with my self and three friends of mine in fast pursuit of a delicious pho restaurant we had all planned to eat at. Our long day had been void of any satisfying food due to road trip diet.. Our gps eventually beeped alerting us of our ever closing proximity to the noodle hut. We arrived  only to roll by and see the restaurant was blacked out. (Way before it's closing time!!)
We were in utter shock my sister Ariana who had suggested the grand idea of pho Was aghast. 
However, aware of our situation we all flipped out our iPhones to search for food in the area. I google searched yelp and looked up restaurants near me, scanning through the menus of restaurant I came upon Buddha bowls, seeing it as the best choice we headed there. 


Food: (9.5) the restaurants food is basically revolved around delicious combinations of ingredients into some mind of edible bowl (wheat, sourdough. Melon!!!) Mix and max a large variety of sauces  two meats, (fruit!), vegetables and cheese.  All of this combined with handmade the sent through an oven. Goodies like fried egg and bacon can be added!!!
I got a barbecue pizza bowl with pineapple peppers and bacon! Delicious 
Tip: get the fried egg..seriously 
Want desert? Cinnamon bread ! Fruit bowl looked awesome
 - sounded similar to an acai bowl - 'dank'

Pricing (9) it's possible to make quite an affordable bowl and specials are available during certain times! combos for reduced pricing! Awesome! 
If your trying to make a large meal and add most of the extra commodities  it would come out to around 8.75-9.20. Which considering the area and the simple fact that a good meal tends to be pretty expensive makes it quite alright.

Decor (8.5) quite comfortable and friendly. There's a couch located in back right,
Art lines the wall. Unfortunately due to the areas similar 'hip' decor style that has popped up in such mass made making the appeal to such art much limited. The building is a bit small as well!

Service (9.5) awesome! the owner of the business works at the front and is an awesome cook who was quite friendly and welcoming making the place have a really great vibe. He can help you build your bowl if you want! Self proclaimed bowl expert!

Overall: (9.25) 
Delicious food with awesome service leaves little to discuss! However small building size refrains the place a bit.
Hope to see the business grow and possibly expand to my home town one day.

Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Best food in IV! The atmosphere is always great and the staff is always friendly. I'd recommend sharing a bowl with a friend or else expect to have left overs.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Great food great service. Can't go wrong with this place. The only thing, being a college student, it is a little pricey but what isn't pricey in IV nowadays. The owner is super friendly too!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"The only thing I've had from here is the new england clam chowder, but let me tell you how excited I am to be able to get a decent fix just a couple of blocks away..

I'm pretty excited.

On a cold day or maybe just when you have those cravings, you can order something that comes with some very creamy chowder and a very dank (bread) bowl. I don't know what else to tell you except get this if you don't wanna travel to the ends of the earth and back for some better clam chowder elsewhere. Also highly recommend everything on the menu in a sourdough bowl! It makes everything better.

***delivery option is a mad plus and super clutch for finals week and lazy days***"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Buddha Bowl is something special, there is nothing like it in IV and possibly nothing like it in Santa Barbara. The food is all served in an edible bowl, bread or fruit. You have the option of it served in a paper bowl or a lettuce bowl (Paper Bowl stuff with lettuce). 

There are set bowls on their menu like the Hangover Bowl, Mac Daddy, Mellow Bowl etc.  You can also make your own bowl which has a similar process as making your own burrito at Chipotle or Sandwich at Subway. There are a variety of vegetables, meats, cheeses, etc that you can add to this bowl and then it is baked and served.

The ingredients here are very fresh, the owner is a nice guy and gives excellent service along with his staff. The portions are pretty big and is always very filling whether you eat  the bread bowl or not.

There is a dessert option called the Mellow bowl that is served when in season. It's delicious and comes with a variety of fruits such as cantaloupe, strawberry, banana, and blue berry. Served with honey and granola it is delicious and refreshing.

If you are visiting IV, try this place out for something different than usual."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,These bread bowls are amazing.  It a good thing I live far away or else I'd be in trouble.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,I've been here twice and it's so good. It's new and the owner seems really passionate about making this restaurant a great place. I'd recommend the shroom bowl!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This place is pretty solid. 

This is one of the only places in IV that I frequent often. Their clam chowder is super rich and creamy. They toast the bread bowl with butter and it's just absolutely tasty. However, I find myself way too full after and I usually feel a little nauseous. Their portions are generous. I also get the Mediterranean bowl with chicken (which is extra) and the basil drizzle on top is my favorite part! Their mac and cheese is okay. However, I love their breadsticks. If I'm hungry but I don't want to spend too much money, I get two orders of breadsticks with marinara sauce (2 orders for $5). It is SUPER filling and I usually can't finish them all.

The workers are pleasant and very nice. There is limited seating and the place can fill up really quickly really fast. If you're a student, you can usually find coupons for this place (BOGO or $4.20 deal). The portions are awesome and this place will leave you fulfilled for the price!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This is my favorite spot to eat in IV. The owner and the employees there are super chill, I find myself hanging around after getting my food just talking about music or life. The food is super dank and the bread bowl is so filling its a perfect pre pregame meal, lowers blackout rate by 37.2%. SCIENCE! Serioisly tho if you're stoned or drunk this place is always a good call."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"My friend and I came in for the first time and asked one of the workers what was good and how it works. He was super helpful, telling us his fav bowls and also how to make a bowl custom. I ended up getting the Mac Daddy and my friend got the Mediterranean bowl. The Mac Daddy was soooo good, but make sure you're super hungry! The Mediterranean bowl was delicious, actually my fav! Eating the bread bowl at the end with hummus all over was the best part :) we'll be back!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,This place was a first for me and I definitely will be back! I had the mac and cheese bowl and added lots of veggies. So delicious!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Great service and great bowls. At first I thought it didn't look flavorful but I was surprised even my the garlic butter lid alone. The Mac and cheese bowl was good I got it was sausage it had the perfect hint of rosemary that I love it was perfect. Can't wait to try more bowls !. Garlic top was very salty so order a bowl that'll counter act the salt.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"So freaking good. Such a great idea! The tomato basil couldn't have been better, and the mac daddy didn't disappoint one bit.  Anytime I'm in the area, I'll be stopping here and telling others about it."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Love there munchies, especially there Nutella snap! There Mac daddy is on point, go there lit and you will have the meal of your life."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Pretty good.

I got the mac and cheese bowl and it didn't live up to my expectations, the mac and cheese had no flavor or salt. Overall good idea for a restaurant and employees were nice!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"To be fair, this is probably more of a 3 star, but the food is pretty unique and makes great comfort/stoner food. It's affordable, different, and delicious, plus they give you lots of options for your bowl. Don't leave without trying the nutella snap."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"This is my favorite food place to eat in IV ever. It's the only one of its kind and is sustainable, unlike many other IV options. Get the pesto base- nothing quite like it. Also be sure to ask to have the insides of your bowl brushed with garlic before putting it through the oven. 

Tldr: Buddha bowls are fire, get pesto."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,I highly recommend the pizza bowl because they have the BEST red sauce I have ever had here. (Better than the Italian place next door.) The melon bowl is equally delicious! This is probably the only place in Isla Vista where they play good music and have soup that doesn't come out of a package (yeah I'm talking to you silvergreens!)
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,Got the Mac Daddy for $4.20 and it was really tasty. Love a good bread bowl!
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Buddha Bowls is a great environment with great food. All the ingredients are fresh and you can really create any bowl you would like.
The Buddha sticks are the best breadsticks you will find in IV by far and the Volcano is a creative/tasty dessert.

Overall it is a great place that all Isla Vistans should give a try!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"The Mac Daddy OMG I can die happy now! 

That is one of my favorite bowls but I always like trying new things at Buddha Bowls.  You can pretty much get as creative as you want! 

Food is good and so is the customer service. They are always super friendly and upbeat! 

Everyone should give this place a shot! Who knows I see this one day being the next big thing!!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,negative,I am not really sure if i like this place. The food was really heavy/unhealthy. I got Mac and cheese to be safe and it had WAY too much pepper in it. I cant believe it. There is definitely no healthy food there. Good place to go to when you are hungry.
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I ordered the tomato soup bowl and the sweet passion tea. The tea was amaaaazing. It was just the perfect amount of sweet. I came back the next day just to get more. 

The tomato soup was good. Its a nice touch that they add cheese to the bread top and a little on the inside of the bowl. I like some other places they also give you the inside part of the bread that they scoop out. They turn it into garlic bread. So all in all a pretty filling meal

The only downside was I asked the guy if he could add mushrooms and he said yelp. And I realized as I ate the food that he had forgotten to toss those in. Whoops. The bread was a little over toasted but it was alright. The guy was pretty friendly and all the workers seemed pretty nice too."
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I highly recommend the Mac Daddy + Chicken (extra $1.20, but so worth it!!!!) It's creamy and delicious, but the one down-side is that there's too much bread afterwards; you might want to pair this with a side of marinara for after you finish the Mac. 

I also had the Hawaiian bowl without the bell peppers and olives. Next time, I would get it without the red onions, because I think it over powers the whole bowl. 

Try the Nutella Snap if you want something sweet!!! The strawberries were very fresh and sweet, and it was super yummy and filling. :) 

Check this place out!!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"I love coming here! Although I try to restrain how often I come here because you get a lot of food in one bowl! I usually just get the Mac Daddy with pesto inside and sausage added to it along with everything else or their clam chowder in a sourdough bowl. They really fill your bowl to the brim and it is always perfectly toasted. I have never been disappointed by the food here. It is so good and perfect for anytime of the day (literally ANY TIME). After coming here once, you will definitely keep coming back!"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Stop reading this Yelp post right now and go pack yourself a bowl at Buddha Bowls. This place is FIRE! Get the pizza bowl or the BBQ bowl in the sourdough bread bowl and get the combo with either buddha bread sticks or the ""volcano"" which is a delicious mess of sour dough bread covered in freshly cut strawberries, whip cream and chocolate. Their bread sticks are super delicious in combination with their marinara sauce they give with it. Overall super delicious and super filling! I usually share a bowl 'cuz bowls are better that way:) and because the bread bowls are huge lol"
Gg2ZHe57Ztuv8JaFj0mNhw,Dank Bowl Kitchen,American,positive,"Super trendy little place. The staff was very friendly and the wait was short. The food was savory and a little overpriced but good. Very large bread bowls and portions! One bread bowl could definitely serve two people who want to share. Overall, I would recommend."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"I want to give them 10  stars if I could!! We stopped there to eat after a long drive of 10 hours, we never thought that, that tiny little place will make us sad to leave! The food is awesome!! And the place, it's so intimate and warm and cozy!! We liked it so much that in our way back home, we change our route just to pass and eat again there!!!"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"The Turkey Meatloaf sandwich is freaking awesome! It is flavorful with herbs, vinaigrette and cheese. It is moist and fresh. I also tasted the classic avocado sandwich and it is so fresh and bursting with flavor. Really great sandwiches. I am definitely going to go back for more. I would like to sit in their garden in the summer for a lunch."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Brioche French toast was better than at the Beachcomber in Newport Beach, which is saying a lot!  Clearly they're able to make fantastic food here. I was a little disappointed with the garden omelette & potatoes. It was bland, as if made without seasoning."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"great little roadside cafe.  the oatmeal was very good as was the coffee, but the best part is the garden terrace to sit relax and enjoy."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Posole Verde is my main reason for coming here- fresh, with avocado and shredded cabbage garnish. It hits the spot, if you are a lover of green chile. 
Coffee is above average. Don't get the bagels. Along with some of the other reviews, I agree it's a bit pricey here- but 
The atmosphere is pleasing."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,This is a regular road trip stop for us. You know a place is good when your picky eater kids remember and ask to stop for lunch. I always live the quiche.
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"I love coming here for breakfast on Sunday mornings. The patio is so peaceful and relaxing.  Vanilla lattes are delicious, sandwiches tasty and fresh.  I also really enjoy the birds around the patio, they're fairly tame and add to the beauty of the patio"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,Very nice Lunch on the way to.Santa Barbara the food was really.good and the service was nice. The grounds on this place was like being in a secret garden. Was so nice I would stop on the way up north.
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Very nice place to relax, food was fresh and service was kind and helpful. Their seating area outside was soo relaxing. As soon as you walk out to the patio you smell all the flowers they have. Seating under shade with a good atmosphere. Definitely will go back."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"On our drive back home, stopped by The Garden Market for a light lunch. Hubby and I split a basic garden salad and turkey sandwich. The salad was romaine lettuce, cranberries, cucumber, avocado, and slivered almonds. The sandwich was served on ciabatta bread, thick turkey deli meat, two slices of provolone cheese, red onions, and red peppers. The service was friendly and prompt. The best part was the garden setting behind the restaurant. It was okay, but not a place I would stop by again."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Delicious food! Two favorites re sandwiches  avocado and meatloaf! Delicious salads and 
yummy blueberry muffins. Such a peaceful place to escape the crazy world we live in.
Garden setting outside. Wish they were open for dinner. If you are on your way back to LA
and got in the terrible sunday traffic this is a great short stop off the 101."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"What a gorgeous place to eat!!

Very romantic and intimate, love the garden in the back. I love how all the decor is gorgeous but you can also buy it! The food was fantastic! Came here with SB Axxess deal and received BOGO on sandwiches. I recommend the premium turkey. AMAZING! Prices were great and service was excellent! They also have a great local wine selection so I have purchased a few unique and low priced bottles! Love this place! Great for lunch!!"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"This place is very friendly, service is fast and accurate and the food is pretty darn good. 

Even if you're just in a hurry and want to get something like the deviled eggs or the pasta with brie and olives with sundried tomatoes in the fridge, you can have an instant picnic going without compromising on the quality of food.

In terms of ordering here, I've tried most of the salads and they are great. I'm not a sandwich eater, but my friends who have eaten here with me have said they liked the sandwiches. My favorite is the daily quiche which is made fresh. Nothing like fresh quiche on a weekend morning to make a lady happy. :)

(PS The photo of them ""selling"" Santa Barbara magazine is unfair. The poster has that magazine confused with SB Edible or some of the other free magazines everyone gives away. SB Magazine has never been free, nobody gives it away. I just wanted to get that off my chest, it seemed unfair!)"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"my name is thomas and my wife naomi we always stop here from orange county when we're enroute to morro bay and this place though not fancy the food is incredible and we found it by accident when we needed to use a restroom and we found this place on our last trip in summer of 2014, and we decided to have lunch and the staff is of the most friendly i've seen in most restaurants and i very highly recommend this establishment to travelers in that area, to us this place is and easy 10! really nice patio setting, if your in area go here for sure you will love it!"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"What a nice surprise.  We were starving after surfing and craving some breakfast.  We were thinking about heading into Santa Barbara but couldn't wait, so I pulled off at Santa Claus Lane after eyeing a sign for the BBQ joint next door.
It was too early for BBQ.  Drat.  Must try next time.
BUT...the Garden Market was open.  I looked at the blackboard and it looked awfully short, but they handed us the menu which lifted my hopes.  I went with a half soup/sandwich combo - BLT & egg salad (I can never pass up egg salad, especially when combined with a salted, smoked meat) and the pozole soup.  Silvio went for an omelette with spinach, feta, mushrooms and bacon.  Mmmmm bacon and feta!
I had a matte latte with soy milk.  Perfect little picker upper without the coffee crack out.
We meandered out to the patio area which was a beautiful sanctuary.  There were so many beautiful potted plants, birdbaths, a lovely fountain.  There was no one out there when we found our table.  There were a lot of birds that were hanging out, taking baths and just chilling.  I felt like a Chinese Snow White.
The pozole - i wish it was more brothy.  It was so loaded with cabbage, tomatoes, onions, and avocado that it was a little tough to eat, but the flavors were really good.  I was eating that up with the tortilla chips on my plate.
The sandwich was fantastic.  Their egg salad had just the right amount of dill.
It was wonderful to just sit there after we ate and enjoy the environment.
I have a feeling this is going to be one of our new surf stops."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"This place is very cute. Love the outdoor seating area. The food is just okay though. We ordered two sandwich dishes and there was mostly salad inside, very little meat or other ingredients. Came here for the axxess deal but probably wont be back."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Had the trip tip sandwich and it was delicious. The flavors are not too in your face and I appreciate that. We sat out back in the back patio. The sun was shining, birds chirping and bathing in the fountains .. can't really complain!

The chairs were stylish but not the most comfortable to spend a lunch in but I guess it's part of the image. Also, the place could use a soda fountain in my humble opinion. It DOES have two coolers with any kind of drink you may want (waters, sodas, beers, etc.)

Will be back to try more sandwiches! Apparently the meat loaf is really good too!"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"Dont waste your time with these people. The cashier had no clue what we were ordering, nor how to operate the register. We asked for simple drinks that were on the big ass menu over her head and she still had no clue. Nobody helped her when she got upset and flustered. Jesus."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"Our bike group has been here several times. The quality and service is very sporadic. If they make a mistake, i.e. sour milk in Latte, forgetting an order, etc., they won't own up to it. In fact, they are downright surly about it and refuse to right the wrong. They did it again today and have now permanently lost the business of our whole group and our families."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,Great for fresh food. I love it here because you sit in the back in their open garden. Perfect on a sunny day with some iced tea. love it! The Turkey sandwich is my fav!
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"I have loved this place since it first opened. The outside patio is beautifully landscaped and peaceful. The new inside seating area adjacent to the kitchen is so cozy! And the wine bar and great selection of reasonably priced wines make this market even better. The food is all so fresh and delicious!! If you like chicken salad, its a MUST TRY."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,Just stopped by. Had the meatloaf sandwhich. It was excellent! Even their ice tea is great. Sat in the back patio. Very cute and charming. Staff are nice.
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"So here's the thing, I stopped here for lunch despite some of the reviews because the menu sounded great. Just like the other reviews said the specials were almost totally gone and I was there at 11:30. The menu looked amazing and I got exactly the type of sandwich I was craving along with a Kale side salad and some tea. 
The lady who took my order seemed totally put out by ever single question I asked. I only asked a few it's not as bad as it sounds. I walked around the outside patio area which is charming an checked out their little goodies in the store as I waited for my meal. Once it was ready I took off to go eat at the beach in the sun to warm up from the very chilly woman's attitude.
Cheers & Happy Eating"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,For a place to eat breakfast on or from Santa Barbara....nice little country place.  Family feel and a beautiful outdoor place.  You order and they bring the food to you.  The food is actually quite good.  I love the laid back feel of the place and the family charm.  Plus you can say you were on Santa Claus lane!
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Pricey but good food.

We stopped here for some to-go sandwiches and headed to the beach. The sandwiches (tried tri-tip and chicken salad) were very tasty and flavorful. Would go back for sure, but for the portion size it is a little on the small side."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Hidden gem! We've come to Santa Claus Lane numerous times but never spotted the Garden Market. After looking online for a place to grab a healthy lunch on a Sunday, we stopped in for a salad. To our surprise, the food was fresh and tasty and the back garden was the perfect setting for a warm, sunny January afternoon."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"Today my sister and I decided to stop at Garden Market on the way home from Santa Barbara.
Pozole Verde...that's what we always have...but alas, it wasn't Friday, so decided to share a turkey sandwich.
My sister ordered.  When the order taker looked at me I told her we were going to share....and so didn't order anything.
Turkey sandwich was pretty good.  Served in two little metal baskets on a sheet of paper with about 5 chips and a pepper.
As we sat outside enjoying an incredible day after all the rain I happened to notice on the bill that we had been charged a $2 split charge. $2 on an $8.95 sandwich that they CUT IN HALF!!!!   WTF??????
After eating we stepped back inside and checked the board, paper menu and specials.  Hmmmm....nothing anywhere about a split charge.  So we asked.  Well duh, you would have thought we were idiots.  We explained.  The three girls behind the counter didn't want to hear it.  We were INFORMED that most restaurants do this as a matter of course.  Well....I DON""T THINK SO!  Just ate at Aloha Steakhouse in Ventura.  Split dinner.  They split the fish, the potato...they will even split the salad.  No split charge.  NONE!
But I digress.
Sister said....geeze, it wasn't like you had to wash a plate.
Nothing. Nada......
NOT even an I'm sorry.  What they should have said was ""We should have mentioned this to you when you ordered.  What can we do to make you happy?  Want your $2 back?""  But nope....just kept telling us that's what a nice restaurant would do. Bla, Bla, Bla.
Well...this isn't a NICE restaurant.  It is a soup/salad/sandwich shop that serves their sandwiches on paper in a basket.  
Guess we get our Pozole Verde somewhere that doesn't charge a SPLIT charge....lol, wonder how they'd do that with soup?  OMG...do you think they'd charge us for the extra spoon?"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"I'm from Santa Barbara, and this place has been a secret local spot for years. The garden patio in the back is the best place to spend a relaxing lunch. I bring everyone here, because it is always such a easy pleasing surprise. The food is simple yet fresh and tasty, there is always new wine to try and the fountains and succulents are inspiring. 

Tri-tip sandwich, egg salad BLT, all the soups or fresh market salads, and breakfast burrito with avocado are my favs...

It's a small operation and they can get pretty busy sometimes, so have some patience..."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"You have to stop by here, you just have to.
They have something for every one I promise. Everything is really cheap and tasty. Make sure you sit outside."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Oh how I miss my beach days in Santa Barbara! My girlfriends (all in my profile picture) and I would frequent the garden market on a sunny afternoon. We'd buy a couple bottles of wine, some sandwiches and salads, and enjoy the afternoon in the back garden of this little shop, gossiping at a table with the ocean waves in the background. Sounds too serene to be true? You will just have to find out for yourself. I'm way overdue for an afternoon at this spot!"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"I enjoy The Garden Market because of the back patio. The service, food, and drinks are all mediocre though. If you want a decent coffee drink go elsewhere. If you want the opportunity to browse an incredible amount of tchotchkes while waiting far too long for a latte, this is the place for you!"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"The Garden Market is an absolutely wonderful place to host an event.
I had a wedding rehearsal brunch there and I could not be happier.  The owners were happy to speak with me (I called many times!) and go over all of the details that I wanted to include.  That said, I felt very confidant and comfortable turning the planning of the brunch over to them, knowing that it would turn out nice.  And it did!  In fact it was exquisite!  
It was a sunny day so they set up patio umbrellas in their beautiful garden in the back.  The tables were simple and beautiful, the service was attentive but unobtrusive and the food, the food!  It was delicious.
My favorites were the Lorie salad, the gruyere and pancetta quiche, and the egg salad.  but there was much more.  We spent the afternoon lounging in the garden, leisurely eating, listening to speeches, and even watching a montage video.  The back area is like a little zen oasis.
We had many people come from the east coast and it was a perfect place to bring them.  Simple, elegant, personal and very Carpinteria.  
I would highly recommend the Garden Market to anyone thinking of hosting a party in the area.  The owners work with you to make sure you will get exactly what you want and then outdo your expectations.  
We love the garden Market!"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"What a hidden gem off the 101!  I am surprised that I am the first to review about this place because usually these mom and pops eateries are favorites.

Garden Market has super fresh food and I know I am never eating day old stuff (well maybe the pastries).  Their food is a little over priced but I am sure that is not a problem with the clientele they serve.  I know I have seen Rob Lowe there (I think he owns a house on the beach property that is walking distance)...but anyways, their standard sandwich is give or take 9 bucks, which comes with chips.  My aunt raves over the chips, how it is the best, but I am pretty sure they are just Doritos haha.  I have gotten their Avocado sanwich, pretty much a vegetarian sandwich and it sooo good.  My aunt got the chicken salad sandwich and that was delish.  Their chicken sald mix has cucumbers, nuts, chicken breast, and the chicken ain't dry at all.  We also got one of their deli dishes, some shrimp/cucumber mix with cilantro in oil, soo good, but i think a small bowl of that was like $8!!!?!?!

The environment is super cute, it's like your eating in a secret garden/green house.  When I looked around for a place to sit, I saw birds walking around.  They had cute knick knack (but overpriced) things for sale.  They have a lot of area, indoors and out.  I wouldn't say this is the best place for a date, but maybe a place to take your grandma? family members?

Overall, a lunch for two people cost $35...wow a lot, but the food is good, service is friendly and a cute area with a ocean view."

cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,Beautiful spot but distracted service.  An expensive sandwich was not as good as I had hoped.
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"The food is delicious.....if they can get your order right...which eventually they do after the 2nd or 3rd try. I mostly come here for the ambiance and a glass of wine. I read, do a crossword, or just sit and think. The outside patio is great. I usually hate birds, but I don't mind the ones that find their way into this garden oasis. It is a very tranquil and peaceful spot to while the way the afternoon. Not the best place for picky eaters (like me) ...but if you like things ""as is""...don't pass this place up. Its gorgeous."

Frequent it often but am always somewhat frustrated with the amount of time it takes to order and receive food.  Good not great sandwiches and salads.   They do have a nice gift shop that is always entertaining while I wait but don't know if I would go out of my way to frequent if I weren't in the area."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,"Such a great place in Carp! Stopped by for the first time and ordered Lori's Salad and the California Ciabatta and they were delicious! Lori's salad was light but filling and the balsamic vinaigrette was amazing. The California Ciabatta had delicious applewood bacon and everything in the sandwich meshed perfectly. Overall the food was VERY healthy and although your stomach was full it doesn't leave you feeling bloated. 

If you're coming for the first time, definitely dine in and sit outside in the garden! It is such a nice place to relax and really beautiful. Plants and little trinkets everywhere, a great place for some lunch when the sun is shining and majority of the time is is! Would definitely recommend to anyone dropping by Carpenteria looking for a nice lunch spot.

Today three of us were up in Summerland at the nurseries and decided to stop in  for lunch.  We were pleasantly surprised they had enlarged their restaurant.  Normally we would sit outside but it was a little cold and opted to sit inside the newly remodeled section.  My sister had a great crab salad, cousin had a turkey sandwich with yummy corn chips and I had the Israeli Couscous salad.  It was loaded with dried apricots, pecans, oranges, shredded carrots, basil in a lemony dressing.  

I feel their prices are pretty reasonable (my cup of couscous was only $4.25)  and everything is so frest and delicious.  

Am looking forward to trying their breakfast items as they open at 7:00 a.m. each day.  

I brought extra salad to take home for my hubby!"
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"We've stopped here twice on road trips. The food and ambiance have been enjoyable both times, however don't buy a coffee here. It takes about 30+ minutes to get your coffee, and my wife's coffee tasted like cigar ash. We waited so long to get our coffee, and were already on the road by the time we noticed it. I'm not sure if we pissed someone off, and they actually put a used cigar in her drink, or what, but this same thing happened to us on our first trip here nearly a year ago. Very bizarre. She ordered a vanilla latte both times, which we ended up throwing out, both times. It was totally disgusting."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,negative,"What horrible customer service. No one greeted us, no ""Thank You"" and rude to top it off.  We were the only ones in the market and asked  how much a bamboo ladder cost outside the store and the  women snapped at me saying ""it's NOT for sale"" I said that is strange because it looks like there is a
Price tag on it. She shouted the owner would
Never sell that! I looked closer and in fact the price tag was on it and it said ""bamboo ladder and the price .  She ran over to the ladder saw the price and obviously felt like an idiot.  She didn't apologize.  I took my coffees and left.  The 2 deserts were delicious but I would never go back. None of
The employees had any basic customer service or people skills and were in fact down right rude.  I like
To support small business as I have a store as well.  My employees would be gone if
They acted that way.

There is a lovely outdoor patio with plenty of tables and places to sit in the shade. The atmosphere is a wonderfully tranquil garden with lovely plants and flowers and the cool ocean breeze is refreshing, you can hear the ocean and birds chirping. 

The food is fresh and colorful made with wholesome natural locally sourced ingredients. You order at the counter and they bring your food and drink to the table. The huevos rancheros is excellent. I was skeptical about ordering huevos rancheros at a beach front café.
Thank you for a wonderful breakfast as always..."
cOoTIQ0RcudE1R5aRVZzdw,The Garden Market,American,positive,Excellent Tri-tip sandwich & Caesar Salad.  Nice garden out back to enjoy the nice weather.
