VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,The burgers are amazing! French fries are decent (so get the onion rings).
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"This was our first time trying Cal Taco, as we just moved to town and it's a 3 minute walk from our apartment. You probably wouldn't notice the place unless you were looking for it, but it's less of a dive inside than you would think, i.e. chain-fast-food-restaurant-style chairs and tables that are anchored to the ground and commercial signs designating the soda and salsa bars.

We ordered two tacos each, with the beans/rice/drink combo as well. We probably should have split one of the combo plates as the walk home was a bit more of a waddle. The fish tacos were decent, but I've had better.

The fish itself didn't have much flavor so most of the taco's taste came from the toppings. I'd try a burrito next time. The beans and rice were fine, but the cheese shreddings on top seemed unmeltable! Throughout the whole meal they maintained their waxy shredded-cheese shape. Ah well!

Overall I thought it was fine, but a littleeee too pricey for the quality."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Best Onion Rings in Santa Barbara/Goleta!!! Rare combination of friendly service, good burgers and reasonably priced (Charburger for $1.99 on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday)  The service and friendly staff always have me coming back!!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"they started serving breakfast, and its a good deal: two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, and hashbrowns for about five bucks. not bad. the food isnt the greatest, but its reasonably priced--especially the breakfast. the burgers are mediocre and the mexican food isnt too great, but its a dependable place."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This place has been around for years and it's still the best local burger/taco place in town. The fajitas are to die for.  Ultra-friendly staff and a fun, atmosphere.  Guy Fieri from DDD should visit here!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"I'm torn with this place. It used to be a lot better, but I read (here on Yelp) that it has recently changed ownership and that might be why my last few experiences haven't been up to the same standard as previous visits. 

First, I feel like the best thing you can get here is the crispy tacos. They have always done a good job with these (go figure, their name has taco in it.) The burgers are just okay (go figure, they're not a burger restaurant.) 

The one thing they get right in my book, consistently, is accuracy and friendliness. I've never had a mixed up order here and they never forget small details. That's a rare thing in my book. 

I'm not sure this is the best place in Goleta to eat a taco, but it's decent and if you order what they're good at making, you'll likely get a tasty meal served friendly."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"For being called Cal Taco, this place has some good quality burgers. Don't be fooled by their name because this is a good burger joint as well (not sure about their Mexican food).The burgers are a bit smaller than you'd expect but it's still a filling meal. I would definitely be going back!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Stopped in to Cal Taco after many years of not being there. Why did I stop
the Food is Great !  Both American and Mexican on the Menus. Burgers
are solid as well as the tacos. They have breakfast too ! Place was
half full,  nice staff and Yum Chocolate Malts !! with Real Malt !!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Good food reasonably priced. On our way home from Lompoc (watched SpaceX launch) to Los Angeles and found this gem thru the Yelp app.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I LOVE THEIR CHARBURGERS and ONION RINGS and ZUCCHINI STICKS! I go at least two Sundays a month for the 1.89 charburger deal. I get two burgers and some onion rings, it usually costs about six bucks, WHAT A DEAL! The owner is awesome and friendly, as are the gals that work the register and the cooks in the back. They have never gotten my order wrong and their ranch dressing is to die for."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,Not friendly at all. Girl forgot to give me my cup so I asked for a cup. She asked me questions like I took a cup. Is she for real? Bad customer service. Has gone downhill since new ownership.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Good food, they didn't rush us when we were eating last closing. The fish tacos were BOMB!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I wish I could give this place six stars! It's fast and friendly. Great prices for great food! I've had the fish tacos, the chicken tacos, the steak tacos. All good! My review is short because there's nothing bad to say about this place! If you're in the area stop in! It'll make for a good quick tasty lunch."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,No more cig butts. Good after surf burgers and tacos. Thanks for listening to the reviews!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Cal Taco is great for veggie burgers. I heard that the owner is brothers with the owner of the Habit and you can tell the similarities. The veggie pattie is the same but Cal Taco does their pattie more ""char grilled"" (which is delicious) and the bun, toppings, etc. are different. The fries are very similar if not identical to the Habit's. The size of the meal is huge and it definitely fills you up. 

This location is really convenient if you live in Goleta. They have indoor and outdoor seating and you can call in your take-out order. Cal Taco is a great local spot for burgers or Mexican food."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Yuck yuck and double yuck. This place has new ownership. Not friendly. Prices are higher than The Habit but food is much lower quality. Charburger was overly ""charred"" and had a burnt taste. They are definitely using dirty oil to cook their fries- they are darker brown and you can taste the grease on them. Having worked in fast food and restaurants, that is a big no-no. Clean oil produces very light golden fries- no oil taste. Do not eat here - prices are no bargain and food is not good. Hoping I don't get sick. Yuck."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"They're food is good for the price. Don't come here expecting anything fancy, though. The breakfast burritos are delicious. Definitely not authentic Mexican food."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I was born & raised in Goleta, & this is my favorite place to get a burger! The staff is always friendly, & the food is always AMAZING!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"1. Service is incredibly friendly
2. Menu is actually vegitarian and carb free friendly
3. Um, and the most important, my fish tacos were ridiculously good. They used their house salsa to marinate the fish. It had such great flavor I regret not getting a 3rd taco. Oh and don't worry about your tortillas getting soggy. I ate my tacos in lighting speed they were so good ;)"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This place never disappoints!
I have had their regular burritos before, it was great size with good price. Finally had their breakfast burrito with chorizo, even better! Only $6.50 and it was huge! One of the highest price-quality ratio places in SB!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Update: changed ownership recently. Didn't know that when I wrote the review below. 

We're regular patrons as we live nearby. We go there at least twice a month, often more frequently. When the owner is there, we find the food tasty and fresh. When he's not there... hmmm.

The other night may have been one of those nights. I had a lot of trouble placing my order over the cell phone (for pick up): a double char combo, single char combo, plus kid's meal bean/cheese burrito combo. No problem with the first two items, but we wanted to substitute the Mexican rice for the fries on the kid's meal. We do this all the time. Communicating that change to the order-taker was challenging, but we finally seemed to get on the same page after agreeing to pay an extra 50 cents for the substitution. I don't know whether we've paid that surcharge in the past, but whatever -- the kid wants rice.

It was a busy in the restaurant but we finally got the food into the car to take home. We found no side of Mexican rice in the order even though we paid the extra .50. Glad we checked before driving off. Had to go back in to the restaurant to get the rice, which took another 10+ minutes, during which time numerous patrons were coming to the front to ask where their missing food items were. By the time we got home, things were lukewarm at best. But the rice, we discovered, had been put into the burrito. If you know kids, you know that SEPARATE foods are important to them, so this wasn't appreciated by my son, but he made a comment and ate half of it anyway. Okay, miscommunication can happen, not a big deal.

But what's not acceptable? The double burger was tasty and fresh as normal. The single burger was on a stale crusty bun, the meat patty dry, overcooked, and had only the slightest trace of the cheese that I'd requested, and had no lettuce and tomato. It was so disappointing, and in stark contrast to the double burger's goodness. Do they pre-make some of these single burgers and let them sit around a while??? Because that sure is what it seemed to be -- a premade, dry, stale single burger. 

Please, Cal Taco -- I recommend your restaurant to friends regularly, but I'm going to have to stop if you are premaking burgers. Yuck!!!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Great value if you want tacos. 

This is like a taco truck, but in a fixed location.  

I prefer to have a side salad and guacamole rather than loading up on protein."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Went on a whim for a burrito, will take the time to go here over any other quick stop in town."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,This place is pretty good for breakfast burritos. I was annoyed that when I was getting salsa from the bar to take home. The guy said I would have to pay extra for more than 3 of those small cups to put salsa in. I was annoyed by that cause the burrito is huge and it comes with tortilla chips. 3 small little cups isn't enough in my opinion
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Things were a little rough during the change of ownership so we haven't been here in a while.  We were hungry after dropping off some recycling so I had a choice when hitting Hollister.  Turn left and go to the Habit or turn right and stop at Cal Taco.  Well, I took the direction towards home and we ate at Cal Taco.

Walking in the first thing we noticed was how much brighter it was.  The backlit menu added a lot of light to the place.  Nice and clean.  I had transitioned from amerimex to burgers when they had the 1.99 sunday burgers but today I went back to the amerimex menu.  I had a steak taco and a chicken taco.  My wife had a pair of fish taco's.  My son had the double cheesburger with bacon he usually has plus an order of fries.

Wandering over to the salsa bar I noticed they eliminated the fire roasted salsa.  That is a shame since I really liked it.   My wife went for the regular red salsa and I had the salsa verde.  The food was ready shortly and the first thing I noticed is the portions had increases along with the prices.  The taco's were huge.  The steak tack was dissapointing with the steak being dry and overcooked.  The chick tack was sliced, grilled chicken breast.  It too was a little dry but nothing a splash of salsa verde couldn't fix.  My wife said the fish taco's were fine and my son reported the burgers as ""about the same as before"" which was decent.

So, in summary, the new management has not changed things much.  You can still get a bargain if you go during happy hour monday-wednesday.  Otherwise, three of us ate for 25 dollars which isn't bad these days."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"California eh?  I thought the owner's name was Cal or something... The burritos are worth writing home about, they're worth singing a song about, they're worth painting your face over.

Never had anything besides a burrito here: no need to.  Who goes to a taqueria and orders a burger anyway?  

Auf.

PS: If you like Cal Taco, you'll like The Habit for burgers.  I think they may be related - or they bought their menu signs from the same vendor..."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Since I am native to the Ellwood area, I have been going to this place since high school and all I have to say is that I will fight you for a Cal Burrito when I come home!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Great customer service from Hugo. He was efficient, informative and made the experience personal, we weren't just a number. Food was great and establishment well kept up. Highly recommend and will be back."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Yes my Fav burger spot !! Great menu, I have tried most items and love the portion size."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"After living in Boston for a few years, I returned to Goleta to visit a friend with a craving for something they just don't do that well on the East Coast; a breakfast burrito. The staff happily accommodated our sleepy and disorganized group and even sold me coffee that I was pretty sure was for the employees. The burrito was delicious and came with a great number of options for add-ons up, none of which disappointed.  The only reason I settled on four stars instead of five was that I felt that the potatoes could have used a bit more spicing up.  So if any employees are reading this, a friendly suggestion, cook up those potatoes with some salt and chili powder, and I'll be there every morning I'm in Goleta."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Incredible chorizo breakfast burrito!  After a big night in I.V. With my daughter I yelped bfast burritos and found this gem.  After a quick call in order for 7 burritos (ready in 20 minutes) we were back on our feet again!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I wish there was another one closer to SB and not in deep goleta - no, the habit is not the same. Habit chars their burgers just a little too much. Cal taco is way better in my book. $3.50 for a charburger with cheese? Can't go wrong! In the 20 years I have been coming here it still has yet to disappoint."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This place is very underrated. It seems as if the locals only know about this place, but it has always been a favorite whether it meant grabbing lunch on the go or getting food after the beach. I spoke with the owner and this place has been around for about 24 years. I used to eat here when I was in high school and it's still nice to visit after college. The price is affordable so you can't go wrong by trying it."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Placed a take out order and this is what I got: 5 tacos made from boxed style taco shells (like the kind that Taco Bell uses), and containers only half full of the rice and beans that I ordered. The tacos were bland and because of the shell, were awful.  The rice was way over cooked and therefore hard and tasteless. The beans were good. I paid $18 for beans. The rest I threw in the trash.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE !!!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Just had to give Cal Taco a good review after going here for years. Just discovered breakfast here and it was delicious. The Cal Taco omelet is perfectly made and the ingredients taste so fresh. Their burgers are always great and the tacos hit the spot. I really should eat here more. If you haven't had it, do yourself a favor and give it a try. Don't miss out on breakfast though you have to wait till 8am (someday maybe they can open by 7:30am?)"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"If you like the Habit, you'll love Cal Taco. Their history goes back to the same time, and I believe the owners of the two were related, which is why you'll find the ""Char Burger"" here as well.

I no longer go to the Habit because of how much it's changed, but Cal Taco has stayed small, and still does it the old way."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Just had their 1.89 charburger sunday special. added cheese, avo, and jalepeno. very tasty. 
this may be our new neighborhood go-to place for when we want some good food fast and cheap. 
bf had the bbq chicken sandwich which was very good too.
I also got an order of zucchini stix - yum.  
cant wait to try the rest of the menu!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Love this little neighborhood place! The service is always quick and with a smile. I love the people who work here. I typically get Mexican food when I come here (which is quite a bit) but the burgers are also amazing. The ground beef is flavorful so I love adding it to a burrito, tostada, or monkey bowl. Also great beer prices."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"We went here two weeks ago, because we were trying to decide on trying someplace new, or going to chipotle. I ordered a cal burrito and received a massive chicken burrito. It was absolutely delicious. Everything was served hot, and it was filled with rice,  beans sauce. There wan't any guacamole or sour cream though. It  was still very delicious and I can't wait to try their breakfast burritos."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Gotta give this place props for the zuchini fries (best with ranch!), the quesadillas, and the burgers.  When I was still at UCSB and working in the area, this was definitely one of my favorite go-to places for lunch. :)

Staff is friendly, food comes out quick, and they've never said no to extra ranch/salsa!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"So cheap, so good, the portions are big and the staff is friendly. Great salsa!!! You can't miss."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I had lunch here for the first time. If I could, I'd give it  3.75 stars.
Slightly hole-in-the-wall, slightly out of the way, but bustling with patrons during the lunch hour thanks to UCSB students and business parks nearby.

My companion had the bbq chicken sandwich, which looked very yummy, and she claimed was yummy where there was bbq sauce. Mysteriously, the bbq sauce was only on one precise half side of the sandwich. Imagine a grilled chicken breast with bbq sauce, served between a wheat burger bun with lettuce and tomato. Plus a little iceberg salad on the side. 

I had the taquitos, which were stuffed with chicken, and they were actual pieces of chicken strips that ran the length of the taquito. This is the first place in Santa Barbara that had big pieces of chicken like that - all others are shredded. They were yummy!

There are also burgers and fries, looked like a burger, fry and drink combo is about $5.50. Then there are burritos, fajitas, quesadillas, tostadas, but really the menu looked quite simple.

Counter guys were very friendly, eager to suggest items I might like when I started hemming and hawing over choices. Maybe they just wanted me to hurry up, but they accomplished that while also making me feel good. One guy also thanked my friend for bringing a newbie into the Cal Taco fold.

There is seating inside and outside under an awning, so you get some shade. You order and pay at the counter, and pick up your stuff when they call your number. Note that number calling does not occur outside, so if you want to sit outside, you need to linger by the door to overhear  your number."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"LOVE!

Sun-Tues they have amazing cheap burger specials WHICH YOU SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. They might take awhile making your burger but its the best plain cheeseburger/hamburger you can order. 

Also, if you squeen a lime on one of your burgers... even better. I love their fries and onion rings. And I also love the free ranch they provide :) Owner might be a little stuck up and mean, but in the end she means well."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,No more butts. Good after surf burgers and tacos. Thanks fit listening to the reviews!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Was in town visiting my folks for the day and decided to get a quick lunch.  Cal taco is near my parent's home and was always a hidden gem to the neighborhood.

Ordered three steak tacos, a cheese quesadilla, and a steak sandwich with no mayo and no onions to go for my gf and I.  Get home and start grubbing.  Steak taco was good.  Opened up the steak sandwich and didn't see any jack cheese that should be in there based on the menu description.  Bite into the sandwich and immediately notice there is onions and man-sauce (mayo).  Childhood memories SHATTERED."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,It's like the Habit (my all time favorite local burger place) but even closer to where I live! Yay! Delicious charburgers and the fries are just how I like them. The burgers aren't gourmet~ they're just the classic burger that you crave after a day at the beach. The staff are friendly and the dine in area is easy going.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I am a regular at this place, and they are GREAT!
I love their Veggie Burgers, I come here at least once a week to get them.
Their mild salsa is too good to give up and they give free drinks to UCSB students, whats not to love about the place!

For fans of meat, u should stop by Sundays and get their 2 dollar Charburger. I think they have it Mondays and Tuesdays as well, but Im not always sure, since I never get it."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"California Taco, I thought it was called Cal Taco. 

Pretty good burgers, sandwiches and tacos joint stashed awkwardly along Hollister next to a liquor store.  

I'd say that their burgers are almost as good as the habit.  The menu layout, font and selection looks awfully similar to the habit's which makes me think that they're under the same ownership? 

Either way, it's can't go wrong fast food.  I like hitting it up on the way back from bacara beach."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"I was at a conference nearby and was craving something other than hotel food.

So I 'yelped' [can't believe that's a verb now] Cal Taco.

To be honest, I had low expectations so I wasn't expecting anything stellar.

There are seats inside and out. The woman who helped me was extremely nice - we had a conversation about allergies.

I ordered a steak burrito with everything aside from lettuce and beans. 

**I know it's against the burrito religion to avoid beans but I am not a fan. They simply fill space and don't add flavor for me.  I excluded lettuce because it tends to add too much moisture to the burrito, thus leaving a pool of liquid at the end of the burrito. Trust me, I've thought about these things a lot.

I also got fries and a large drink. My total was around $12.

The burrito itself was pretty good. The steak was decently season and the melted cheese in its core brought out the flavor.  The salsa that they provide was actually decently good as well and mixed well with my meal.  

Being that there aren't many choices in the area, I'd recommend Cal Taco for some decent burritos."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Cal Taco has really great Tacos and Burgers! The salsa is homemade and very delicious. The guacamole??! Yum! I have tried several different things off of the menu from breakfast to lunch and everything is really good. The staff is really friendly and the place is always clean! Great food and Great prices! Not to mention the wait time is short.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,The best. Very good and very friendly staff.  Highly recommended. The name throws you off. Much more than tacos.  The breakfast burrito is amazing
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I come here every Saturday morning before work for the Breakfast Burrito's. I was really excited when I heard Cal Taco was serving breakfast! These breakfast burritos are basic but delicious! Eggs, potatoes, cheese and your choice of breakfast meat all for $6! Where else in town can you get a sizable, filling and inexpensive breakfast burrito? On average I'd say they run anywhere from $7-$9. Give it a try, the price is right and they're good!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,This place is pretty good! It's sad that they have raised the prices so much in recent years and got rid of their breakfast burritos. It's still a good spot to try out if you're in the area. Try the pineapple shake!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Hubs and kids and I started going to Cal Taco about 15 yrs ago, and have since moved to the East coast and back. Off and on over the yrs we stop in for a bite and see how the place is doing. I was especially curious because of the great reviews. We went today for lunch before hubs flew to NYC for business. We only had about 45 minutes before we had to schlep him to the airport (looove the convenience of living 5 minutes from the aiport, and hubs always flies out from here and connects via LAX or Phoenix). 

Sundays are $1.89 charburger specials. We got a couple of those, some fries, a double char with cheese, fish tacos, and steak tacos. The place was packed, but we managed to get a booth quickly and somehow squeezed two parents and 3 young adults into a four seater. The food took just a few minutes and was solid overall. Aside from the fries which were warmish and sorta limp, we were all satisfied. The chars are smallish but satisfy for those who don;t want to pig. My son who had the double with cheese said he was stuffed and couldn't finish the last two bites which I brought home for the dog who was highly appreciative. BTW my son said even though the char was great, the Habit's is slightly superior. (And I hafta say, Habit's fries are better, too).

My other son who got the fish tacos said they were great--and he is extremely picky. He ordered two at $3 apiece. They came on soft corn tortillas with decent sized pieces of grilled fish, shredded romaine, tomato cubes and shredded jack. They were delish enough that he didn't even use the salsas from the salsa bar--a fairly wimpy green tomatillo and a tomatoey/cilantro one that was flavorful but not at all spicy. Half a point off because even though this place is not truly authentically Mexican, they shouldn't call themselves Cal-""Taco"" and not offer at least one kick-ass salsa. The steak soft tacos, at $2.75 apiece were perfectly acceptable and came exactly as the fish ones, but with cheddar cheese. 

The crowd was low-key, Goleta, beach-casual. Strictly shorts and Ts. Families, couples, just a nice mix. The service is friendly and efficient, atmosphere nice and breezy on a beautiful summer day, with the option of eating outdoors on their little patio. 

I would like to go back and try their teriyaki chix sandwich since people rave about them.  All in all, a perfectly acceptable experience but didn't knock my socks off. Maybe next time."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"We are regulars here for the Sunday-special charbroiled burgers. Less than 2 bucks for one of the tastiest burgers in town. But the secret is out so it can get a bit crowded.

Milkshakes and fries are good, too. Must say I've never tried any of their Mexican fare except for chips and salsa, which were above average

Owner is friendly and takes care of his customers. Give this little place a try."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This place confuses me. It's kind of like The Habit, but not.  It's good, delivers, and is not in the same boring Camino Real area.  It's off the path a little bit, which I like.  Overall not bad."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I love this place. Delicious burgers, mellow atmosphere, decent prices, what more could a girl (and her man) want?"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"They have a breakfast menu now, I had they're chorizo burrito, they're menu says it comes with mashed potatoes but luckily it's ur regular potatoes, it was good."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,Been coming here for ten + years Usually love this place. Last time I ate here my burger was cold - today they straight up forgot my order - 40 minutes later - still waiting -? Owners or staff changed recently - maybe it's me - but it's probably not -
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"We came through here on our way home from Solvang with another family this summer. We actually drove out of our way because we had been impressed by the reviews. 

We had to go back to the counter three times to have them fix a simple order for a hamburger (because the first time they just wiped the ketchup off the patty), then the second time they still put ketchup on it. Each time we got attitude from the server, including her sarcastically snapping back at us. 

Never again."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"So good! If crunchy, crispy onion rings are your thing, Cal Taco's are the best! It's the same burgers/fries as The Habit but with the added 'Mexican' menu."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Habit burgers here on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday for $1.99 are a great deal. However, I got a couple cold burgers once, leading me to believe that they'd been sitting around rather than being cooked to order, and haven't been back."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,First time here I thought their cal burrito was the same as a California burrito. It wasn't but they offered to make it into since it was my first time here. Excellent service and delicious food.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Really good food & Great burgers, however the service has taken a turn for the worse after who I think is to be the owners wife,  decided to become a. Regular full time employee.  Her attitude sucks & she's really rude. I've called to place orders & had her answer rudely as if she was mad that they were so busy.  I've been placed on hold for extended periods as well. The older gentleman was much pleasant & never lost his cool during the chaotic lunch hour.  Wish he'd come back & run the show regularly."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,I'm not sure about all the bad reviews I come here all the time and I quite enjoy their burgers. I would probably rate them 4 stars only because they are obviously not a 5 star restaurant but their service is great and I added an extra star to make up for the jerks who don't appreciate simple good food.  Their ranch is great for dipping if you like to dip your fries and yes it's quite similar to The Habit but I like that. Thumbs up for me
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Been living here nearly a year and pass this place every day on my bicycle, coming home from work. My roommate raves about this place. He loves that the char burgers are $1.50 on Sundays. I decided to stop by recently and the blue-eyed dude behind the counter took an order for something that was not on the menu: a steak burrito with only beans, rice and a little cheese, he even offered me some extra spicy salsa made with grilled tomatoes and chiles (just like the kind I make).

Why didn't I give this place a 5 star rating? I'm half Mexican from the San Fernando Valley, and the tacos are just not authentic enough for me. Based on their awesome burritos (or at least the ones that were specially ordered for me), I expected carne asada with salsa verde on a soft corn tortilla, but I got ground beef in hard taco shells. Not their fault really, just not what I expected from them.

Otherwise, this place is pretty damn awesome, the people who work there are nice and the prices are great. I'll definitely make this place my go-to whenever I feel too tired to cook for myself (which is quite often, I'm afraid to say). And of course, try other items, that are actually on the menu... :)"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I love this place! it is a little ""hole in the wall"" on Hollister next to the dog day care and a liquor store but is cute and clean and delicious. I don't' know it is owned by the same people but it reminds me of Hamburger Habit, but cheaper, and with tacos too. If you haven't tried this place, do! you won't be disappointed."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"One of the best burritos in the are for sure. Super duper. As for the quality of food, A+.

The only downside is the location, a bit in a weird place down from Public Storage, but great food and service nonetheless!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"I've heard a lot about Cal Taco, and we finally visited there on our last trip to S.B. My overall impression is that as an alternative to The Habit - owners are brothers - this is an excellent compromise choice when one friend wants a charburger and another craves Mexican food. My dad loves the taquitos here; however, my wife and I both thought our burritos were too, well, American. (They tasted fine, just in a pseudo Baja Fresh sort of way.)

So ... if BOTH friends crave either a burger or Mexican food, I might just drive an extra couple minutes and head straight to The Habit or another, neighborhood Mexican diner. 

Good place, reasonable prices, and its three stars are well-earned."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,I'm not sure about all the bad reviews I come here all the time and I quite enjoy their burgers. Their ranch is great for dipping if you like to dip your fries and yes it's quite similar to The Habit but I like that. Thumbs up for me
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Great burgers though the worker didn't quite describe the burgers quite well but overall a great place to eat. I enjoyed the Double Char Burger more than I expected! Coming back for more!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This place is tasty. I always struggle between getting a burger or tacos, both are great options. The location in a little strip mall way out on Hollister is odd at first but it is worth the trip. The owner and girl at the register are always super nice. Being where it is located there is out door seating of course which is always a nice way to enjoy the lunch hour."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"3.5!

A nondescript joint in a nondescript section of Goleta/Ellwood Hollister. I certainly don't feel ""the magic"" in its ambiance.
However, the food is perfectly good, and they make quick work of getting it channeled straight into your mouth once the order is placed at the counter.

They have burger prep down, it was ready before I'd even settled into my booth. Fresh, hot, juicy, with a side of fries. After tax, a mere $5.17, leaving me stuffed and stupified in food coma the rest of the afternoon. The burger, fries and drink combo is $6.

Dining friends got the fish tacos and steak burrito - they took longer to serve up and that was fine by us - hooray for fresh prepared.  The Mexican items were a few dollars more than my burger, and were also more amply portioned. 
I tried some of the tacos myself recently. The chicken taco came with a crunchy shell, and the seasoning left the chicken a little dry and a little bland. The fish taco was very juicy, and not fried, and came with salsa, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. I ate about a third of it with a fork before I was comfortable picking up the tortillas and eating it as a taco. Personally, I think the burger and fries is the better option over tacos. 

Clientele, like the business itself, was nondescript. Soft pink business park folk, some weathered blue-collar types, mostly gringos. Ah, Goleta. 

Current special: $1.49 charburgers on Sundays. So stop by there after you buy your pallets of mayonnaise at Costco down the road.

Finally, I asked the main guy behind the counter - was Cal Taco short for California Taco, or is there some guy named Cal back there. Answer: the former. Mystery solved."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Haven't been here in a while but it seems the food isn't up to the same quality it used to be. I ordered a #2 meal and a veggie burger. When I went to big up my food I asked about the additional fries and soda that comes with the #2. He stated I didn't order the meal. I don't understand how #2 sounds like charburger only but whatever. Fries were cold and veggie bun was soggy from the ""head"" of lettuce that hasn't been drained. Won't be going back any time soon."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Loved this place!  Yummy fresh food at super reasonable prices. Nice people, too. Fixed an order goof with sincere good will and an appreciative attitude."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Came in because we saw there was an axxess BOGO deal and always passed by wondering how Cal Taco is. We ordered an adobado breakfast burrito combo (comes with coffee and hash brown) for $14. The service was fast and the restaurant looked clean, however, we weren't too impressed with the quality and taste of the food. The potatoes in the burritos were undercooked and there were large chunks of pineapple in the burrito. The pineapple is understood because we chose adobado meat, but the chunks were way too large and hard. Lastly, the hashbrown had a taste to it that we couldn't put a finger on but was not particularly good.

Saw all the great reviews so sorry to say that it wasn't our cup of tea. Try it for yourself!

- Jess H."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,They have the best burger I have ever and they're very clean very good service and they nice people
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"On Sundays they have a special where their char burger is only 1.50! It was pretty substantial in size and I had a side of onion rings.  YUMMY! The decor was lacking, but who can complain when you're there with good company and food.  It is a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.  I love coming up to Goleta/Santa Barbara on the weekends to get away from Los Angeles."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Not a bad Mexican restaurant at all...and they have burgers also. So the choices are excellent and it's a great place to take the family.  The onion rings here are straight up unbelievable.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Great food for cheap. Tacos, burgers, burritos, taquitos, tostadas, fries, onion rings and shakes!

Never gotten anything bad here."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Went here to get dinner for me and my son dinner and I ordered him the chicken nugget meal when my order was ready I asked for BBQ sauce for my sons meal. I was told I had to pay for it, who doesn't give free BBQ sauce??? Are you doing that poorly that you have to charge for everything??? Won't be going back. Next they'll be charging for napkins."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Under new ownership, prices went up, quality is down, owners changed menu, it's not the same.

Same food, worse atmosphere, and higher prices."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Cal Taco has been consistently awesome for the past 10+ years I've been a regular there.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Great variety (char burgers, tacos, breakfast), good value and fresh food! I love this neighbored place. I've always had great service too!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,Came here for breakfast ... They do not know how to make a good breakfast. Everything is canned/processed and bland other than the high salt content. The ham tastes like spam. Terrible coffee. Go someplace else for breakfast.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"We ""discovered"" this gem of a place about a week ago and have been eating there frequently and telling friends about it. The food is fresh and delicious, I mean delicious.  They have reasonable prices, which in this town is hard to find. We tried everything from the char burgers to taquitos to nachos to tortas and no disappointment."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Great eats all around the menu. The cheap burgers are always a hit, as are the taquitos, sandwiches and burritos. The service can a bit slow at times, but it's worth the wait for this relaxed and pleasant spot."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"My fiance and i eat here SO often, and we've taken all of our friends and family whenever they visit.  I LOVE this place.  We've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and it's all delicious and fresh.  The staff are really friendly and helpful.  If you're looking for a super casual but delicious meal, go there!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Owned by the Habit? a  question i never found the answer to.

Anyway, shark tacos are bomb, yea i said shark tacos.  Kind of random but the owner convinced me to try them one time and i loved em. 

The burgers and fries are quite good too."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"3.5 rating-- rounding to 4. 

This place is a mix of American/Mexican food, which is great when you're in the mood for both. 

Best onion rings in the area, served hot and crunchy! They also serve the thicker cut fries, which is perfect when you're not in the mood for thin shoestring fries. They also ask you if you want ranch when you order fries, instead of the other way around. 

The charburgers are pretty good, kind of a mix between Deja Vu's burgers in IV and In-n-Out's. People behind the counter are always nice. 

Burritos aren't that great because they seem like Americanized versions of the real deal, and I question the meat quality. But if you're looking for a good burger and sides, this is the place."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I love this place:  excellent food, friendly service, and plenty of tables to sit at. My favorites here include the barbecue chicken sandwich, the french fries, and the milkshakes. They also have decent Mexican food and excellent salsa. The owner (?) often takes my order and even delivers it to my table when I don't hear my number called.

This is a great place to go for lunch, but be aware that it's also popular with the local high school students and as such becomes somewhat busy around their lunchtime.

PS: the American portion of the menu is almost identical to The Habit's menu (another fine restaurant in town); apparently the owners are related."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Really like the hard tacos and steak burritos. The char burgers are ok to good. Great fries and friendly owner/people.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I like to come here for lunch when I'm town. Friendly staff, clean, great prices, and food is always fresh and tasty."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"I have mixed reviews so I figured a 3 is middle of the road. I got a burger and fries. Keep in mind I did not try the Mexican food. 
I found the service pleasant. The place seemed clean though it's small so I don't know that if wanna bring the family to eat there. Prefer to get it to go. 
It was also happy hour so it was cheap. Just a little over $5- for burger fries and a bottle of water. 
Burger was decent and hot. So why the 3? I found the bun to be a little too cooked.(almost burned) And the fries weren't good. They were way over cooked. It tasted like bad oil or like the had already been fried and were fried a second time. Most of them were super crunchy and dark brown."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Awesome awesome breakfast burrito - hot and fresh! On par with our favorite breakfast burrito in LA.

Took a chance and stopped here to get some breakfast burritos to go on our drive to LA. My boyfriend got a burrito with both bacon and chorizo and has not stopped taking about how good it tastes. Mine with just bacon was great as well.  

Wish I could try everything on the menu. Thanks for the delicious meal!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"My daughter and I had breakfast here yesterday because every other place in town had a long wait time. It was our first time at CalTaco and, although there were only two other patrons in the place, we were hungry and didn't want to wait elsewhere.  Boy, we both wished that we had waited anywhere else. Haha!  We each ordered the meat breakfast plate. She had sausage, I had ham, each of which tasted like the cheap stuff you can sometimes buy at a gas station convenience store. However, it was the potatoes that would have been laughable if we hadn't had to buy them (it?).  The scoop of watery freeze-dried wannabe hash browns was the biggest let down.   However, the bathroom was very clean, coffee was good and the counter person was very sweet!  They have a covered patio which was enjoyable on of those gorgeous Santa Barbara mornings."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"The worst Mexican I've ever had in my entire life by far and nothing even comes close (I've had some bad food over the years). WHY WOULD YOU EVER PUT PRE-MADE (boxed) MASHED POTATOES IN A BREAKFAST BURRITO? WHY? I thought maybe I'll give their lunch menu a try and not jump to conclusions. Heck maybe it might be better.. I had a ""Carne Asada"" burrito and it tasted absolutely atrocious. They put a can of refried beans that weren't even heated all the way. They used burnt niblets of mystery meat to maybe ""save"" money and cut corners. I would say Chipotle is more authentic than this place but even that's giving them too much credit. Taco Bell is a better comparison with the slight edge to TBL. DO NOT GO HERE, but hey at least your meal comes with a few free chips."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"First time to eat here... from what I've heard, this is the OG Habit burger due to how it's history of ownership started and parted (especially looking at the menus- so similar except there's Mexican food at Cal taco).

Ordered a double char with grilled onions,  bacon, and cheddar cheese. So bomb! Had it as a to go order so didn't get to eat it right away but it was still delicious. The bun was soaked in saucy goodness and the burger was huge and filling. 

Thanks for the great food!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Being a SoCal girl this is the only place I have found with decent cheap burritos that taste like home. Love the bean and cheese and the veggie burrito but have never been disappointed by any of the burger options either!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,Not real Mexican food. The burgers looked really goos but was r sry disappointed with the quesadilla that was stored with lettuce and got soggy. The beans in the bean and cheese burrito did not taste authentically Mexican. The steak burritos had lettuce in it.  But I saw someone get onion rings and they looked light and crispy.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Delicious, fast, and cheap. I had a steak burrito and it was delicious and full of fresh ingredients. Everything you expect for a sub-$10 dinner."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"First of all, its called CAL TACO

Its all about the BBQ Chicken Sandwich. mmmmmmm.... whenever I come back to SB I must go get one. Their fries are good as are their milkshakes.

And when I rarely branch out, the taquitos are good, so are their burritos and charburgers. 

And they get an extra star for having Cherry Coke in their coke machine....such a lovely treat. I'm telling you, there is nothing like a BBQ Chicken Sandwich (which is also offered in Teriyaki), fries and a cherry coke. I usually I'm convinced in splitting a chocolate milkshake with my mother. A meal I gladly forget my diet for."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Stop here for great Mexican food! Yummy guacamole, salsa bar, and chips. Nice tacos (hard and soft options), rice, and beans. You get great sized portions! Sitting outside is nice. Great road trip stop!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This is my favorite place to get a breakfast burrito in town!
It used to be the Cantina in IV, but after they shut down, I've been searching for a place that would do breakfast burritos the same and this is it! (Only thing they are missing is some pico de gallo inside)
I really like the way they mash the potato, rather it be in chunks.

I usually get the bacon breakfast burrito, add rice (I think it's 75 cents to add) and cut in half!! 
About $7 total for one and 1/2 of one burrito is enough to leave me satisfied.

They have a self serve salsa bar with only 3 to choose from, but I just go with salsa verde. 

I usually call in for pick up and they are quick, takes about only 10 mins. The manager usually remembers me b/c I always order the same thing.

Overall my go-to for breakfast burritos in the Goleta area~"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Great fajitas tacos! So much food at a great price. They were very flavorful. Fresh brewed ice tea is always a plus since most places are lazy and have fake soda fountain tea which is terrible. 
Can't wait to get a burrito next visit."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Went to Cal Taco for my very very late lunch brake, I have been to this establishment before but this time I felt like they needed a review. went in pretty close to closing time. Walk in hungry unsure of what to get, and meet cashier/associate Rachel she helped me get/find what my stomach truly wanted to eat their new chorizo burger. It was amazing will get again! Her attitude, since of humor, and professionalism made my dinning experience one for the ages can't wait to go back to this establishment and get my Burger on 5 out of 5!!! Or maybe I'll stop by for their morning scrumptious breakfast burritos."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"""Beef Jerky Burritos""
I'm gonna chalk this up to the cooks being too lazy and having a bad day. I ordered 2 steak burritos and the mean way unbelievably dry! Also clumps of stale burnt rice. I tried the first one and then the second one. I had throw them both away... waste of 20 bucks at least the chips were good... I'm pissed and disappointed"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Good stuff, I love going on Sundays while they have the deals on their char burgers, definitely worth the trip especially if you're a starving college student , the staff is awesome"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"We came here on a Saturday for lunch and we used the access buy one hamburger get one free deal. We both got the burgers with cheese. After receiving our burgers, we both noticed that the burgers were dry and cold. My husband had the fries and he pulled out a french fry that had gone in the fryer a couple times. The overall feeling of the food here is that there is not a great deal of competency or pride in the cooking here. There are so few items that they should be so easy to cook everything properly. In a world full of burgers why choose mediocrely?"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Decent burger reminisce of The Habit; a bit pricier but perhaps better portioned and more going on between the buns.  

Companion had the turkey burger which was definitely a good choice; plenty of burger and flavor. 

Definitely need to explore more of the menu."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"For fast food, this place is consistently putting out pretty decent food.  Good burgers.  The Mexican food is good too.  My wife and daughter always like the steak fajitas or chicken fajitas.  I like their tacos, usually beef or carnitas pork.   Salsas are tasty.  

The price is low, making this place our go to when we decide not to cook and instead want something easy to grab and go."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Burgers are similar to habit, but not quite as good (I think they are just too overcooked - I should probably just ask them to cook it medium next time). I actually get the fajitas typically. They hold their own against a place like Chili's for half the price. Service is usually fast and friendly.  It's a solid place to come for lunch."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"We are playing in a baseball tournament and are not from the area. We needed something quick, yummy adorable and close. This place did just that! We loved it! Friendly, prompt service and amazing amazing salsa bar!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Oh Cal Taco. I love that I used to live right down the street from you and used to have your yummy burgers.  Never tried the tacos, which is pretty weird, but the burgers and fries are super good.  Plus, I love that you were located next to the liquor store that was owned by a very disgruntled man.  Too cute.  :)  A whole in the wall, nothing fancy.  Good times."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This is the place to eat when you need a quick and delicious and fast meal. Caltaco's menu is full of burgers, Mexican standards, and delicious sides. This is the one place where everyone in the family can find something they like. Fountain drinks, beer on tap ($3/4 pints / $10/12 pitchers), and a salsa bar helps build out the experience. Friendly service and just a bit off the beaten path. There is an outdoor patio for seating. They also have a breakfast and regular menu. Stop in when you need that quick meal or dream about perfectly crisp onion rings. I love how they include ranch dressing with everything. Remember to end your meal with the $1 soft serve cone! Stop by soon!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"The first few times we went to Cal Taco, i ordered taquitos and such- which i think are good!
BUT i've heard/ read that the burgers are really where its at.
So the other day Ryan and I stopped here to try the burgers and we were NOT disappointed. 
I would say its up there with The Habit- i especially enjoyed the grilled onions (upon request) I would definitely recommend trying the burgers, you may be surprised with how good they are!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Pretty darn tasty (cheap) food, served fairly quickly (5-10min) and not bad prices if you don't spring for the add-ons like bacon/guac...

One of the best $5-ish cheeseburgers I've ever had, hands-down!

The breakfast is also a fairly good deal. Love the 2x4 combo with eggs over easy... Breakfast burrito is tasty but would be better if they stuffed some hash browns in there. Also I ordered bacon and received sausage instead.

The chicken burrito... just decent. Not as delicious (or as big) as what you'd get for a similar price at Chipotle or Freebirds.

No major complaints, though... service is friendly, they consistently hook it up with the ranch dressing, and the green salsa es muy bueno.

This is one not-quite-fast-food joint that will probably receive an absurd amount of business from me in days to come. It's not the healthiest option, I'll admit... but sometimes it just hits the spot."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,Ordered for dinner tonight- such a waste of money. The fries was saggy- I'm assuming it's been sitting for hours.....the tacos? piece of crap.....I should have gone to Taco Bell instead only if I've known I'm going to get this shitty food. All went to trash....
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,The service was fast and friendly. I wasn't in love with their bean and cheese burrito but they have a decent salsa bar and you can't beat their Sunday charburger deal.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,I used to go to Cal Taco when I lived in Goleta.  The beef burrito was very good and the burgers were on par with In N Out.  The manager and staff were always friendly.  It's a nice neighborhood joint.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I love Cal Taco....I loved it when Chris ran it and I love it now when Jessica runs it...I love Cal Taco because the food is really awesome!  And the prices are really reasonable.  It makes it a no brainer on the nights when I am too tired to figure out dinner....I love the option of whole wheat bun on my char burger and I always get my fries extra crispy with ranch and they are amazing!  And the restaurant is always spotlessly clean...

I am grateful that Jessica, who has two darling children back at home, gets up everyday, makes the long trek from Buellton to keep Cal Taco up and running for all of us in Goleta...it can't be easy...I would be lost without Cal Taco!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Delicious and satisfying. I had a steak burrito and a pint. Super friendly, reasonable price and quick service. Outside seating was nice since I was super hungry and wanted to eat right away. 
I'll be back for sure.! Yummy."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"I used to come here for the atmosphere more than the food, but the place recently changed ownership and seems to not recognize regulars anymore. The food is solid and the menu mentions everything on the burgers, tacos, etc so it's easy to order stuff without tomatoes or whatever."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Quite possibly one of the best hamburger joints around town. I actually like them mire than in-n-out! They also serve Mexican food! Sunday $1.50 charburgers are awesome too!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"First thing first the lady working the counter was nice/friendly. 

That being said I ordered food to go even though I live a min away due to self quarantine. It was obvious my burger was not made fresh and was made earlier for an order that probably wasn't picked up. It was stone cold all around and the buns were hard as rock. The fries were hot and the Gf's burger was warm/good but I couldn't couldn't even get pass the first bite of mine. Really disappointed as this place used to be good but has gone down hill. Shame."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"My mouth waters just from thinking about the food I get here. Their chorizo breakfast burrito and fajita taco plate are my ultimate favorites. But everything is good. Love their fresh spicy salsa too, delicious!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This is a great place. Not a 5-star restaurant but it has the basic burger or taco. If you want a quick bite, it is one of my go to places. 

French fries are good, staff is attentive, owner is polite in his introverted sort or way, the place is clean the condiments (salsa, peppers) are good."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"We are long time customers, thought it was about time we published a review.
Great hard shell ground beef tacos, tostadas, and char-burgers.
This place can get busy at lunch time; however, it is worth waiting for...
Highly Recommended!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I really like Cal Taco and I have to say I'm a fan since I've eaten there a few times now. They have a variety of menu items and they are all pretty good. The charburgers actually taste like charburgers, I like them with everything, onions, cheese, bacon, bbq sauce. They have good sides. I've had their onion rings and zucchini stick and they are typical affairs, pretty darn good.  Their burritos and tacos are good as well, they use good chicken meat in their tacos. The service is good and the owner is friendly. It's one of my favorite places to get a burger when I'm in the neighborhood. Cal Taco is comparable to In and Out Burgers and The Habit but with a bigger menu."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Ok burger at a cheap price from a place who's name is taco.

Not sure how I've missed this place, working down the street from it for years. I read reviews claiming the Cal-Taco burger is an acceptable replacement for The Habit. I can't get behind that statement. Let's see why.

Location
This all depends on where you're coming from, right? So I'm looking at parking and there's more options at The Habit even if it does fill up at lunch. 

Atmosphere
This too is not a strong point between the two. Cal Taco is sterile with no character and very limited seating inside with better seating options outside. The Habit's backdrop is Old Town Goleta with only cramped, outside seating. No winner in this category. 

Before I get to a taste test, lets discuss the bottom line.
Burger comparison, dollar for dollar, Cal Taco/Habit (2015/05)
Single              $3.50/$2.95 (CT increase of 18.64%)
Double             $4.50/$3.95 (CT increase of 13.92%)
Cheese            $0.50/$0.50 TIE
Single Combo  $6.95/$5.95 (CT increase of 16.81%)
Double Combo $7.95/$6.95 (CT increase of 12.58%)

Taste
Cal-Taco adds fresh lettuce, tomato and onion on a cheap bun but there does not seem to be any seasoning in the charpatty. It is juicy and drips down your arm so that's a good sign. There's just not much taste to it. The fries are good. I like a larger fry and these fit the bill.

My final thoughts on Cal-Taco is they are no way a substitute for the highly regarded Habit by price alone. Toss in that I feel there's less seasoning in the meat here, I'll give it a solid 2 where the description fully fits, ""I've experienced better.""
If you need a quick fix from a mediocre burger and are West of Los Carneros Road, it will be easier to hit up Cal-Taco. But is your happiness worth it? I think not."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Change of ownership?  They no longer have $1.99 burgers on Sun, Mon, Tues., and the burger I had last Sun was overcooked and lukewarm (again).  They definitely do not cook their food to order.  Not going back."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Four stars simply because I was surprised by the existence of Cal Taco, and the fact that they delivered tasty fish tacos.

Cal Taco isn't that much further from Costco, but is definitely easy to miss. It is part of a small shopping spot composed of basically 3 businesses. If you continue West on Hollister past the Costco shopping center it will be on your right. It is definitely worth a try if you have never been, and my recommendation is the fish tacos (soft/hard) if you are going for Mexican, or, the charburgers if you are in the mood for a hamburger. Chicken soft tacos weren't too bad either."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Driving through and got hungry. Used yelp to find this gem.  Asked for steak burrito but was steared to the in-house made carnitas and I'm glad they did.  Great choice and the fresh salsa are awesome.   Would have given 5 stars but no Horchata and that is a must.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"I'd probably like it better if I didn't live so close and have to hear the music blaring. It just makes me not want to go because it feels they don't have concerns for people. The food is ok, nothing to write home about. And parking is limited."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Mexican restaurant should have nachos down pat. Mediocre at best the chef skimped on meat overdid the beans, and poured watery salsa over them. Finished as much as I could asked for a refill on my drink,NO WE DON'T DO THAT..... Last week we filled and  refilled our drinks... Restaurants routine is to provide refills as it is one of the highest profit margins.  Our family  and circle of friends will easily find a replacement to our weekly meeting place."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,If want an ok burger and a beer this is a good place to eat.  Next door is a liquor store so you can get one for the road.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Used to go here back when I went to UCSB and had the mad munchies :)

I've only had the char bugers, fries, and zucchini sticks, so this review is only for those. They're pretty decent, especially if you're too lazy to cook a burger or fries, or don't know where to even buy zucchini. lol.

They have a burger special (forgot what day), try it then..."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Cal Taco is the best... burgers are cheap and easily the most tasty in town!  The lady that works the front is enjoyable and always in a great mood!

I love Cal Taco and world recommend it to any one in the area."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Place has changed waaaaay too much. This burger joint used to be known for their friendly service, great burgers, and chill vibe but it seems that their new ownership has just sucked the originality out of it. It has definitely become more corporate.

I had their carne asada burrito and it was filled with more rice and beans than anything else, and the amount of sour cream was ridiculous, it  just tasted so mushy and pudgy.  

Sad to see a place that was once considered  a candidate for the best burger in town to just  below than average burger joint."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"while visiting a friend in sb, i was craving something american and my friend i was visiting decided to head out near isla vista.  however, it was already 3:40pm and my die hard-warriors fan friend did not want to miss the game which was going to start in the next 20 mins. knowing i like fried zucchini, he brought me to cal taco !

its one of those small-business fastfood joints that we all love to go to when were in highschool.  first thing i noticed that the menu is half american and half mexican.  craving a burger, we both ordered a char burger with jack cheese, chocolate milk shake, and zucchini sticks.  They have a salsa bar and yellow peppers available on the side.

the owner is a nice guy who seems to love his job and i noticed he posted photos of his kids and their crayon drawings on the side of the wall.

when we got our food, we raced home for the game.  Unwrapping my burger and with the first bite, it feels like that homemade kind of feeling.  Melted jack cheese, tomato, lettuce, cheese, mayo and the char beef: nice and simple. Zucchini sticks were nicely fried and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Enjoy them alone or cooled with ranch dip.

It was a good lunch :)  but the warriors lost.. my friend was groaning the rest of the day while secretly i was chuckling at his sorrow.

BTW THE HIGHSCHOOL NEAR THIS RESTAURANT IS KATY PERRY'S OLD HIGHSCHOOOOLLL!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,It's been a long time since I've been here and the burgers were very tasty and the ingredients were fresh. Not as laid back as it once was but neither is Goleta. The prices here are still a notch lower than the Habit.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Meh. I wanted to like it more, but it was just okay. The prices are cheap which is nice, but the food quality is pretty low."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I had a charburger and a carnitas burrito. Both were absolutely excellent. What made the burger stand out is that the lettuce was good and fresh. Even though it was iceberg lettuce, it had more green than white. I'm livid at how rare this is from a fast food place."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Steak taco salad is awesome! The perfect size to finish and not over eat. Not in the nicest building and its not obvious as you drive. But the food is good and they dont skimp on the meat here. Service was fairly quick.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Came again and ordered double char with grilled onions and cheddar cheese (yes you can choose what kind of cheese you want) and it was so bomb!

Another great burger was consumed here! Thanks again!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Sitting in the restaurant now and shocked how long the cashier was talking to the customer ordering in front of me, talking about her personal life for at least 5 minutes with 3 people waiting in line. Never coming back here again."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Great burgers. The chicken quesadilla is my favorite, it's fulfilling, and delicious."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Best burgers and milkshakes ever. Wonderful staff who've been there a long time. Makes the Habit look like Carl's Jr. Chris, the owner does a wonderful job and recognizes and engages his customers."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"The food here is delicious but the manager is horrible shes disrespectful and very rude. I used to come in and have lunch at least once a week but now I just can't make myself go into the place. I've never felt so uncomfortable to order in a restaurant. Really wish they would get rid of the rude women so I could come back in to enjoy the wonderful food. I'm giving this place a 5 stars for the food but for customer service I have to give a -1 star. I've walked into the restaurant and have witnessed the women yelling at the cooks degrading them, when you try to order food she rushes you and gets your order wrong and blames you for it.  This little burger joint can be the best pearl in goleta but she just runs the people away. Very sad."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,I ordered a breakfast burrito and to my surprise there was a thick black hair inside of it. When i complained they decided they were gonna make me a new one but I asked for my money back. Never did I get an I'm sorry. Sam which what looked like to be the manager was rude. I was with a group of friends and when they asked for their money back because of the incident that happened he rudely said no and basically said you're stuck w the food. The worse customer service anyone can ask for! Never will we return to this establishment!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,Food is amazing great service usually BUT 30 mins ago had the worst experience a young lady took my phone order she was so rude I heard her cussing under her breath then I went to pick up my food order was wrong she fixed it but made me pay the original bill she rung up gave her a forty she gave me my change she was gonna reimbursed me but didn't know math for shit and argued with me I just said whatever got tipped off 6 dollars
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I was initially disgruntled with their food quality; however, I'm glad I didn't give up on this place. My previous experiences weren't all that great, but going back to give it one last try, I was not disappointed. I will definitely be back here in the near future."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,I would give five stars but I've only tried few items. However those items don't disappoint. Taste good everytime I come haven't had a bad experience
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I ordered a double cheeseburger and was pleasantly surprised when is given a choice on cheese. I got cheddar and it was a nice change from the ubiquitous American. 
Overall this place was a similar experience to the habit but less crowded and I'd say the burger was a little beefier. Fries were good too. I left feeling nicely satisfied."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Love this place.. best burger joint in goleta! a notch above habit because they just started serving beer. Their Mexican food is good as well but i always resort to a burger and a beer with half fries half o rings. True local spot
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Menu that includes your average fare of Mexican food and burger/fries options. Their breakfast burritos use French fries as their potatoes. That's a slight detail we weren't too fond of because it meant the fries in the burrito ended up getting soggy. 

We also ordered the steak and nachos fries which is uniquely an item on the menu with essentially fries and meat with sauces. The meat was a little dry, but these fries for being a thicker cut were crispy. That is a positive for me."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Breakfast burritos here are amazing... Get the fajita breakfast burrito and you can't go wrong. Add beans to make it even better!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,This taco place is tasty however the shells they use for the hard shell tacos seems store bought? Not a actual fried tortilla. Only complaint.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and a steak sandwich (it's tri tip) and they were both good. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the guacamole I added to it was yesterday's. You can tell because it was brown and had that acidic taste guacamole begins to have the 2nd day. Other than that I liked both sandwiches, I'll be back and hopefully the guac is fresh."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"If you haven't had Cal Taco before, you are MISSING OUT! I took my friend here today because he told he had never been here before and I was so shocked! I drove all of the way from the east side of Santa Barbara to Goleta just so he could try a Cal Taco burger! He got the double char burger combo and I got the regular char burger combo. The burgers taste so fresh and the fries have the most perfect crisp! I add jalapeños, bacon AND avocado. (Also I like extra pickles). They are always SO accommodating to make your order just the way you like it. They serve you quick, prices are on point and have a very friendly staff! I would eat at Cal Taco over ""The Habit Burger."" ANY DAY!!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,This is my spot for burgers and steak sandwiches whenever I don't feel like driving too far from home. This is a little low key spot in ellwood that serves tasty burgers and fries. I came here to get a steak sandwich and fries. It was good and a decent size. They definitely hooked up the steak and a lot of fries for a good price.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Fact. I love the Habit.
Fact. I love Mexican food.
Fact. Cal Taco has both.

The closest Habit to work is in IV, and nobody likes driving through IV with all those cyclers everywhere and no place to park. Luckily, Cal Taco has the same charburgers as the Habit. It also has dank Mexican food.

I came here with a coworker last week, and she got the regular charburger with onions. I ordered the adobada burrito, and both were great.

Ya'll probably know what a charburger is, but that adobada burrito was amazing. Decently sized, and I definitely felt full after eating. That adobada has pineapples in its marinade that really brings out a sweet kick to the flavor. Really dig it, and I might just stick to burritos for a while when coming here.

Onion rings are crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, as they should be, and I think you get a good amount for the money.

Also, use your Axxess Card here for a buy 1 entree get 1 free for your first visit! You'll get 10% off your bill for subsequent visits. Great place to stop by for a quick lunch."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,Very sub par breakfast burrito. With a side of frozen/reheated hash brown and old orange juice.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This is a local taco and burger place. I had the Tri tip sandwich and it was great? Santa Maria style., sweet and light smoke. Fresh fresh....

This place is not pretty but I think it's great.

You won't be sorry."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Cal Taco provides decent food at a decent price.  I usually have their steak taco's and the wife says their tostada bowls are the best in town.  Everything I have had off their menu has been decent.  I prefer the amerimex menu to the burgers but the burgers and frys aren't bad. 

It is a small place in an out of the way location.  I would not go out of my way to eat here but it is close, the food is good and the place is clean.  I would recommend it for anyone who finished their shopping at home depot or costco and wanted a bite to eat without breaking the bank."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Just a really good hole in the wall burger joint/Mexican place. Would highly recommend. Had to stop for food on a road trip and decided we'd give this place a try. Friendly service, really awesome food and great portion sizes."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,I ordered delivery and the food was over all fine. The prices however are kind of crazy. A bag of chips was $3.50. Honestly at that point I should have just gone to Los Agaves where they give them to you for free with the meal.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,The hard shell tacos are really good. Just like mom makes them!! The burgers are made with high quality ground beef. The owner told me it is the same patties as The Habit.  Friendly staff and cool owner. There is a small outdoor dining patio. Good food for cheap!!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"After a day at work, nothing sounds better than dinner without having to do dishes. My significant other and I didn't know what we wanted as per usual, but burgers sounded great. 

Despite being called Cal Taco, they serve a variety of burgers here including turkey, veggie, and even chorizo, in addition to Mexican foods like quesadillas, taquitos, and burritos. 

The chorizo called out to me whereas the double char sounded better to my dinner companion. My chorizo burger came with two patties and traditional burger condiments - lettuce, tomato (thought I went without this), onion, mayo, etc. 

What stood out to me was how fresh the ingredients tasted. The onions were crisp and sweet while the chorizo patties had good flavor to them. I took a bite of the double char as well and was struck by how moist the patties were, in contrast to the perfectly toasted sesame bun. 

It came out to be ~$9 for two burgers and a drink (after Axxess deal which was buy one burger, get one free), but worth it because the burgers tasted great and were filling, too. I'll be back to explore the rest of the menu!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Best tortas in town, they are huge and yummy! Would definitely order from here again! Love the portion of fries they give with your combo and they have great customer service"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Food is a solid 4 stars. Good burgers, fries, onion rings, solid burritos and quesadillas. But the reason why this place gets that extra boost towards 5 stars is the incredibly nice service! The blonde hair woman (pretty sure she's the owner?) really takes care of her customers!

For example, my sisters and I were here the other night and after paying for our food and sitting down, the nice lady forgot to tell us about the student discount which would have given us a free drink each. She quickly comes to us, tells us about it, apologizes, and offers us a milk shake on the house! Which was really good too.

Good salsa bar too"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This place is Santa Barbara/Goleta mainstay, it has been here forever and has always been high quality for great price. More recently I got the steak burrito, I normally stick the to the burgers I just have a bad burger habit. The burrito was perfect the steak was super flavorful and came with all the fixings I preferred, stock. The ladies were owning the rush it was 6 or7pm on a Saturday. I really wish I had more money for the tip because these ladies were awesome and friendly in a high stress situation, if anyone has worked in the food service industry you know that it's hot, fast, and those two factor will normally make someone grumpy. I almost cannot wait to eat here again. That's for being open CalTaco. Just a tip if you check in you may qualify for a free cone."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Love love Cal Taco. The steak and chicken fajitas are so flavorful and amazing. The hamburgers fries and onion rings are also a definite hit with my family. My husband loves to stop by for a coffee milkshake too. We usual call in our order ahead of time to cut down on the wait. That way It is usually ready when we walk in the door to pick it up. Love Cal Taco!
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Good food! We ordered to be delivered at work during the COVID-19 shut down 
. The food arrived on time and was delicious. Thanks for being open and office your services during this difficult time. We will order again soon"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Great food for fairly cheap. Their taco salads are amazing.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I enjoy the veggy monkey bowl, but everything else is great also.  I even grab a habit burger once in a while.  I have been here at least 10 times this year. The owner is there alot and he is very nice.  Good people and food, will be back again for sure."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This review is after breakfast which was excellent. We used Axxcess to get BOGO. Love the breakfast burrito. If I say one thing about it... The mashed potatoes can be over whelming so I'd like hash browns instead in there but I still love you, be it I'll mean. Cal Taco has the best burgers in town. I would say identical to The Habit burger. Who established that burger 1st? Cal Taco opened in 1987. I'll leave the rest of that thought to the readers.
JRB"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"The tacos made me sad. The beef had no flavor, the cheese wasn't melted (this is just not acceptable!!), and the only toppings were a few shreds of lettuce and 2-3 pieces of tomatoes. So moral of the story... don't come here for tacos!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,I've been here countless times and throughout the day at that. The food always amazes me especially the muchaca breakfast burrito. So delicious. Very clean dining area and salsa bar. Bathroom is small but clean. The people are always nice and there is plenty of natural light to enjoy the food. This is my goto for breakfast burritos.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Not responding well to opening up. You get the food but they have strict limits on condiments and no drink refills. Hard to understand everybody with masks but when the employees act dumb it makes it worse. No evidence the clean tables between customers which would help more than not giving me a refill. Well just have to drive down to Mesa 

Saves the employees a lot of time but now I have to drive down to Mesa Burger or over to Home Plate across the freeway. Sad because this is right in the neighborhood."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"It really was not for me, I heard great things from my brother that lives nearby but I think it mainly had to do with accessibility to a burger spot + Mexican food options put together so it works for conveniency however I just missed the flavor on my food along with the other options my party ordered.
I would stray from the carne asada fries it's a very small order and you have to pay/order condiments like sour cream and guacamole separate so it's not comparable to cucas, etc joints.
the ice cream on the other hand was pretty good it was soft serve classic however I literally checked in and tried to redeem my free cone and the cashier was anti doing it lol but they're about a $1.00 so I told him to ring me up for one for each of us and he could keep the extra dollar it was so awkward the deal he made out of - he may have not been the one to add the check in perk but he does work there so he could oblige to it"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"BEST HIDDEN LOCAL BURGER SPOT. For over 10 years, I have been coming here! Perfect place to come after surfing/swimming/craving a good a** burger! 

Best:
The delicious burger ofcourse with cheese and avocado !!

The good:
Presentation isn't the best but it doesn't matter when the food is so delicious . Only the locals really now about the secret spot 

The bad:
The fries are cooked fresh but just need additional salt.
It's a bit of a drive coming from downtown, only has one location; however very much worth the drive! They NEED to open another location!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"This is one of the best ""hidden"" burger joints in Goleta, hands-down. 

I've been coming here ever since I can remember. The restaurant changed hands recently, but the food is as good as ever. 

There are a lot of goodies in addition to the standard burgers (which are amazing, by the way). I'm partial toward their fish tacos, which I believe are made with thresher shark! They are loaded high with toppings and taste as heavenly as they look. 

I do know that Cal Taco recently started serving beer again. You can't go wrong with a $4 pint of Hoppy Poppy to accompany their tasty food. I'm also a fan of their pineapple milkshake, though it's sometimes a bit too milky for my taste.

Service is usually pretty prompt and friendly. They operate with an older POS system, but that doesn't affect the time spent at the register. 

The dining room is clean and hasn't changed since the '90s. There's also a nice front patio. Personally, I'd recommend placing your order to-go and driving a few short blocks to Haskell's beach. 

If you're a fan of The Habit, you'll see that the burgers and fries are rather similar. Definitely give this great spot a try if you're in Goleta and looking for a juicy burger to indulge!"
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,Been coming here for about 4 years. The vibe it used to have in the good ol' days is gone but the food is still pleasing. I recommend the turkey burger and their tri-tip sandwich.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Cal Taco has always been a mystical place for me. My first memory of Cal Taco was my coworker raving about how the best burger was at Cal Taco. I thought that was strange because it's called Cal Taco. For awhile I spoke of Cal Taco as a wonderful hope for a good burger. 

My best friend and I finally descended on Cal Taco one day and discovered the burger was in fact not the best and the tacos were average at best. I later would meet the original owner in Santa Maria, the name coming up again 70 miles away made me curious again. Were my expectations too high? 

Living in Goleta now, I thought it would be good to try Cal Taco. I wanted breakfast and a burger. Decent breakfast burrito but one could do far better in Goleta/Santa Barbara. Fried zucchini is 2/5. The burger was much better than I remember but it's definitely like average too. It's actually Habit burger! Habit burger is served here! The two are indistinguishable. 

Not a bad place to eat overall, they have some good deals. Cherry Coke too."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Came in for a breakfast burrito. Never got to find out how it tastes. The guy working the counter finished taking an order for the woman ahead of me, then, as I approached him, spent over a minute just poking at the register and the POS system. No greeting, no ""Hi, one second please."" At one point he printed a receipt from the register, slowly walked somewhere else, wrote something on the receipt, set down the receipt, slowly walked back, and continued poking at the register. I waited another 30 seconds. He continued showing me the top of his head. I left and went to Starbucks.

Weird vibes at this place."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"The burgers looked better than the Mexican food. Asked if they had crispy tacos. They said yes. Asked about the chicken.. is it shredded? Yes, they said. I received a soggy taco shell that you get at the store with cubed chicken meat. Five grains of rice sized cheese. 

They would not permit me use of their bathroom. The liquor store let me in theirs. I give the liquor store five stars. 

Best part of Cal Taco was the Diet Coke from the fountain. Not a good taco Tuesday:( heading to Rudy's now."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Nothing fancy, but adobado burrito and tacos are on point! Decent price, big portions."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Boy has this place gone down hill . They are not friendly, the prices have gone way up, food is just ok, and the people dress like they are going out to a nightclub. It's so strange. I miss the old owners and staff."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"The access card deal says ""any char burger"", but apparently this does not apply to double char burgers?  That is confusing, considering it says ""any"" char burger, and there are only two options: char and double char."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Some people bring sandwiches to the beach, but smart people bring burritos. Here's why. Swimming in the ocean builds up an appetite like no other. Burritos fill the belly, and they come in a neat little wrapped-up package. Bing! Bam! Boom!
Needless to say, this is our spot when going to the beach. I typically order a vegetarian burrito for myself, a chicken burrito for my husband and a bean cheese n rice burrito for my daughter. They offer chips n salsa for all orders, so that's an added bonus since so many others are charging for what use to be complimentary chips n salsa. 
Way to go, Cal Taco. We heart you. See you next beach day."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"Great breakfast burrito. Excellent burgers. I found this place on my own via Yelp, but then my Dad confirmed he's been eating at Cal Taco with guys from his work for years. If Goleta engineers eat here, you know the food is good and, more importantly, well-priced."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,What Evan B. said about the potatoes was actually my idea.
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Was a great place before they added hair to their food. Was extremely grossed out and disappointed especially bragging to guest about this being a local favorite. First they started skimping on their ingredients like one slice of a tomato and a pinch of sprouts on my turkey burger and thank god they did cause I had to
Open my burger and so did my company to add mustard ketchup etc and we both discovered a strain of hair in each of our burgers!! How likely is that first of all let alone disgusting. Won't be going back. Sorry for this review but it's unacceptable."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Coffee was good and service was friendly and quick.. Sadly can't say the same for anything else. Although the price was affordable we soon realized why. We got served the most bizarre excuse for ""hash browns"" I've ever seen. They were watery almost like a flavorless mashed potato and covered in cold cheese. The egg was dry and half way through I got a raunchy bite of them which tasted of fish. Sausages left a lot to be desired tasting like the variety from a hotel continental breakfast. Best part of the actual food was probably the warmed tortillas. Needless to say I won't be back and I'm pretty confused about all the good reviews."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"What happened here?!

I walked in to blaring Mexican music and a totally different vibe. The burgers were the same but the attitude has changed. What happened to the owner and the sweet girl that were always here with a smile? They were really great and are sorely missed."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"If you like the spot in Carpinteria you'll like this place for burgers. Even though it has taco in its name people come here for the burgers. I like how they give a good amount of veggies and raw onions on the burger. You can chose to get a add your choice of American, cheddar, or Jack cheese. The burger is delicious. The fried here are fatter than McDonald's or other fast food so it has nice texture when you take your food to go back to SB. I like how the employee provided some suggestions when I asked what was good.  I was recommended carnitas nachos but I opted for chicken. I wish I grabbed some salsa from the salsa bar.... bit the nachos came with one sour cream and one guacamole container. The nachos were a little salty compared to what I normally eat but I'm the flavor was good and had a nice lemon/lime flavor to the chicken. If you come by...I recommend trying out the burgers and maybe a pitcher of beer- I would have ordered it, but don't think they do it to go."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,negative,"Being a Mexican food maniac and having a partner who much prefers American food, I really enjoyed the concept of this place. In my opinion, the number one way to assess a Mexican restaurant is by the chips and salsa. Well, the chips aren't free and the salsa is a little too bland for my taste. The Mexican options are also very limited. The saving grace to this shack is the $2 charburger days and the free drinks for students (but don't even think about combining those specials, it won't work). Overall, an okay place."
VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg,Cal Taco,Mexican,positive,"I don't know why I never tried this place when I was living in Goleta. It's SO yummylicious!

Stopped here with some friends on our way out for a night of drinking and split a steak quesadilla with one of my girls. So good I wolfed every bite down! 

I was thoroughly satisfied with my dinner and will be dining here again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"First time eating here today, was fantastic! The food was great but the REAL REASON to go is view and ambience. Sitting outside right on the beach, enjoying your meal while listening to the soothing sound of waves crashing is simply sublime. Another plus, they sell beer! Lol. A must if you're in the area, even if you're not it's worth the drive. I'll definitely be back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Phenomenal place to eat. I has the Hickory burger, that was so damn delicious!! Will be coming back for sure!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food lacked flavor, but everything else was great. The presentation is near perfect and the location/decor are spot on."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Quick service, yummy food, and a sweet view! You can't beat this place. A total local gem!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a find! Great food, reasonable prices and great atmosphere. I had the fish tacos, though I wish I would have ordered the shrimp one's after I took a bite of my husband's. I got a side order of the battered green beans. They were suppose to be spicy, but I was told they didn't make them spicy that particular day. Well, okay then. I ordered them anyways and I was so glad that I wasn't deterred by the fact that they weren't spicy because they were the most lightly battered, perfectly crunchy, and delicious green beans I have ever tasted. To top it off, the beautiful Santa Barbara County day made the outdoor ambiance the most perfect date for my husband and I."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is in a great and fun location and you can't beat the beautiful beachfront view. It's family friendly and has a surprisingly tasty array of scrumptious food and drink. The burgers are my fave and they also have excellent sandwiches, onion rings and shakes. 
Add to that a nice selection of cold beer and all at reasonable prices. Oh yes, the employees are always quite nice. If you are in the area and hunger strikes I recommended giving the Beach Grill a try."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We had lunch here on 12/20. Maui burger was flavorful, juicy and thick. Choc. shakes very good and thick. Calamari had good flavor, really good with lemon squeezed on. Fish & chips was great, very tender and flavorful. All & all, we really enjoyed our stop here!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"When you walk in you go up to the counter to order, you are given a buzzer to let you know when you order is ready to go back up and get your food. After ordering you grab your cups and go get your drinks. Now your adventure begins, stroll out to the back of the property and you're greeted with an awesome ocean view. As others have said there is a great big sandbox with toys for kids to play but the best part is the great ocean view and atmosphere for the adults. We had the grilled fish & shrimp tacos. They were good - everything was very fresh.  Tacos come with a large side of fresh made tortilla chips & pico de gallo. Will definitely come back and try other items."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A truly unique and lovely find.  Green grass, a sandbox for kids, train tracks with the Amtrack Surfrider streaming past, and ocean view just past the rocks.  Usually, places with great views & ambiance have sucky food- this is NOT the case here.  Great burgers, medium rare, and the shakes (choco fudge, caramel, Oreo) are too delicious!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"As other have said, Great food, Great outdoor dining area, and decent prices.
I love Carpinteria, and we have been eating here for some time.... sometimes for both lunch and dinner. 
They also have some great beer on tap.

So why not a 5 star rating?

No Dogs allowed.

Have you considered allowing pets in a certain area at least?"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fun place to watch a sunset. It's like a picnic with out the basket! Great mix of locals and travelers. The lack of a dessert menu beyond the soft serve ice cream variations cost that 5th star. The fare is fair, the location makes up for it."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We have always been a fan of this restaurant. We come here every summer when we are here. Our previous visit was a disaster, but the owner made an effort to reach out to us and have us come back since they were in a stage of transition. On this visit the food was great the service was wonderful and the atmosphere is definitely very upbeat and obviously very popular with a lot of other people now. My wife and I had fish tacos and shrimp tacos, and they were great. Once again, this has become a summer favorite."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Super Fun place that we happened on by chance during our weekend child free get-a-way.  This place made me wish I had brought my kids along.  It is a great family spot with really amazingly good food!  We will be back!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great location when the weather is good. Food was great and came out fast. The tacos looked tempting, but i had the pretzel burger and it was really good. They executed well - we will be back."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Amazing place! Great for kids and there is a sandbox they can play at. People were nice the nachos w chili were good . Mostly the atmosphere fire pit and seats by the ocean were our favorite
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Very fun place. You wait in line and place your order and then pick it up when your restaurant pager buzzes. While you're waiting, go find a seat outside at one of the picnic tables all the way in the back and cross your fingers that the train will come by! This place is clearly a favorite for families with the huge sand pit and expansive lawn, so be prepared to dodge lots of small children running around.

We really wanted the ahi tuna sandwich but they didn't have any tuna (weird), so we got California burgers and they were great. The chocolate fudge shake was awesome too."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Recently had rehearsal lunch and reserved the Tiki Oasis section.  Food and service were excellent!  Will be sure to plan on having any future events here.  Beautiful location as well.  Thanks Will.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place was awesome! Scenery is beautiful, outside dining is nice, and food was great!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Visited today for lunch and it was pretty yummy. The restaurant is located right by the beach so parking can be an issue, but luckily we found a spot right away. I had the Hickory Burger, and my boyfriend had the grilled chicken sandwich. The prices are fair  (it was $28 for the two of us). There is a wonderful seating area which makes you feel like you're in a friends backyard. There is also a great play area for kids. Definitely worth a visit!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"5 stars for location (right next to the ocean) atmosphere (picnic tables with umbrellas, greenery, flowers), fantastic place for families (sandpit for the kids to play). 3 stars for food, we ordered calamari (smaller portion with a $10 price tag), fish tacos (comes with 2 tacos and a TON of tortilla chips/filler) fish and chips (3 good sized pieces of fish and a heaping pile of fries that needed seasoning) and Cali burger (okay)...what really made this place was the atmosphere. My kids played in the sand, then ate some food and then played in the sand again...they loved it which made me happy. Food was okay, but we'll be back because we had a good time. Going to try other things on the menu next time."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Not knowing Carpinteria at all, we yelped the best lunch and Padaro came up. We really liked it! The fish & chips and grilled fish tacos were great, very fresh, no fishy taste whatsoever. Great draft beer selection, too!  The cute beachy area for the kids to play is an awesome idea for those with little. The counter area faces the beach/ocean with various heights of the chairs for your perfect view. We highly recommend Padaro!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I always leave so happily full and fully happy.  I love introducing people to Padero's Beach Grill.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Perfect burger stop on our way home down the coast. Great family place with play areas for the kids.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"July 2015.  I have to say that I was very disappointed with our last visit.  They were out of so much food.  The basics for any kids meal, all of the fish items, no salads...  what is going on here? ??  The staff was very passive about the issue, and told us they only had the burgers available.  
The kids do love this place because if the play area,  and the picnic tables.  
I hope things are improved when we visit in a couple months."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a perfect location!

This place is so mellow and has the tastiest food + a beautiful outdoor seating area with views of the beach! 

You might expect a beachfront restaurant to be on the pricier side, however the prices here are solid and not expensive at all. THUMBS UP!

I could not have been happier with my dining experience. Best food + service! 

Padaro will surely become a frequent stop when cruisin' up the 101!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wow! What a cool place to hang out and enjoy a delicious lunch. You can't really tell from the outside how cool this place is but once you walk in the front door and see the huge counter with the menu in great view a top it's easy to order, pay and then go out to the picnic like area outside and wait till your buzzer calls you to pick up your tray. The tables are far enough away from each other that you really feel like you are enjoying an outdoor picnic. The hamburger I had was yummy. I was there for a meeting with 4 other people and everyone raved about the lunch choices. We could hear each other very well during our meeting and everyone had only good things to say about this place. The prices were reasonable, the staff came by a couple times to pick up trash. It was all good. I highly recommend it. Oh...there is indoor seating, in case you wondered."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Just love this place.  Great spot whenever going up or down the coast.  Great food, reasonable prices, healthy selections and great staff.  With outdoor seating and beach views it doesn't get much better."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place, whenever we drive up North we have to stop and eat here. We have a one year old and it makes for the perfect family friendly place to eat! Its great to go for a walk on the beach after eating too! They've recently re-modeled  and it looks beautiful, the only reason that I gave it one less star is because their menu used to be much more extensive and they had an amazing pizza. But since (I think it's under new owners, The Hook?) their menu has changed a bit, but still delish!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Always good food, great views and a relaxed environment. Definitely worth the wait when they're busy and by far the best burger in Carpinteria."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This is a great place to take the family. My son loved the sand box and the fact that he can run around. The only down side is parking and be sure not to park in other businesses spots or you'll get towed. The line to order is out the door. Definitely  worth going.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,It is a great location for families with young children.  Less amazing for people without young children although it is still a lovely location.  The food is okay but pedestrian.  Quite fine for young palates of any age.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Chill place to stop and grab a bite after being on the motorcycles in the canyons all morning.  Great outdoor seating.  Everyone seemed to LOVE the sweet potato fries!  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for lunch but the staff was friendly and the food was decent.  The salad was just average.  Next time I think I would try the BBQ place next door!  Parking sucks on a Sunny Sunday afternoon!

There is a sandbox for all the kiddies... perhaps why I knocked them down a star... 

Great view!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I have been coming here on and off for years and was excited to see how the owners of the Hook chain would do with a historically great place, wow was I disappointed. ... .....meh. Those guys should come and taste the food, nothing like the Hook chain, I would be embarrassed to put my name on this place after founding high quality places like Hook and The Habit.

There is some good. Great location, patio, places for kids to play, great vibe. Decent selection of tap beer. Too bad they had to serve food here. (at least what we had)

We both had Baja Fish Tacos. Non descript sauce,  fish smelled like they did not clean out the fryer, cabbage was flat, no other quality ingredients or flavors that came through. The salsa was watery no flavor, no onion or cilantro or pepper flavor, really really poor quality. After eating these fish tacos you really appreciate Spencer Mackenzie's in Ventura. 

We also had Cole slaw and it tasted like a pile of poor quality cabbage. No sauce or other flavors. I actually took it back and asked if they forgot to mix in anything with the slaw. Even after they ""fixed it"" it was horrible. 

I understand they have the Hook hamburgers here so will give it another shot one of these days."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I cannot believe I have lived in SB as long as I have and have NEVER been here.

- Huge lawn area with ocean view
-gorgeous atmosphere, feels like you are in Hawaii
-you walk in and think its a higher end place and it is a simple burger joint! LOVED THIS!

I recommend:
-Tuna Melt ( OMMMMGGGGGG!! Amazing!)
-sweet potato fries 
- hawaiian burger


YUM YUM YUM!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Came for dinner on a slow night. Manager gal was super rude. Just not friendly at all and seemed put out to answer some questions. Once home we both had horrible stomach aches. Location is beautiful but the meal and service not so good...
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is so great for families... You actually get to eat with your significant other while your kids play in a sand pit... That is worth every penny spent! You might actually get to eat your food hot too!

The food was ok... Typical burger joint, nothing fantastic but nothing bad either.

But you really come here because its on the beach, kids can play and run around, you can sit and actually eat your food, and enjoy the view!

It will always be a stop for us when in the area!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The hubby and I had the CA burger and the teriyaki burger with a side of fries. Lots of kids there today - they have a nice little sand area for kids to play. They have lots of picnic tables to sit at and an adult only section that is raised about the grass area. Pretty good burgers. This is the second time we've been there and we think there burgers are slightly better than average. Not sure if we'd return for a third time. Parking was a bit hard to find.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Terrible. I know padero beach is suppose to be gauche and all but this place just seems so low brow even for a beach restaurant. The worst part is the fact that the young, entitled snotty teens that come in there are absolutely vile. My friend and I who were in line and literally were rudely and dismissively cut in front of by about 10 different teens. We went from being third in line to 12th! Not a glance from these little shits or acknowledgment. Honestly it was the rudest shit my grown ass has experienced in a LONG TIME. I'm used to Malibu and the Palisades. We dress beachy, w flip flops, carefree, nothing to prove bc the proof is in the pudding. No one behind the counter said anything about it either. I promptly changed my mind about even spending one dollar in this hell hole. We just bought a property down the way on the private strip of padero beach and I can promise you, myself nor any of my visiting guests will step foot in this place. I'm so disgusted with the behavior by customers and lack of awareness by staff."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We happened to be driving up to Santa Barbara from LA and knew we wanted to stop along the way.  We wanted something new & different from our typical spots in Carp and also desired the ocean view, if possible.  I wasn't in the mood for something TOO big, but the husband did want something filling... YELP TO THE RESCUE!  We found Padaro Beach Grill and the reviews immediately made me want to go.  

LOCATION/PARKING:  I gave the hubby directions, which seemed easy enough off the freeway.  As we approached it, we noticed TONS of cars along the side of the road with lots of people walking.  For a Saturday in November, this worried us... but the weather was fabulous, so we hoped they were all just going to the beach.  Probably were, b/c we found a spot RIGHT IN FRONT... Score!  

FOOD/DRINK:  They've got some beers on tap, so the husband enjoyed a brewsky.  They also have wines by the glass or bottle, so I enjoyed a nice white wine (sauvignon blanc) since it was fairly warm and sunny.  We were both satisfied with the liquids, though neither were ones we were raving about.  The food, on the other hand, was exactly what we both desired.  The husband enjoyed the hickory burger, which seemed to be a fave from reviews already.  I got ONE bite and enjoyed it thoroughly, but it was all gone before I could even ask for the 2nd.  HAH.  As I desired, I did get a salad... the BBQ Chicken Salad.  So, although it wasn't exactly your healthiest, it tasted fresh and I truly enjoyed the way they made it and ate more than half, and couldn't stop picking until I was literally feeling too full to eat one more bite. (I'm lucky if I eat  1/2 of anything b/c I just tend to have a small appetite.)  We also enjoyed some fries (or I had 2-3 and he enjoyed a basket).  

SERVICE:  You pay upon entrance, so there was a little line.  Then they give you a buzzer to take with you that is actually quite funny when it goes off.  ""Please go to the counter.  Your food is ready."" Or something like that.  My husband got the food and I waited, so I can't say how they were when he got it, but he didn't have any complaints.

AMBIANCE:  After you pay for your food, you exit the building onto a patio with a few tables.  Then you proceed into a grassy, island/luau-type feeling area.  There are some tables here throughout the grass or you could proceed further over a bride.  Instead of a pond as you go over the bridge, there is a sandbox with kids playing in it.  (Only complaint on this is the kids who are making dust as people walk by with their trays of food.)  After going over the bridge, there are more picnic tables (would definitely work for large groups) in grass, an ADULTS ONLY bricked patio to the left, and a stage to the right.  Condiments are available also next to the picnic tables and bridge and I noticed a BBQ that would be awesome on warm sunny days; it made me wonder if they have events or if they do private parties should someone want to rent it out.  (It looks like a PERFECT area for a wedding or a big special bday bash.)  The best part of this all is that there is an OCEAN VIEW.  On the other side of the picnic tables are some bushes, the train tracks (I'll mention later), and then the beach!  I L-O-V-E the beach, hence the reason we were in S.B. & Carp, so this was exactly what we were looking for!  Now, as I said I'd mention, I do want to give you the heads up that the train does go by (as it does throughout Carp and S.B. anyway), so if you can prepare for it... do so.  (Otherwise, you jump up like you're getting mugged when the train suddenly goes by like I did, haha.)  Also, although there is a lot of space, there was not nearly as many people as the place could fill.  Mind you it was November, but from what I've read, it seems it is still a casual spot and I sure hope it stays that way!  Oh and I must mention that yes there are birds, so watch your food.  There are also rabbits too!

BOTTOM LINE:  Enjoying good food and a glass of wine/beer on an adults only patio overlooking the ocean... We have definitely found our new lunch spot in S.B./Carp!  I highly recommend this place if you're driving through, are a local, or just want a nice destination spot to get away to!  Next time, we'll have to make a day of it and walk to the beach after. =)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My friend was in the mood for a burger after getting back from her trip to Puerto Rico so we decided to make the drive up here. She had been wanting and wanting to eat here so I'm glad we made the trip. The food is good but I can get the same food at their sister location, Hook, in Oxnard. You can't beat the location and vibe though. It's worth the drive."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I was very impressed with this local food hub.  My fiancé and I were staying the night in Carpinteria for our Valentine's Day weekend, and I wanted to make sure that I took him to a scenic and delicious spot for dinner. After scouring Yelp for places with good reviews, I finally decided on this little place. I was so pleasantly surprised not only with quality in food, but also the friendly staff and ambiance.  This location is definitely the perfect place for a cute date night or even family event. The seating area gives you the option of porch seating with cozy chairs and heaters, or outdoor seating with picnic tables and a really cute grassy layout. The food was amazing and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something new!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wow, I've been hearing a lot about this place and I'm happy I finally did decide to stop in. It was super busy for a Wednesday night but it was so so yummy. Definitely worth the wait. The fish tacos were delicious, you won't be disappointed!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Meh...food is ok...can barely see any ocean, even if you are standing.  Skip it."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Hands. Down. FIVE. Stars!  This is the best little place off the road right on the beach Mature Palms in the garden courtyard give just the right amount of shade. Every plate I ever had was great- totally going to go here every time I'm in town!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The best turkey sandwich I ever had on a brioche bun!!! And their Oreo chocolate fudge shake was amazing and a beautiful view!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I have two small kids and family that lives in Ventura, so the Padaro is a regular meeting place to let the kids play in the sandbox while we enjoy a good burger and local craft brew.  I've been once since the new ownership and it still seems just as good as before.  I wouldn't stray too far from burgers and salads, those are good but mixed reviews on some of the seafood.  Beer is good, and did I mention the kids entertain themselves in the sandbox so you can enjoy an adult conversation?"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"*Amendment to my review:  The owner of the Padaro Beach Grill contacted me regarding my review. He was VERY polite and basically offered to rectify our negative dining experience. I am very impressed with his level of professionalism and customer service. I give the restaurant FIVE stars in this area and hope my next experience will be better and my overall rating will change also! My current rating is just for our one experience and the food we received that time. 

Well, my husband and I were hoping for great things at the new Padaro Beach Grill. Frankly, it was the same old Padaro; over-priced and mediocre food! By the time you order a burger and add everything on it, which is $.75 extra for EACH side, plus order your fries, which are also separate, you've spent over $11.00! The food is ok, but my fish and chips were quite greasy and not worth the price! The one plus, they cut down the hedge so there is an ocean view now. Think I'll skip it and go into SB for a great burger or fish and chips with a view of the ocean at a better price!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,OMG people with their pathetically loud screaming kids make it impossible to enjoy this place!!!  BE CONSIDERATE OF OTHERS YOU SELF ABSORBED IDIOTS!!!!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The Padaro Beach Grill gets 5 stars because it is now exactly what it should be--affordable decent burgers and sandwiches in a great clean outdoor setting.  Although I visited the old grill a few times I can't say I was a fan of the ridiculously overpriced crummy food, however I will now make this a regular destination.The food is actually good as is the service; they upgraded the inside and outdoor area making it much cleaner; and they were smart enough to keep the one thing worth keeping: the sandbox."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Finally a solution to the seagulls.  Great place to spend Sunday afternoon with the family.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great place for a picnic! Beautiful view of the ocean. I love to come at sunset and enjoy a great dinner. The food is high quality fast food!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good hamburgers and a great place to bring kids. Had the roasted chili burger one night, and the California burger another, and both were very good. The onion rings were fantastic, but I could have passed on the fries. It can definitely be a cluster f here, but the food is really good so I would definitely come back."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Ate here tonight! Awesome location, not so much on the food- I am currently in the bathroom with food poisoning thanks to the fish and chips. Knew I shouldn't have eaten the fish when I tore it open and it was 1/2 dark grey meat. Lesson learned on my end. Check your fish quality, mates!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Drove out of our way to come to this place because we remembered it being pet friendly before and after searching for a parking spot for over 15 minutes we walk in and are informed that they are no longer allowing dogs unless they are service animals.  Pet owners beware...don't waste your time unless your dog is certified as a service animal.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I went in July 2016 with my family. They ordered sandwiches which were okay, no rave. One salad order wrong. I ordered a chicken quesadilla. Horrible. I had to hunt for the few pieces of chicken and they used a yellow cheese, not real sure but I think cheddar. Clumpy and cold. And no ocean view. Parked WAY down the road so forget handicap or elderly. There was a tiki bar that had 'stay out' yellow tape and a sign warning 'no kids'. Of course children kept going in and one of my party rescued them until the parents noticed. Poor way to insure customer safety."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great burger! I had the bbq burger which had tons of flavor. Burger comes by itself, so don't forget to add an order of fries. Great location!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,The food is mediocre. Nothing special. The outdoor seating is nice when it's not cold.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Ok...... ALL DELISH! We had the fish and chips that were seasoned and battered just right. The fish tacos were as well perfect. Even the chicken sandwich was done right! The tuna sandwich was delish!
The outside garden with the ocean and beach view is breathe taking! Sandy play area for kids and adult area with firepit!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is by far my favorite place for amazing tacos and sunset watching in the area! High quality food, huge portions, delicious fresh fish and excellent ambience. Family friendly, also perfect for romantic occasions! Love, love, love!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food, even better atmosphere. Make sure you get a nice coast-side table outside."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place can be perfect. You have to just go for the right reasons. Family and kids this is perfect. Ocean view, burgers, drinks and place for kids to play and have fun. Where you finding that, here. But this place is not just for the Fam. Go at Sunset, get a Draft or glass of wine and ask the manager to turn on the fire pit a level up and away from the kids and kick back. Good eats, drinks, and a view to cherish with good friends. Love this place, we've been going here years. Enjoy."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Your expectations should be that you are going to order food, wait for it to be prepared, carry it to a bench and eat it outside.  If you have an expectation that you will be served, or in a place that is quiet - this isn't your place.  BUT if you want a really relaxing, nice and fun experience - this is one of the best places we have been to in the Carp area.  I almost always get the same thing, Fish and Chips, my family get different things - burgers and sandwiches.  They like it and never say that their meal wasn't good.

Lots of young families - really worth a visit!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great family friendly spot! Huge sandbox and lots of space for the kids to run around. Train passes right by as you eat. Food is good (owned by Hook Burger folks). Nice selection of beer and wine. Just watch out, the seagulls are really aggressive!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The only thing great about this place is the fact its on the beach. The food was not great. My kids had some fish and chips, the wife had a chicken sandwich and i had a hamburger. Personally i thought my food was plain it was lacking the wow factor, in short this is how i would describe it frozen food plain. The wife and the kids did like their food, why because they were hungry"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This is my favorite place to have seafood the calamari there is mind blowing and the staff is great! I would recommend anyone to go there . The view is exceptional and pairing it with a hoppy poppy is a good way to go
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Always spot on!  I bring out of town guests here and they love the food and the view.  The prices are great,  portions are large and the staff is friendly and efficient.  You won't be disappointed!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Delicious!  Not sure what the bad reviews are about, but I thought the prices were pretty decent.  You can get a plain burger (Prime) for under $6, and my California burger had roasted red peppers, red onions, and avocados on it for under $8.  Hubby got a huge Cobb salad with a ton of chicken and avocados for under $9.  Then we split an order of sweet potato fries that were HUGE, toasty, and yummy.  The kid got chicken tenders for under $5 with a side of applesauce and Horizon organic white milk in a cup.  She did not like her chicken tenders, so we ate them for her.  They were good!  More like fat chicken balls, tender and juicy inside.  

I don't think I even need to talk too much about the location, landscaping, and how child friendly this place is.

Perfect for families!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place is amazing.. Very relaxing and my daughter loved it she made friends there while we enjoyed the view... and good food.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Delicious Food!!  FIVE Stars!!  
Vibe = FIVE Stars!
Service = FIVE Stars!
Atmosphere = Five stars!!

Need more restrooms - otherwise, this place is FABand a FIVE Star establishment!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"No Dogs allowed. They have not been allowed for a couple of years now. No longer real reusable plates either.  The new deck area with a fire pit for warmth is for adults only and the indoor eating is tiny. We all still like it - a great place to catch a bite with the family, but thought you should know in case the things I mentioned matter."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Hickory burger! The food was good, but it gets four stars because the location adds to the experience. There's a seating area right outside with a little view of the beach, convenient to walk to from the beach, may have some trouble parking there."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wow,  I loved it!  I had the California burger..fabulous!!!, a plate of nachos..mmmmmmmmm,  sweet potato fries..yum..i know, too much food!!!!!..but I persevered and ate almost every bite.  Even though it's a ""serve yourself"" eatery, the staff was attentive when I appeared at the ""wine window"", super nice as I was getting my order.  I loved sitting under the umbrella and seeing the ocean..and now a better view from the new raised patio..Kids in the sandbox were cute, grounds were immaculate,will be going back soon."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"3/5 stars for poor service.  The food is relatively good especially the chicken.  Chicken sandwich and chicken salads are damn good. Unfortunately at night the place seems to be run by kids.  They never answer phone orders and typically get your order wrong.  Also much slower at night to get food out than during the day.  If you aren't going to take orders or care about your customers at night just close down after lunch.

3.2/5 stars. My brother says try the chopped cobb salad."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place to stop while driving up the Pacific Coast Highway! Food was great-fish tacos, salad, burger & fries pleased those in our party. The huge sandy area for the kids to play in while waiting for our order (which didn't take long) and after eating was  a fun activity while the adults relaxed and enjoyed the ocean view & the outdoor eating space. Highly recommend!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place was so cool. I loved it. They had a nice menu with some food that was surprisingly very tasty. The thing that was nice was that it was right up next to the ocean. They have a large area outside to set and eat, it might even be a small park. However, the thing that was neat was as you sat and enjoyed your lunch, you could let the kids play in the park that was within shouting distance. A great place with good food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great burgers and beer right on the beach. A $10 mil view of the sunset with a  Huge grass patio and sandbox to distract the kids, while you enjoy a pint from a Good selection of draft beers.  An excellent place to chill! Recommend the California burger."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I stopped here on a beautiful day to enjoy an outdoor lunch.   Once I had my food, I realized I had forgotten napkins.  When I returned to my picnic table, gulls had devoured my fish tacos!  I was stupid to leave the food unattended, and I sheepishly brought my tray back to the counter.  The person in charge replaced my lunch for free!  I am so grateful I am writing this review as a thanks.  Food is not gourmet, but they serve perfect outdoor by-the-ocean fish shack type food, and it tasted wonderful."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The only reason I'm giving it any stars is because the location is beautiful, the setup is family friendly and the staff is great but the food is crap.  Frozen and out of the box is exactly what you can expect from this place. I ordered fish tacos and the tortilla was practically Raw and cracked while I ate it, had no flavor and was mostly lettuce. Thankfully they were willing to give me a full refund and offer something on the house. We declined. 

If you must go order basic stuff like onion rings and salads- it's hard to see those up"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a convenient place off the 101 to stop to enjoy good food.  Definitely a big fan of the onion rings.  I love the open picnic seating garden area, sand area for the kids, adult area and ocean area.  The shrimp & avocado salad is good but I don't think it's worth the $11.  6 shrimp, qtr of an avocado and salad.  Maybe the salad is organic! I gave it four stars only because is literally right off the freeway and the noise of all the cars that pass by does not make it relaxing."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We spent the day at the beach next this place and went in for dinner afterwards. Great burgers! Got the pretzel burger and the wife for the prime burger with blue cheese. Both were excellent as were the sweet potato fries. Plus the outside doing area can't be beat. I've been told that the shakes are amazing as well but we didn't get them this time.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Wow....don't know where these other reviewers ate, but not here....  3 of us had lunch, vegeburger, baja fish tacos and regular fish tacos.   Burger was terribly dry, tacos were tiny and had on little (tiny) piece of fish that was hidden under a bunch of cabbage.  Smallest $9.25 tacos possible and total fish weight could  not have been 2 oz.  Cute place, but very poor value"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Decent food and a great place to meet up with little ones in tow. The atmosphere is super relaxed (picnic type) and is generally very busy on the weekends. Kids like the open play area with sand pits, the train near by, and freedom to run around in a safe environment."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome if you got kids, there's a nice size sandbox area they can play in while you enjoy your food and beer.  The menu has a good selection from tasty looking burgers to variety of seafood dishes.   Nice outside seating area with lots of room around you. Great place to gather with friends.  I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy and loved it!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place was good a year ago, but now it's just perfect!  Enjoy a sunset, some wine, and two orders of fish tacos while the sun sets on the pacific.  If the weather's not as good, sitting inside is nice, and there's a TV for sports."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Way better then before. The service is fantastic. The updated patio is great, especially with the elevated area so you can actually see over the hedges is a great idea. The food is way better now. Albacore sandwich is my fav. Island Brew on tap, big plus. The fish portion on the fish and chips are the best I've had in the area. The kicker is, it's not over priced. So the service, food and price is better than the old Padaro Grill. Restaurateurs take notice! 

Parking and crowd is a problem on the weekend but what do you expect, it's on Padaro. :)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Found this great spot for a Saturday afternoon. Free parking on street. Located in an area with some shops and a wedding venue right past Carpinteria. You order at the front counter then find a seat outside. It's a big space next to the ocean. Family and kid friendly but there's also an adult only section. The Amtrak also passes by. The food was great. We ordered the regular Prime burger, Cali club and trio fries with beer. We enjoyed everything we ate while sitting looking out to the ocean. Will definitely come back."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food is 4 stars and the outdoor setting is 5 stars.  Definitely the place to go if you have kids and/or don't mind the presence of kids.  The menu is quite standard: burgers, fries, tacos, fish and chips, reasonable selection of good beer, reasonable selection of alternative drinks.  The food was really solid.  There are a few reviews stating that the food is quite standard, but really, I don't think that this place is trying to pass itself off as anything fancy.  It's just good regular food!  I got fish and chips and my husband got the burger, both were quite decent and tasty.  The staff was very helpful and nice.  The best part was the setting, right next to the beach.  They have a beautiful lawn that is completely enclosed by fence or hedge that is nicely decorated and includes a little pond.  The Amtrak runs by and is surprisingly entertaining.  We have a toddler so it was the perfect place for her to run around and play in the sand pit with other children.  The picnic tables are especially nice for sharing with strangers but there are plenty that you wouldn't need to.  The good food plus the beautiful and family friendly setting definitely puts this restaurant at the top of our list of places to eat."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great views, relaxing spot all American food. Caution, be prepared to fight seagulls for your leftovers"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"we were driving from Santa Barbara down to the Ventura area when suddenly wanted to eat something - pulled off on Santa Claus lane (yeah Santa likes the beach too I guess) and found a group of restaurants a BBQ place, a deli type market, and the beach grill - the BBQ place was closed, the partner in dine did not want the deli so we chose the burger place - Padaro Beach Grill

okay so the place has a great setting
sunny by the beach, great lawn area, (well during the summer anyway)
Good burgers, had the prime burger with cheddar/grilled onions/dijon
very good- lots of good beefy flavor
good sweet potato fries (is it me or is EVERY place doing them now? are they this decades blooming onion?) but I digress

you place your order at the counter and then the give you a buzzer to notify when your order is up
 
one thing that was a bit odd - they people who worked there were ALL YELLING ALL THE TIME!!!
we were sitting outside across the lawn and we could still hear them, if it is because of the music that is playing perhaps turn it down??"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food is ok, but as a mom with 4 kids this place is a dream. Perfect afternoon play date spot while sipping a milkshake or an ice tea. Perfect for summer dinners that last hours, while the kids play and parents sit and chat (in peace). Can't recommend this place enough for parents."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"AMAZING! FUN! and sooo YUMMY!
We were driving thru and stumbled upon this place and glad we did. The outdoor area is beautiful... like a little park. There was a play area for kids and shady, or sunny, picnic tables, whichever you prefer. We had a California burger & fish and chips, and they were both good. We did not order onion rings but man did they look good! next time for sure!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wow!  This will now be a regular stop for the family whenever we're driving through. Feels like you're at a friend's house, hanging out in their backyard for lunch.  Nice big open lawn, play area with sand pit for the kids, and a very relaxing feel.  Food wasn't great, but i don't think you're necessarily coming here for that.  Actually, it's probably nice that you don't have to pay $15 for a burger.... Just an easy relaxed spot to hang out and enjoy a quick meal."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"A wonderful view over the water in a nice garden setting. However, the two Fish & Chips we had were very disappointing. The batter was soggy and the fish - whatever it was - was tasteless. Go for the atmosphere but not for the food if ours was any indication."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Well, I took my wife,mother and 3 year old for lunch on Mother's Day. Super busy. Food was ok, not worth 46 bucks. No beer or wine, just coke, milk and shake. We had a burger, tuna melt, and ahi sandwich. My son had the chicken kids meal with fries. This is where it gets interesting. After he had finished his meal, I noticed something in the bottom of the ranch dressing that he had been dipping his fries and chicken . I found an old penny in the bottom of it. Gross!!! I brought it to the expeditor's attention without causing a scene and was offered a shake. I told him I had already bought one. He then walked away. Pretty sad for a higher end grill. I have had better customer service at Del Taco. Come on, it was my kid, at least offer a free kids meal to get me back. They could have comp'd the whole meal, with a line out the door all day, doubt it would have cut into their profit, but I would have been writing a different review that's for sure. I will never go back. For 50 bucks they just lost a customer and got a bad review. Not a smart business decision."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I loved the vibe of this spot. We grabbed a bottle of wine and some lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. You have to stand or sit at the high tables along the edge of the lawn area to see the ocean, but it's still a great setting for meeting up with friends. We were also lucky enough to see a pod of dolphins swimming by. A large group of the patrons gathered at the edge of the restaurant to watch. It is a relaxed feel and the food and wine were great!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Out of the way little place we found by luck (and my overwhelming hunger). Gem of a place. Kid & dog -friendly although you don't need either to enjoy the casual charm and the sandbox & green grass.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Charming atmosphere and great burgers.  I never knew it was there in all the years traveling through.  Def a family spot too.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Two thumbs up! Great place for young kids, food was good and beer was cold!
Coming back next year"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The food was not only delicious but a really nice family oriented area. We loved being able to eat and watch the ocean. We will be back!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Tasty food, great service, reasonable price, prime location right near the ocean (3 min walk to beach), casual ambiance for outdoor seating with light at night.

Padaro is known for their burgers, and they did not disappoint.  There is a wide selection, and our party got almost all of them (out of the chili burger, which is named for the pepper and not for the stew) and was very satisfied, no one talked for about 3 minutes straight.  If your burger comes with a sauce, like the 1000 Island or Chipotle Mayo, ask for extra sauce.  They put some on, but it is not sufficient to cover all bites, and the patties are thick and need more sauce to balance the taste.  The Veggie Burger is perhaps the best one I've had, with a balanced seasoning that does not try to assault your mouth.  Caramelized bourbon onions are as delicious as they sound, Maui burger has cubes of pineapple in the salsa, and the option to add bacon or avocado to any burger.  I will note that these cost (which is the opposite to what I was told when ordering, which I am assuming was a miscommunication rather than blatant lying).  The salads are plate sized and piled high, large enough to feed even the biggest diners. While the Trio of sides was talked up, only the Onion Rings lived up to the hype.  The sweet potato and regular potato fries were just normal fried potatoes.  Lastly, the strawberry shake is made with fresh strawberries, which you can tell from the chunks blended in the shake."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Looked for a recommended place as we were traveling through, and this one had great reviews.  Decided to stop and walked in at 732 on a Friday night and was told by someone they were closed already.  Another person walked in behind me and was told the same thing.  Well they should fix their website so that it reflects their hours of operation accurately! Besides what type of resturants closes at 730 on a Friday night."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I ordered the fish taco entrée and it was very tasty. The tacos were a good size with salsa that was flavorful. The restaurant was very busy so I had to wait a while to order, but the overall wait was acceptable. 

I would recommend eating here if you do not mind large crowds."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Very enjoyable little spot. Right on the water and they have a beach you can play at, I didn't play but my little girls did and had a great time! I enjoyed the burger I had and my wife really enjoyed the food. The staff was really cordial and treated my family with respect, I would definitely make my way back here when visiting my sis. :)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"How have we been to Carpinteria so many times, and driven by so many more, and never been to Padaro Beach Grill???  

I cannot recommend this place enough, especially as a place to go with kids.  The food was great and not very expensive for what you get (especially considering the location - more on that in a minute).  Everything was very fresh and seemed to be made from quality ingredients as well.  Everyone who worked there seemed very friendly and the food was out very fast too.

The real star of this place, though, is the location and the outdoor area.  Right next to the beach with a beautiful grassy area dotted with tables as well as a large sandbox for the kids and some very pretty water features.  It is also right next to the train tracks, which is a bit loud when a train goes by, but it was great for the kids as they loved watching it.

We will definitely be back and highly recommend it for anyone and everyone."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We visited Carpenteria to get some driftwood on the beach.  While visiting we were checking on Yelp where to have brunch.  It was a Sunday and two of the restaurants with high reviews were closed.  We went to another restaurant and did not like menu or vibes.  We ended up at Pass to Beach Grill and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was great and the atmosphere even better.  We will be returning soon and have recommended it to many people.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great outdoor eating area that is geared for a family style picnic with excellent food.  If you like the Habit or Hook Burger Bistro, you'll be in familiar territory with the selections.  The fish tacos were pretty nice, but a little more sauce would help them out.  My kids played in the park area for almost 45 minutes while my wife and I enjoyed the rest of our meals and the beautiful grounds.  If you're in Ventura and it's a nice day, drive up for lunch at this spacious outdoor venue."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"OH YES. Perfect place situated in the perfect place. Big and tasty and built to help your day at the beach (or your respite from the 101). I wandered over after surfing and, upon seeing a big line, took the advice of their friendly sign: Avoid The Line, and have some BBQ around the corner. Done. It all looked good, but I went with the Pulled Chicken Sandwich. Yes, chicken. And it totally worked. Nicely flavored with a bit of spice, the chicken meat sits upon the french roll. BBQ Sauce is good, though I'm glad I asked for it on the side. - cause that's just the kinda guy I am. 

It comes with baked beans (which have a mustardy kick to 'em), as well as a mixed green salad. The sandwich itself could easily be split, it's that big. All this for $12.95. 

The regular menu has salads and many more things that look good, plus some special beverages. Yes, you can have some adult bevs at the BBQ, but you'd be hard-pressed to get them to make you a delicious chocolate shake. To the regular menu for that.

There are so many places to sit. And there's a sand-area for the little ones to frolic. And on this Sunday, there was a Blues Band playing that seemed to know it's way around a Willie Dixon song or two. Totally good vibe for all ages."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Stopped here on our way home from Santa Barbara. Really good burgers & sandwiches here! The sweet potato fries & onion rings are to die for also. The outdoor seating is really spacious & has some ocean views. It's in a difficult location with scarce parking though. This place is totally worth a stop if you're in the area! We will def be coming back.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This is a great place for fish tacos and burgers. They have a decent beer select and even wine to enjoy. You get a ocean side view that you can sit and enjoy your Oreo Cookie shake with. Highly recommended.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"So perfect, particularly with kids in tow. Quick counter service, organic food, beer and wine on tap, picnic tables in beachside garden setting, complete with huge sand area and toys. Fellow parents of young children will appreciate how rare it is to actually relax during dinner! But the kids are fenced in and the food is delicious. Try the fish tacos!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This wonderful restaurant had the best of all worlds - great food, drinks, and an outdoor seating area to die for.  It was right on Padaro Beach and had a ton of picnic tables with umbrellas outside in the grass overlooking the ocean.  There were sand boxes for kids to play in, but there was also a separate adults only section.  The fish tacos were amazing and the beer was cold."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"(Dined 02/25/15 W @ 1:00pm): Settle in, kick off your flip-flops, dip your toes into the soft sand, and enjoy the scenery because you won't want to leave!

Thank goodness one of my friends along on this overnight trip to the Chumash Casino recommended Padaro Beach Grill as our first stop on our way up California's Gold Coast. The vibe alone sold me, but how was the grub!?:

Chocolate Caramel Handmade Shakes ($4.75) - Nearly a ""$5 shake"", this truly hit the spot in Southern California's warm winter weather. Not as thick as Jack-In-The-Box so my lungs were intact, this was a wonderful mixture of really good chocolate ice cream dolloped with a cloud of whipped cream all poured-over by sticky sweet caramel. Honestly, this would've sufficed as a meal, but I was eager to explore the food menu. The only ""negative"" was that you didn't receive a little extra shake in a mixing cannister like some places. But this was damn good! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=RX6qdpO3DOH4Z1USJMkTRg

[ONION RINGS/STRAWS/STRINGS ALERT - 4.0 of 5 STARS]
The Trio ($5.95) - A bountiful basket filled with French fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries with a collection of BBQ, catsup, and ranch dipping sauces, this also could've been a meal in itself for one. The French fries were crispy, slightly seasoned and skiny; I liked them. The sweet potato fries were more crunchy on the outside but moist and sweet on the inside; I LOVED sweet potato fries and these didn't disappoint (no sauce needed). You only received a few lovely dark golden brown and extra crunchy medium-sized onion rings which had plenty of extra ""nubs"" to chew on. The onion stayed intact when you bit into it and didn't pull out from its batter casing. I loved these but only wished you got more in this sampler. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=elJv_ZWjaTt237mrmdIq6g

Baja Shrimp Po' Boy ($9.50) - A two-hander for sure, this was filled with large pieces of crispy Cajun shrimp throughout, house made coleslaw, lettuce, Thousand Island dressing and chipotle mayo served on a toasted French roll. Oh boy, this was no shrimpy sandwich with its burst of flavors and finger-licking goodness! Multiple napkins needed. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=biMo9-Sdib2u9k--JXyw3A

Service - An ""order-at-the-counter-and-take-your-number"" kind of place http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=rqWaapJwF687nwmawzgJUw, we placed our orders, received our order numbers and drink cups, paid, found a table outside, and our numbers were called about ten minutes later. Once we were done, we threw our trash away (didn't appear to have any wait service but plenty of trash cans). All was easy-peasy with no hiccups. 

Parking (Free) - They shared a small elongated strip of private parking with a number of other businesses along a stretch of beach, so parking could be rough. Otherwise, distant street parking might be avialable. 

Atmosphere, décor, ambience - A casual beach shack along the Amtrak railway line and the beach in Santa Barbara http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=PKMgHmcMa3qEg-L2FbK3Bw with Adirondack chairs on the porch http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=Lt1uyS_7nbvfdBabLupKzQ, inside dining was at a minimum with a couple tables for four. However, it was all about the outside patio picnic bench and table dining area as you gazed out to the ocean and watched the train as they went by. There was even a sandlot for the kiddies http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=pcoKQePJRQFshFbH04scrg. Minimal decorations and pictures hung from the walls all with a beach theme. A chalk-written colorful menu was placed directly above the order counter. Natural lighting was everywhere while some electric track lighting was used (but why!?). There were a couple TVs while music played in the background http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=J8cjAfcPJNN4OiBS3cyU2A.

Attire - Totally casual, so I would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops.

Overall, I completely enjoyed Padaro Beach Grill with its amazing food, wonderful prices, and outstanding view (location...location...location). Maybe the beach bum in me was swept away by the scenery (it kind of was!), but this place truly had the whole package. The menu was simple, healthy, and offered that casual SoCal vibe. Although I didn't order any alcohol, their beer and wine selection may've been limited but the prices were standard to below-standard. Yeah, I'd definitely return next time I was in the area. I found total value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (total bill was around $22.00 before tip). And, they accepted my credit card of choice...AMEX! 5.0 STARS"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fun environment! Looks fancy from the outside but definitely more of a casual atmosphere. Sandboxes in the back for families with kids!

Burgers, chili, fries, and grilled cheese were all great! Only short walk from Santa Claus Beach if you need to walk off that shake you indulged in. Haha. No but really, good food and nice place to go with group of friends."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Padaro beach is a good spot near the beach with plenty of seating and a good vibe. Ambience alone scores a few stars - the fact that the food is delicious is totally unexpected. The salads are fresh and big, and the pretzel bun burger is amazing. 
Really really good food - a must stop when driving up to Santa Barbara."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Nice setting and tasty food! 
We live near The Hook in Burbank Ca, and after eating here, we see they are affiliated. Good food that is simple, good quality and at a great price. Great sweet potatoes fries as well!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Had the best hamburger in a long time, fire roasted chili burger and my family shared the trio with sweet potatoes, onion rings, and fries. My daughter had the Maui burger and my son the prime with double patty with bacon and avocado. Delicious!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Perfect burger stop on our way home down the coast. Great family place with play areas for the kids.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Burgers and patio are both nice enough, but the Sunday we visited it was too busy with lines at counter and restrooms. View is big disappointment, requiring step ladders to see Ocean other side of rail lines."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What's not to love about this place?! Walk up to the counter, place your order and they give you a buzzer. There's some seating inside but why sit inside when there are several places to sit outside right in front of the beach. There's a sand pit with toys for the kids to play with and plenty of tables/chairs and even chairs along the back wall so that you can look out at the beach while eating. There's a ""adults only"" sitting area right in the middle that's surrounded with trees if you'd like to eat without the noise of all the kids playing. We had fish & chips and the fish tacos and spicy fried green beans. All of the food was delicious and not too expensive. Keep in mind that this place is very casual so you might have girls walking up in bikinis (or less!)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Ambience is the THING here. It's awesome! Lots of outdoor seating - picnic tables, grass, bright flowers. This place is great for groups and for families. During the day it seems like this place really does cater to kids. There's a sandpit with toys provided and lots of grass in shady areas. 

The food is solid. There are definite healthy options available. There are salads and lean proteins, are there options on the other end of the spectrum too like nachos and cheese fries. Like I said everything was pretty good, but the definite star of the show here is the feel of the overall place. I'd go back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Family Friendly
Delicious, affordable food

Quite possibly my favorite restaurant for lunch or early dinner.  Now that Habit has taken over, the menu is delicious and more reasonable.  It is a great place for families.  There is a big sand pit area with sand toys for the kids to play in.  It is just awesome."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This is a great place to go on a warm weather day.  The food is consistently good (healthy choices can be found as can traditional lunch fare) and the views can't be beat for the price.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place to eat lunch outside and let the kids run around! Casual atmosphere and good burgers, salads and sandwiches."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"we will definitely be back.  i LOVED this place for our family of several young children after a visit to the zoo.  Seriously, was top notch as far as family friendly.  THANK YOU!  we will definitely be back next time we visit santa barbara!!! Keep it up!! you rock!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food is actually about 3 stars. The extra star is for the location. Many other reviews have said it, can't beat the outdoor, picnic style dining with amazing ocean views. Yes, it's right next to the train tracks but you should be used to that in this area. Train only came by once while we were there for dinner. Went on a Thursday night about 5:30. Glad we came at that time, as we were leaving it was starting to fill up. The grass area and sand box are great for the kids. 
The turkey burger and Caesar salad were mediocre. Everything else was ok. The shakes were good. Tried to order BBQ and was curtly told that was only on Sundays. I must have missed that sign. Would go back for the location."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I recently updated my review based on an experience we had last summer.  I was contacted by the NEW owner, and he took the time to make sure I understood he took over in the fall of 2015 and that everything was up to par.  He was very gracious and invited us back to review again.  
It is very rare that an owner will call you to discuss your concerns, and take a minute to listen to the issues, and not make excuses.  I will definitely go and enjoy another lazy afternoon here."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Order at the counter, eat al fresco! We had lunch with ten people.  The accommodating menu has something for every diet. There were a fair variety of dishes ordered by our group.  Everybody was pleased.  Fresh, hot, delicious.  The dining area is outside and beautifully landscaped.  There are many picnic tables with umbrellas, a sandbox area for children.  The environment can be noisy as the restaurant is wedged in between the train tracks and the 101 freeway.  They are, however, a matter of 50 yards from the beach which brings it own pleasant, cool air and a beautiful view to the general area.  All in all, a great place to have lunch."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great outdoor family dining with consistently good food.
Long lines but, it moves quickly."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The location is amazing with lots of room for kids to run and play
 The food is mediocre.. I ordered a chicken sandwich, and I like thin chicken, but this was so thin it really didn't fill me up. Since I went for the food, 3 stars. I would come back if I was with a group with a lot of kids."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great beachside burger and beer place that's reasonably priced!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Where can you eat on the sand, sofa, bar  and beer? Padaro! My family and I loved it. Good for friends getting together, a romantic meal, or a family day. The staff is very friendly and at the same time you get to chill without a waiter asking you every 5 minutes if everything is ""ok"". I am definitely coming here again!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We had a beautiful rehearsal dinner burger buffet here for 40 guests. The kids loved the sandbox and toys. The adults loved the food and the atmosphere. The burgers, onion rings, sweet potato fries, and toppings were delicious and freshly cooked for our big party! We also had some chicken and veggie burger options, but I didn't taste them. The staff were wonderful and professional. (4.5 stars*?*) I struggled with giving a full 5 stars, due to the fact that we had some last minute issues with a changing beer/wine availability. We had booked our party since they had some of our favorite beers, but in the week before and the day before we had some unexpected emails indicating we wouldn't have the beers we wanted. We, the bride & groom-to-be, were under a bit of stress over it, but within a few emails they had worked it out to special order some beers and were able to secure our favorite beer for the party, so In the end everything was great! We loved the laid back beach vibe for the party and were so happy that the management went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied with our food, beer, wine, and decor. Everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food and location!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Perfect place to stop for outstanding food between LA and Santa Barbara.  Very casual, with lots of seating, play areas for the kids, and excellent food.

Beautiful views with great outdoor seating.  Pay up front, get a buzzer and pick up your food when ready.   In particular their fish tacos, shrimp tacos and sweet potato fries were awesome.

We will be back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,One of my favorite places to go for lunch. To overlook the ocean and see dolphins surfing in the waves was one of my best memories here. Love that they have an area for the kids to play in the sand box and when u want to not be bothered an area just for the adults. The food is amazing and the staff is nice. Definitely going back again and again.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We really enjoyed our meal at Padaro Beach Grill.  Really Really popular in the summer.  We were lucky to eat there win the winter on a Friday for lunch.  We ordered the Fish & Chip (red snapper). Was really good.  While looking around at what others were eating the burgers and sandwiches looked really look.  We will try one next time. Love the outside eating area.  Just like a park with grass and trees and the kids have a sand pit to play in. Really a wonder place to enjoy a meal and to look out over the ocean.  Looking for an other reason to drive to Santa Barbara to try more of there food.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good food. Burgers were delicious. The bun was different and tasted great.  Very nice atmosphere. Beautiful seating outside, With a sand pit for the kids, and an adults only area just in case you wanna get away from that. Only complaint was the burger size. For the price I wish it was a bit bigger. Left a little hungry."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Amazing place to stop and have lunch by the ocean. Sandbox for the kids, plenty of outdoor seating, delicious food and laid back vibe.

Shrimp tacos did not disappoint and kids meals for $5.99 can't be beat! 

Can't wait to stop by again!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"So since I wrote my first review I have been back twice and had a good experience both times with the food and service. I think the new ownership worked out the kinks. The burgers are delicious and the selection of beers are great. I still think they are a bit overpriced so that is why I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars, but overall definitely worth a stop on your way past Carp or if you live here bring a few friends, EXCELLENT place for groups!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good food. Amazing outdoor area with a beautiful view of the ocean. My only complaint is that there is a bush-barrier that kind of blocks some of the view. Too bad. There is a child's sandbox with lots of toys to keep the little ones entertained. It appears that this place can be rented for private parties/weddings, and if not, they should! It would be a great venue."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food is about 3 to 3.5 stars, location a 5. I love the cobb salad, but my bf's pulled chicken sandwich (special Sunday BBQ) left a lot to be desired. Love the atmosphere, the location can't be beat. Sit at one of the round tables under an umbrella unless you have kids, then the picnic tables by the huge sandbox is in order. 

Service is fine. Place your order, find a table and they'll buzz you to tell you your food is ready. Live music in Sundays!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Passing thru. Found this gem on Yelp. We had the fish & chips and fish tacos. Both were excellent. Order and pick up inside. Lots of outdoor seating. Great lunch on a beautiful sunny day.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great location and delicious burgers. The perfect stop off en route back to LA. This will be a regular visit when heading south on the 101. 

Excellent spot for kids. Sand pit, high chairs and lots of grass. 

Only complaint is the lack of restrooms. One men's and one women's restroom isn't enough for a place of this size."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I'm glad we were able to check this place out on our last night in Santa Barbara. Such a neat place to hang out, eat and drink. I enjoyed my shrimp avocado tacos and my boyfriend enjoyed his pretzel burger."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Picked this place as a pit stop for my two year old daughter...did not disappoint.  Grilled ahi sandwich was great and fresh, with a brioche tasting bun.  Great grounds, well kept, and of course awesome sandbox for my daughter!  Right on the beach...refreshing pit stop on our way to SF.  FRIENDLY STAFF!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The Padaro Beach Grill is unlike any restaurant I've ever been to. The seating is outside in a grassy yard set with wooden picnic tables and umbrellas. There's a sandy area for the little kids to play, but even if your kids are older it's still a perfect family-friendly spot to enjoy lunch, dinner or even an after-beach snack. Order at the counter and relax on the sofa in the covered patio until the buzzer they gave you alerts you to get up and grab your food.

The first time we stopped by the Pedaro Beach Grill we ordered a snack: vanilla milk shakes, sweet potato fries and onion rings. They were good enough to lure us back the next day for dinner. 

All our food was great. The burgers were juicy. The onion rings were stellar. My grilled fish tacos were very tasty. We'll be back on our next trip to Carpenteria for sure."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food and fun atmosphere! Enough said.  

Oh but don't feed the birds! 

Fish tacos are yum!

Burgers are delicious!

Beer is ice cold.

Enjoy!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Driving home from San Luis Obispo, some friends and i get hungry and found some food places on the next exit. we went into a bbq place next door and the prices were expensive so we went here.  Super friendly staff and welcoming. the vibes were amazing as was the view outside. the beach is as close as can be. its an amazing outside seating area. picnic tables everywhere, grass, sand pit, and a nice little fountain and pond. the food was delicious. one of the better burgers i had had in a while. every thing about my meal was exceptional. you guys are rocking the burger scene. since then every time i drive up to Santa Barbra or san luis obispo i have to go. i bring my friends and they love it every time. its perfect after a long car ride up from the OC"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"HOLY SMOKES WOW!!!

This place is awesome. Great beach atmosphere. I feel like I'm on vacation! Food is EXCELLENT and very inexpensive. 

Non GMO, responsibly farmed, vegetarian friendly!

I highly recommend this place!

August 2015

We are back again! This place is awesome! Wish we lived closer!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We were initially on our way to another place in the Padaro Village, but randomly happened upon this gem. Drawn in by the large patio seating area and gaggle of friendly youths staffing the place we decided to stay. Good move. We ordered at the counter. I had a beach club sandwich (chicken, bacon, avo, chedder) and my lunch partner had shrimp tacos. Sandwich was delicious, A+, hit the spot. Shrimp tacos were OK. The shrimps were flavorful, but not enough smoked tarter sauce got to the bottom making the taco a bit dry. Overall, really positive experience sitting outside enjoying our food with the cool ocean breeze and warm sun on our backs. Nice pit stop on the way to Santa Barbara or beyond."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Passing through from SLO to LA and in need of some quick food in a casual setting. This place was fantastic. Ordered fish tacos at the counter and found a picnic table near the ocean. The food was fast, tasty and just the right amount. They also have beer and wine, but I was about to take on LA traffic at 6:00pm. 

It looks like a great place for kids as well. There is a big sand play area and lawn games for the kids to enjoy while the parents enjoy some great, simple food and perhaps a craft beer in a plastic cup near the ocean. 

FYI - Amtrak tracks are between the dining patio and the ocean. The train goes through at about 50mph. It's separated by a low fence and some hedges, but it'll startle you if you don't know it's there."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I try to come here whenever friends of mine visit from out of town. I love coming to this place after a day at the beach. The atmosphere and vibes here are just out of this world. It's a beautiful area. Of course the food is great, especially the calamari! I recommend everyone to come here!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Awesome place to stop. Right off the highway. Even though it was packed customers the serves was fast. Good food and beer
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Randomly found this place on yelp on our trip back to LA from Pismo Beach. It's such a cute place! 

The outdoor seating is great for a lunch or a sunday afternoon! if you peek over the bushes you can see the beach. Very casual dining, get in line to order and your buzzer goes off to pickup the food when its ready. They serve a variety of food: sandwiches, salads, burgers & some other specials They serve beer and wine, also have smoothies & milkshakes. I'd say it's worth passing by to try this place!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I ordered the Padaro burger and it did not disappoint. The burger was juicy and covered with bacon and fresh slice avocado. Fries ordered separately, choice between regular, sweet potato, onion rings or all three. The seating is mostly outdoor and covered which was perfect for a sunny day on the coast.  Parking was tricky but free. Would absolutely recommend this place!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We had lunch on Friday, the food was great. I had the fish taco. The ambiance is very relaxed and intimate."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place and their food, I recommend the Hickory Burger. It has to be one of my favorite burgers ever. Owned by the same people who own the Habit supposedly. Only complaint is that it is a bit pricey for serve yourself food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great little place!  We found it on Yelp, first visit and will definitely be returning.  Lots of choices for any kind of food preference, wel priced and yummy! Big bonus is huge garden setting outdoor eating as well as indoor seating.  We had salads and deep fried spicy green beans with ranch dressing."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Came in for the fish tacos and they did not disappoint.  Quick counter service, beer and wine available.  Good place for the family to go, food ready within 10 minutes on a busy Saturday

Would recommend and would try to make it back here soon"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Beautiful view of the ocean and very kid friendly...that alone gives this place 5 stars for me.  Kids loved the sand play area we loved the plentiful setting area with picnic tables on the grass.  The food was good I had the captains platter with a little bit of everything (shrimp, calamari, fish) fried to perfection,  batter was crispy and delicious."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is AWESOME!  First, their food was delicious... i had their hawaiian burger and it came out fast and very tasty.  The key to this place is their location, although it was overcast on the day that we went it was still a beautiful place to sit and enjoy being outside.  If you have kids, it's a perfect atmosphere as there are a million of them around (j/k)....but seriously one of the best places to come as a family, let the rugrats run around.  They have a great sand pit for the kids to play in...it's just all in all a great place to stop at for lunch."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food, good prices and a great outdoor eating area, right on the beach. I will go here everytime I am near the area, good selection of beers and food, I enjoyed the shrimp po boy and sweet potatoes fries with a cookie shake, while my husband had tacos. There is a huge sand pit for kids to play in and a good amount of outdoor seating, though indoor seating is extremely limited. Worth a stop!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Yummy burgers.  Friendly service. Super kid friendly. Great outdoor atmosphere that makes you feel like your at a beach resort.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Great atmosphere for a relaxed lunch, but beware the bathroom line is at least 10-15 minutes long because there is only 1 for men and 1 for women. They really need to set up portable toilets for the kids because they can't wait that long and there are TONS of kids there. Because of that I probably won't be back with my family. The kids were miserable and so were the adults that had to go.

Also, burgers are good but both Cobb salads that were ordered with my party were flavorless."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,What an awesome jewel in Santa Barbara!!!!  Great food and service!!  There is a sand area for the kids to play in without worrying about them getting wet at the ocean!  Genius idea!!  They have little sand toys and beach chairs if you want to sit in the sand with them.  The kids also liked to watch the trains go by.  It does get pretty windy since it is right next to the ocean.  So bring jackets for the little ones.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Easy on and off the 101 from Santa Barbara - we stopped for lunch on our way home on a Sunday after a weekend in Santa Barbara.   Good selection of food - burgers, sandwiches, tacos - what you would expect at an upscale beach burger stand.  The sweet potato fries were amazing, as was the California burger.  My wife loved the shrimp tacos.

Dining is mostly outside on nice picnic style tables. There is some indoor seating, but I can't imagine why you would sit indoors here unless it was raining.

This will be a regular stop for us when we're driving the 101."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I'm very comfortable open air place to have a terrific beach meal. The food is fantastic. It's hard to decide what to choose from when you see your choices. Our party had the fish tacos both grilled and Baja, salad with chicken, fish and chips and fish sandwich. My only regret is that I didn't try a hamburger as well! Ve"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great stop for quick lunch on our way to wine tasting.  Sat at outdoor bar top table with ocean view!  Had fish tacos, burger, onion rings which were all good."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The food was fine but beware their website that claims it's dog friendly because it's not. After I bought a ton of food we were asked to leave because of my little dog. When I mentioned the website, THEIR website I got an ""oh well"" attitude."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The food was decent but what makes it a 4 is having a sand box for the kids to play in!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Love the burgers and five at this place. It's a lot of fun to sit out by the ocean and watch the kids play in the sandbox
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Adorable place with lots of outdoor seating, right next to beach and the food was pretty good!!! Had fish Baja fish tacos (they were a bit on the tiny side but tasty), fish and chips and my kid had the grilled cheese (winner).  Celebrity sighted on the day I went, all around great atmosphere!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good burgers, nice beachy atmosphere, a little too crowded on weekends but that's to be expected at the beach.    Totally understand why they don't allow dogs as their beautiful backyard/picnic area would basically become a dog park if they were allowed.  I imagine that pet owners are dismayed but you have to look at both sides of the issue."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is absolutely amazing!!! I never knew about this until a friend took us here after a day at the Santa Barbara Zoo wit the kids. The view of the ocean is absolutely amazing. Its a quick ""on and off"" the 101 freeway location of Santa Claus Lane. The grounds of the property are awesome - it reminds us of being in Hawaii! They were playing Bob Marley, so it has this island, tropical, chill ""island oasis"" vibe that we just loved! They have a huge sand area for the kids, a bar and tons of picnic tables with umbrellas. They also have an ""adult only"" area for hanging out with out kids. However, the BEST part - was the food. Everything we ordered came out looking beautifully prepared and presented. We got a tuna melt, fish tacos, chicken caesar salad, fries, onion rings and everything was 100% perfection!!!! If the drive wasn't an hour away for us, I would literally come here on a weekly basis. We also loved that you can order and pay for your own and get a number - so that its easy for groups and you don't have to split the check. Overall - this place is a total score and its a ""must go""!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Thank you Yelpers!  This place is exquisite!  I had the shrimp and avocado salad with their homemade thousand island.  Great croutons and super crisp salad.  The location cannot be beat.  Picnic table just by the beach - this place is like an oasis.   Prices are great for such quality food.  Young people working at counter were friendly, attentive and provided a great experience.  A fantastic place for families to dine with younger children."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Hubby took me to lunch in Carpinteria (he is so sweet) to this little spot he found while working in the area. I must say, this is now among my favorite. It is lovely, welcoming, clean and spacious locale sprinkled with umbrella covered patio tables and picnic tables a small pond, adults only firepit area, and sandbox area for kids, all with the sound of waves crashing against the break wall. The staff are super friendly, welcoming and energetic. 

I ordered a cobb salad made with very tasty freshly grilled chicken, hubby had Baja fish tacos he said we're delicious, and we shared fried calamari appetizer. As if I wasn't already impressed with Parado Grill, this is the best calamari I have had anywhere. It was so good I had to get a second order for us to munch on the drive home (I am so stuffed right now). We will absolutely make the drive out again. Besides sharing calamari, I want to try some of their other items as I suspect I won't be disappointed with any of their offerings."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I happened upon this place on a trip down the coast. It's awesome. You order at the counter and go outside and sit at picnic tables with a view of the ocean. Sandbox for kids. The spouse and I ordered a burger, tacos, fries, lemonade and shake to get a sampling of it all. And we loved everything. Super casual fun beach shack vibe. Only drawback is crappy parking."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Delicious burgers and fries! Beautiful place to enjoy lunch outdoors at a reasonable price.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I stopped at Padaro Beach to stretch our legs and found ourselves chowing down at the beach grill. I'm not a big burger fan so I had the bbq chicken salad which was the best I've ever had, every bite was a yummy surprise topped with crunchy tortilla strips. My husband had the hickory burger with chedder cheese and said it was amazing, we split onion rings and a chocolate shake which were fantastic. We will certainly be back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Kids love coming to Padaro!  Fun sand area for kids to play while parents can talk and relax. Food is amazing, fast service and great portions. Today we had fish tacos and shrimp salad. We love stopping here each trip to Santa Barbara. Wish they had another location in the Bay Area!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I saw dolphins, well my sister saw them and then she showed me.  So cool, I love sea creatures. 
     I shared a bbq chicken salad with my mother, it was good.  I liked the frispy tortilla strips they put atop.  There was bacon on the salad, not really my thing, most of y'all would love it though.  They have really tasty nachos here.
     Lots of green space and a huge sand pit for the kids, too.  No beach access from the grill due to the train tracks, but it is certainly within walking distance.  The outdoor firepit was appreciated as well because it was a cooler night when we visited"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Very good food,great tasting,great for families,great view.But needs to give a little more food.My fish tacos only had like an ounce of fish in each one...but very tasty
 and I will be back,but of course I want to be very satisfied..."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Celebrating a birthday here at this traditional American resturant with my puppy & family! Oops, ""no dogs allowed""... Its weird enough that its a completely outdoor resturant with a beachy scene but a dogs not allowed! Anyways, customer service is great, all employees are energetic and willing to help! 

BUZZ BUZZ, food is ready! A fancy pager with a smexy women's voice saying ""your food is ready."" The food is OKAY. Nothing special, nothing fancy but did the trick! 

I'll give it a 3 star for the OKAY experience. If you enjoy outdoors right next to the beach and a quick and easy meal, check this place out!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Wow! What happened here? I like my burgers rare and this restaurant had a good one- until this last time. Ordered it rare and got.., very well done. And quickly too. Reheating precooked burgers? Don't know. Slow time of day, no one else ordering, and burger was very very very well done. Disappointing. Same good fries, ripe tomato, great ""brioche"" bun, badly over cooked burger."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic place! Outside dining! Great menu with reasonable prices & tasty food! Kids can play in the sand! Picnic tables outside! Greatest place for families! Sunset views! Yummy onion rings, burgers & grill cheese. Big portion of nachos!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely adorable place! Great quick service, great food. Nachos delicious! Cobb salad fresh! Burger was just ok. Would come again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The burger and salads are very good! Super friendly staff and nice location at the sea. Even with a long waiting line the food is prepared very fast.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is a great beachside place to grab a casual bite to eat. I would say this place caters to families and big groups, as it is full of kids every time I've gone. The food is basic but always good and quick. The service is nice and the location/decor is extra great.  Tons of room in the back to have kids running around and picnic style tables."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"One of, if not the best restaurant in Carpinteria.  Awesome setting right on the beach and railroad tracks.  Food is all delicious and they have a large menu. I've only experienced good service every time I've been there as well.  My only complaint is long lines if you come anywhere near lunch time and parking is terrible in that area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome spot!!!!!!!! Stopped here today with my husband and young kids. Such a great environment - casual, yet classy. The kids had a great time playing in the sand and our food was delicious! I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and it was to die for - fresh and a generous portion! 

We ordered a burger, a salad, two beers, and a kids meal cost us about $30 -- totally reasonable!

We'll definitely be back again soon! 
I'd also choose this as a playdate/mommy meet up spot!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I loved the food and the outdoor setting, not fancy, this is on your way to the beach restaurant, wear your shorts and flip-flops, but good food, friendly people, decent prices, absolutely must go if you are in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Made an unscripted pit stop here while road tripping. Awesome gourmet burgers, wine, beer, huge outdoor area within earshot of the waves, sand pit for kids to play in, adults-only terrace area....basically something for everyone."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The new Padaro Beach Grill is by far the best of the dozen or so places in coastal Santa Barbara county where you can eat and drink on / near the beach. Play space for kids and private deck for adults only makes for a great mix. 

Reasonably priced. 3 entrees, sodas and 2 sides for less than $40 - super fresh ingredients. Helpful busboy to clean up and lend a hand."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Delicious food, ocean breeze, wine, and a sand pit to occupy the kids... what more can I ask for?

The burgers are amazing, and their sweet potato fries are the best!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Best onion rings, awesome burgers, beautiful view. Good beer too. We stopped in for lunch and loved this place."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My family always stops in when we are in town.

Burgers are decent. Shrimp tacos are good. Prices aren't terrible.

The biggest plus about this place is the outside seating on picnic tables with the huge sandbox for kids. So comfortable to sit and talk while eating and have the little kids play next to us in the sandbox. 

Perfect combo. Good food & wonderful atmosphere.

We always keep coming back."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Sally Spork reviews Padaro Beach Grill 

Atmosphere: I've been to this spot for over a decade and the new restaurant Padaro Beach Grill which replaced the old is well renovated and the landscape is comfortable and lush with plenty of outdoor seating with picnic tables, umbrellas, palm trees and a large sandbox for kids, as well as a lovely pond. We sat outside in the area marked 'adults only' for those that want to have a more relaxing conversation/experience; well appreciated amongst the kids running about.

Service: You order inside and seat yourself. You are given a buzzer which goes off when your food is ready. One time we went the food was quick, another time the order came in stages. Granted, the place was packed. One time we we were there for their Sunday special of chicken/tri tip. After waiting in line, and ordering, we got buzzed: not that the food was ready but they were out of chicken. Drat! So they gave us tri tip only. 

Food/drink: We've ordered a variety of choices off the menu: fish tacos, nachos, tri-tip, salad, burgers. Overall the food is very tasty. Best awards go to the fish tacos and grilled chicken salad. Beware the ice cream (Roti's) is 3.75 for little more than a dixie cup serving. 

Summary: I love this spot. The food is great, atmosphere lovely and a great place for dining solo, a few friends or a larger group."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I love this place and wish I could visit more often. My family went for my birthday, and after lunch I was able to send my kids to play in the sandbox while I enjoyed my wine. Who wouldn't love that?! The food is simple, good food but what you're really going for is the atmosphere and the ocean view. 

Definitely worth the drive!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The most beautiful outdoors setting, ever! Very calming backyard ambiance by the beach. Great views. Enjoyed a delicious Tuna Melt (extra grilled), everything here is served a la carte. Pay up front, get a buzzer and pick up your food when ready. Friendly staff member goes around asking if you need anything. Resort-like vibe. 

No pets allowed."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The burger, apart from being really tiny, was bland.  Shredded lettuce felt cheap-o and the chilis were small and scarce (on something called a Fire Roasted Chili Burger?).  Did I mention it was a tiny burger too!? Seriously tiny.  We were very disappointed, especially after seeing pictures online to know the food was sooooo small for such a big price.  So why 2 stars?  Well, the people were nice.  They had free WIFI.  

Almost didn't eat here as the Garden Market place next door was our original destination.  That place was completely out of a bunch of their food options so we decided to give Padaro Beach Grill a shot.  It had decent reviews.  Not sure why.

I wouldn't go here if you don't loooove kids as there is a huge sandbox playground just for kids right in the center of the area -- and kids were everywhere -- my guess is they are hoping to attract families to eat, but at these prices/portions, I would not imagine they'll get so many.  There were large printed warning signs for people not to bring their own food/coolers so I am guessing folks are taking advantage and bringing their kids and loading up their own food and using it as a free park.  Not great.

The onion rings looked like the usual frozen variety.  Nothing special here.  Think twice if you have other options for lunch.  We should have held out for somewhere different."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Located on Santa Claus Lane (who remembers when it was actually Santa Claus Lane?) it's a great location that serves hamburger, sandwiches, tacos and salad. We got fish and shrimp tacos and proceeded to their massive outdoor eating space. There's a stage for bands at night, an outdoor bar (looks like for night only) sand pit for kids and plenty of picnic benches with umbrellas. The view speaks for itself. You get a better view of the beach if you sit at the high table bar but it has no umbrellas and the picnic tables have a break from the wind compliments of the shrubs. The food was great. Beer and wine served in plastic cups. Great pit stop for us while plant shopping. Will definitely return!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We really enjoyed this restaurant. A wonderful place for a family to be able to stretch out and enjoy lunch. A very laid back, beachy vibe with tables and umbrellas out on the grass, close to the beach."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fish tacos and beer... with a sandy fully stocked beach area for the kids! Tacos were just tightening avocado, slaw and a great sauce. Pick was on point too! 
Definitely worth a stop!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I hate to sound cliche, but this place really is a hidden gem.  I've driven up the coast to Santa Barbara hundreds of times and never once exited at Santa Clause Lane.  I was headed up to Santa Barbara for work and my coworker suggested we stop here for lunch.  It was love at first sight for me.  The property is beautiful.  You can sit inside at tables, picnic benches, or a couch, or go outside and find a table in the grass.  There's a large sandbox to occupy the kiddos.  There are ""adult only"" areas (THANK YOU!).  You can sit and watch the dolphins play in the surf.  Between the dining area and the ocean is the train tracks.  When the trains go by it feels like you could reach out and touch them.  DON'T do that.  lol.  The food is really good.  The fish is fresh.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there's a tiny little bit of attitude from some of the cashiers, and you can't bring your dog to sit with you outside.  That's not cool.  I don't want my dog to wait for me in the hot car."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place.  Beautiful gardens, great food and great service.  Oh yah, good beer selection too!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The food was excellent and the picnic area was beautiful. They have a huge sand area for kids.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,This place is nice. It was crowded but the line moved really fast and the food came out quickly too. It had a wide variety of items on the the menu. The food however wasn't anything special for the price and sides are not included so a burger with fries and cost upwards of $10 adding a drink and tax and it's close to $15. The patio seating area provides a nice environment to eat in but you have to watch out for the birds and bugs. All in all it was a nice place I'd eat here again if I had to but it wouldn't be my #1 choice.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Huge fan of this place for many years.  Food is great, but it tends to get very crowded during the summer on weekends.  Very children friendly too!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Perfect stop as we headed up the coast. SO great we hit it again on the way back down. Their food is yummy - the house salad is amazing, huge and fresh. The beach club was very good, quality ingredients. My son loved the kids burger. You order at the counter then find a table out back, in the large yard with a kids sand pit (toys provided!) The area is fenced in so the kids dont wonder across the train tracks or down the beach. I would go here every week if we lived close by. Only thing it was missing was music."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"New ownership = brilliant

It used to be that you put up with the terrible and over priced food (that took forever no less) for the wonderful local and sandbox. 

No longer!!!

The food quality has improved dramatically while the prices have actually gone down! They added a raised deck with a polite ""no children"" sign that I have mixed feelings about. It actually has a view of the beach and seems quite nice but those of us with kids are excluded. I get that they are trying to accommodate those who want to eat their lunch in peace but given the deck's proximity to the sandbox this seems like a fruitless attempt."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place is a gem! My husband and I were traveling up to Santa Barbara with our two tots and were so happy to have found Padaro Beach Grill. The food was wonderful and the ambiance was just perfect! The outdoor space couldn't have been more family friendly. A sandbox for the kids to play in and a sunset view to enjoy while my husband and I finished our wine.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"While everyone else had said all the wonderful things about Padaro grill, my main reason to review is to mention the food is really quite a bargain. I'm marking it with a single $ sign. For instance a really great chicken sandwich at $6.95. You pay that much at a chain fast food. But at Padaro it is quality food with the most pleasant outdoor dining for 50 radius!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"If your looking for a true food joint on the beach than look no further!! The outdoor seating over looking the ocean is worth the trip within its self, then you add in good quality food and this place is a homerun!! We will definitely be back when in the area!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food is great, atmosphere is great. They should invest in installing speakers to listen to music while eating."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"9 year old: I love their French fries.
6 year old: I love the gummie hand burgers.
2 year old: 
Mom: the atmosphere is sweet and the salad is good.
Dad: relaxing environment for the family. Good food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great menu, food was really good. Lots of outside room to eat. If you have little kids you'll love this...they have a sand section where kids can play while you enjoy your food-easily within eye sight of practically any table."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I frequent the Padaro Beach Grill and for the most part we receive excellent service, this last time I was very disappointed. My husband is a local Carp Summerland firefighter and we decided to have a retirement party for one of our firefighters at the Padaro Beach Grill. After ordering food and drinks for over 30 people we requested paper plants and plastic forks to serve the sheet cake we had brought and the guy denied me saying we needed to provide our own. After I offered to pay for them he came back with a bad attitude and 15 plates. I was very disappointed in his service and I hope that the owners have an opportunity to read this comment.
Update: I'm changing my star rating from a two to a four because of the quick response I received from the owner, she was very kind and listened to my experience with an open mind. I'm not going to let one bad apple sour the whole bunch, the food is too good!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I come here all the time but have noticed that the quality of food has gone from a solid five stars to a 3 1/2.  Ambience is still a solid 5 stars.  This is a great place to go - especially if you have kids since there is a huge sand pit with toys for the littles to play with.  We were here last night (it wasn't busy) and the kitchen put our order together wrong.  (My husband asked for Cheddar on his burger and Swiss cheese was put on it.  I asked for dressing on the side and they tossed my salad with dressing.  Our receipt had everything we communicated.  It was just very disappointing.  Our fries were mostly overcooked and dark brown and crunchy.)  
I do recommend coming here and I will continue to frequent this place but I do hope that the food starts to improve to the meet the higher standards it used to have."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,They must have read my review they purchase more umbrellas now I'm giving them five stars beautiful job.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"If you're looking for the most beautiful place to eat in Carpinteria, this is the place to go. Simply beautiful. It would be your favorite burger, but you'll go back & order it again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Staff is friendly, welcoming, and efficient. If owner/manager is reading this, please give them the compliments they deserve!
Had fish tacos...still craving them. The location and ambience can't be beat.
Well done."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,This place used to allow dogs. Under the new ownership they don't allow them. Giving them a 3 simply because of that. The food is still good.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great outdoor seating area. Gets crowded so get there early. The breading on the fish and beans are so good!! Great food, large portions."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The food is awesome and the beach view is the best. You can't go wrong if you are in the area. The burgers are so fresh and Ice cream is perfect. We got a bacon burger and a root beer float. The place to stop!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Stopped at Padaro Beach Grill for lunch. AMAZING burgers! Beautiful views! Great spot to bring the entire family. There is a ton of grass and a really nice sandpit for the kids. We will definitely be back in the near future.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Amazing venue! Has long been a local favorite and they have amazing kombucha on tap that's organic and brewed locally in Carpinteria!! Place is right on the beach, so cool!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Like many of the other reviews, the food and setting are good. A great place for lunch by the beach."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,I went in and ordered a chicken Caesar salad to go and was not very pleased. I should have ordered the dressing on the side but i did not think they would put THAT much dressing on the salad. It was completely drenched and soggy and i opened it just a few minutes after getting it so it wasn't sitting for long. I couldn't eat it because the dressing was just taking over the whole salad and it did not taste good.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Burgers and fishNchips rock...  Same ownership as The Habit!!!  But the outdoor beach thing has no equal in the area...  Enjoy!!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We were camping in SB from LA and were told this was a must see on our road trip. We stopped by for lunch today and I must say it didn't disappoint!! The pretzel burger was hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. We also split nachos and the Baja Fish tacos. The nachos were delicious with tons of toppings and the fish tacos were average taste but a little smaller portion than I would have guessed for $10 or so. Loved the grounds it was beautiful to sit outside surrounded by palm trees and they even had a little sandbox for kids to play in. Picnic tables were nicely scattered apart so you had space to chat and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. Will definitely recommend this place to everyone- makes you feel like you've escaped to a Hawaiian island for an hour!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Best place to stop for lunch on your drive to or from Santa Barbara. We stumbled on this place when my wife's stomach started growling and we wanted a 4+ star restaurant on Yelp ASAP. This place was amazing, great food, perfect scenery, pretty reasonable prices too."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My favorite new place in Santa Barbara!
I highly recommend to check-out this beachfront restaurant if you're in town.
The eating environment is exceptional with both inside and outside seating room. The ocean views are mesmerizing.
The food is without a doubt delicious. Ordered the house salad and shrimp tacos. The shrimp is properly satauee and cooked to perfection. The house salad has the right portion of goat cheese, dried cranberries, and toasted almonds.
Children seem to enjoy this place more than the adults; outside seating area is spacious. Definitely, a family oriented gem."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"This is my first negative review of any restaurant. How the heck did it get any positive reviews?  This place used to be so much better under the prior owners. We ordered the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, onion rings, and chicken nachos. I have no problem paying premium prices for premium food but this food is total crap. They should have called them cabage tacos because that was pretty much all you got in your taco. Unfortunately they have a great location and not much coompetition so doubtful that the food will ever get better unless new management takes it over."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great burgers and a great spot to take the kids when they want to play, and you want to relax. Off the beaten path by the beach on Padaro/Santa Claus Lane. Parking isn't ideal, but it's doable, for a one-way frontage road. Just look both ways before you cross the street or and don't back out without really watching. The large outdoor area consists of grass, picnic tables, and a sizable sandpit. Plenty of toys to play with and lots of room for the kiddos to run around without disturbing the other patrons. Safely tucked behind a low fence and thick hedge, so the proximity to the train tracks doesn't pose any issues. The brioche buns and juicy burgers are a treat (and very reasonably priced)."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place was such a great find! My family and I were on the way back from the Alpaca farm, when we decided to stop for lunch. Their eating area is so family-friendly (and drunk adult friendly), complete with a kids sandbox, view of the water from certain sitting areas, a lot of benches, lights, and a closed off drinking area. 

I expected it to be extremely crowded, but it wasn't! There was so much room that we hopped tables until we found the perfect one. 

The food also came in HUGE portions, and for a place by the beach, the prices were not bad at all. We got the chili cheese nachos, caesar salad, fish & chips, and a burger. They were all good! Between four adults and one ""pre-teen"" as my niece calls herself, we were stuffed from all the food we got. The nachos were probably my favorite... so good! 

I would bring my friends back here the next time I'm in Santa Barbara!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place was the BEST when I worked in Carpinteria! My favorite, go-to lunch spot. Can't beat the ambiance of the outside eating area, especially on a nice, sunny (typical) day there.

Prices are very fair, and would recommend the BBQ chicken salad or the veggie burger.

Brought my family there when they visited and they loved it too. Check this place out!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Cute place! Food was just o-k. Nothing to rave about. I got the Baja fish tacos and every time I tried to take a bite... everything fell out because the fish was in weird fried balls. Other than that, I liked the atmosphere. Although.... I must say... parents do NOT keep track of their kids in here. Lol. Not the restaurants fault though. Fun place for family dinners."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"After a long afternoon driving the Pacific coast highway, this place is a welcome oasis for some casual relaxation and good food. Try the fish tacos! And note that Santa Claus Lane is 25mph, and there are kids."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped at this restaurant for lunch on the way back to Southern California from Santa Barbara based on the reviews of others. The restaurant was right off the freeway and right on the beach, who could ask for more? The food was excellent. I had the California burger and my mom had the tuna melt, we both enjoyed our meals as well as the clean outdoor eating area, fresh lemonade and iced tea, and beautiful weather. The bird situation got a little dodgy for a minute or so but they eventually moved on. I would definitely stop here again when in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This was a lovely place! We were there on a gorgeous day and it was so nice to sit outside and feel the ocean breeze. There were more kids than I have ever seen at a restaurant, but it was not a big deal because it is outside and the sound of the ocean masks other sounds. The food was really yummy also. We were not a big fan of the chocolate fudge shake, but the grilled chicken sandwich was awesome and the prime burger was delicious."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Had a great lunch here! Super happy that they have lettuce wraps, but they aren't executed that well. Too much chunky lettuce that is difficult to hold and not really cut up with a burger eater in mind. But generally delicious, and low carb and keto friendly with the avocado/cheese/bacon add-ons"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,You don't come here for the food...it's the setting and atmosphere. I'm eating sweet potato fries and the beach is yards away...and a train just sped by feet from my face. This is California.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Stopped by here to catch the sunset. Beer was reasonable and we also got a quesadilla to share the quesadilla was monstrous in size. There were several families enjoying their sandbox... my only criticism is that they need to cut the bushes lower so that you can view the sunset more easily. We were lucky to get a table on the elevated area where we could see the sunset but most people there could not see it. Also it was quite muddy. I feel sorry for those parents with all those little kids running in the mud and sand. The cleanup must be atrocious.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome!  The food is good, but the location is better!  It's right by the beach, and the outside seating is like an ocean side park.  There are some smaller tables and even a play area for children.  There is also an adult only area if you find children repulsive.

Parking is easy and the restaurant is located in a cute little town.  You can go hang out at the beach before or after your visit."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great food at reasonable prices. Awesome atmosphere next to the ocean. The only negative is that some of the parents focus on drinking moe than watching the kids.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped at Santa Claus Lane in Carpenteria while riding my motorcycle.  This place has changed so much, it's crazy. We decided to eat here since we saw there was people eating. I must say, I was not disappointed. I got the ahi tuna sandwich rare and it was just right. Simple sandwich with lots of flavor. The fries were not bad either. I like the pick nick style area to eat. The weather was a wonderful 75 with a light breeze. I will definitely stop here again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Amazing find! Great location right on the beach, gorgeous views. Shrimp tacos amazing, burger absolutely delicious. We were looking forward to the ""adult only"" section but children were in all of those areas. I was also delighted to see this restaurant offers dairy free coconut milk ice cream. I will definitely come back when in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Rarely does a favorite neighbourhood eatery close, re-open under new management, and instantly become a better establishment in every way. Great for families, young lovers on dates,  biker dudes in their 60's with their old ladies, and anyone else who'd enjoy a fresh meal at a fair price, served with a smile in a great outdoor location along the California coastline."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I LOVE THIS PLACE. I have always loved it even with all the different owners. Great burgers and they have a huge menu. Great spot for kids so they can play. Always a plus to be on the beach
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Bottom Line: an awesome place to spend an afternoon hanging out with friends and eating lunch... but $3.50 for SIX ONION RINGS?!

I grew up in SB and this location has changed hands several times.  The current owners spent a lot of time making this place really cool to visit and hang out in the sunshine, especially if you have a family in your crew.
     The food they serve is good without question.  My favorite repeat lunch is the chicken sandwich - super yummy moist chicken.  Their shakes are even good.... but I cannot give this place 5 stars when I buy my wife and I lunch and it's $50.  
    As i said above, a few onion rings is $3.50 - Im sorry thats kind of crazy.  This place on the weekends is slammed quite often so I understand the prices if anything to keep the crowds down a bit, but c'mon....."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food: I ordered the Prime Burger and added Cheddar cheese. I also ordered their shrimp tacos. The tacos came with some chips. I ordered my food to go. They gave me a pager while I waited for my food. It was a pretty short wait. I took it back to my motel room to eat it. The burger was pretty good but on the small side. I liked the shrimp tacos better than the burger. They were good! Both items were good enough that I will definitely make a return trip if I'm ever in the area again.

Location:  It's sort of tucked away on the beach side of a small road next to the freeway called Santa Claus Lane. That road apparently is used for accessing the beach. Parking should be plentiful but you'll have to contend with those going to the beach. There's outdoor seating if you prefer to eat your meal outside."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Love to take family and friends here!!! Enjoyable atmosphere where kids can be kids and adults can sit back relax and enjoy a good meal and beautiful weather! Love the bbq chicken salad and the ahi tuna!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Our newest favorite.  For a beachside cafe, this is a wonderful spot.  Having lived in California for some time now, we've been to just about every one you can find from San Diego to San Francisco  and this one is one of the very best.  

Pricing... keeping in mind we're talking about California, the pricing was reasonable.  For a hungry family of 5, we got everyone served for less than $55.

Food... was very good, not necessarily outstanding or worthy of awards but very good. 

We absolutely love the outdoor seating and views.  Wish only they could have  a section for my golden [dog] as that would be a nice touch that you see with some of the other coastal cafe's. 

My only real regret is no WiFi.  I know this might sound a bit trivial but this would be a great spot if you are a frequent traveler up and down the coast.  I can most certainly see myself stoping in every time for lunch if only... it had WiFi.  Owners,  this would be a easy investment that would make this fan... even bigger :-)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"My family loves this place but of the 3 times I have stopped in on a long trip from Northern Calif to L.A., 2 of those 3 times they have been out of Ahi Tuna.  And tonight, my 2nd choice was the pretzel burger but they were out of pretzel bread.  What an incredibly inept management to be out of so many items consistently. And what am I supposed to do after waiting in line for 20 minutes??  I will pass next time.  Not worth the hassle . . . . ."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great family place, good food. Perfect for big or small parties."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love the atmosphere in the sunny, rabbit and child-filled beer garden, and the quality of the food (fish tacos and roast chili burgers with fries). If you're lucky a train will shoot by just yards from your picnic table. 

Also, in terms of conservation, I appreciate that they use minimal disposable plastic: sandwiches are served in reusable baskets lined with paper, beer served in compostable cups and paper containers for the catsup."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fish tacos and beer... with a sandy fully stocked beach area for the kids! Tacos were just right with grilled fish, avocado, slaw and a great sauce. Pico was on point too! 
Nice choices of draft beer. Definitely worth a stop!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,the burgers are great for the price. Milkshakes are super thick and the sweet potato fires are delicious. Amazing place to eat lunch on a super sunny day. Gets really busy during the summer and always full of families. I would recommend coming here on one of those random 75 and sunny winter days. No shoes required
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Good food but a little pricey but can't beat the location. Been here many times over the years, with mixed results. Today was certainly a miss day on some of the service - from experience, if they aren't too busy then they do better but this latest it was very busy. 

We ordered without issue but the problem came with the soda machine. My husband likes diet coke and I like sprite but both were ""out"" in the sense the syrup flavoring needed to be refilled for the machine (sprite was like seltzer water and coke was clear). I pointed it out to the cashier and they sent a busboy over to see what the issue was and I showed him. Over several minutes, I see him wandering to their storage closet then back to the kitchen. My husband had taken our baby outside to seating with our food buzzer, he called me because I had been gone so long. Several people came to get soda but were getting the same result and the drain was full of ice from people dumping bad soda, finally someone got dark diet coke but when I tried sprite it still tasted bad. I had been standing there for at least ten minutes and our food was now ready yet no one had bothered to say they had fixed it so I could get my drink. I got my husband's drink and took it to him then went back and told the cashier I wanted a refund on my drink cuz the sprite still wasn't working. Finally another girl who appears to be an asst manager comes to check she runs around a bit then says the hose wasn't completely on so sorry. Finally got my drink but the food was now cold. Incompetent staff until someone above finally does the job right.

ETA: I forgot to mention, the burger we had was decent but nothing special but I expected better portions for the fish n chips. They were pretty good but come on... Potatoes are cheap for the chips and depending on the fish, it wouldn't cost this much any other place."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I absolutely love it here.

Such a fun ambience with the picnic tables overlooking the water. the lemonade and iced tea are both freshly made and always so refreshing- the burgers are out of this world, same goes for the chicken sandwich (get it with teriyaki!) 

the coleslaw and sweet potato fries as sides are also worth raving about and from what i've heard the milkshakes are as well. overall great food, quick and friendly service, and you can't beat the view. it gets crowded around lunch time so get there early, although there are tons of tables so it doesn't usually take too long."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is a spot we love to stop at when we drive this way. Great for kids, dogs and anyone who loves good food and outdoor seating."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Have stopped here twice when in the area. We especially love the atmosphere-the outdoor seating and the fun things for kids to do outside. Food is good, but what really makes this place memorable is the setting and atmosphere. Definitely visit Padaro if you have a chance to."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is a great family restaurant!  First, it's classic grill food at very reasonable prices.  Second, it's mostly outdoor seating with a sandbox for the kids and an amazing view of the ocean!  Third, the food is really good for what it is.  Lots of seating and lots of space.  We will be back!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I LOVE the atmosphere, however the food quality could def be improved upon. Nowadays, healthy local is the way to go. I would just like to see some more organic, local farmer's market options and would be happy to pay more. The location is so lovely and ppl will happily pay more for it, so why not make the food up to that standard? Other than that, it's perfect for kids bday's."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Over all great place to relax have the kids play in the sandbox the food  is great we had a birthday party we had will the event coordinator reserve out tables  
The staff above and beyond customer service"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good burger at a good price. Self service in a nice outdoor ambience. The music is easy listening from the 60s with Beach Boys and Paul Simon figuring prominently. Great place for lunch in good weather. I enjoyed the California burger which was about 1/3 lb with cheese, avocado,red pepper and grilled onions."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"One of our favorite spots in Carpinteria. Right on the beach and super affordable. Sand area for the kids to play with plenty of outdoor seating. 

We had the fish sandwich with yellowtail. Delicious and fresh. Got the trio of fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings to go with it. Perfect meal before hitting the beach. 

Shakes and malts are super yummy, very rich in flavor. 

Parking is difficult and it can get crowded, but worth the wait. Nice to just sit outside and relax while waiting for your food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is very nice. The food is good, but not necessarily amazing. The vibe just makes this place the restaurant you always come back when in Carpinteria.

This is a place to go if you have small kids, just toss them in the sand while you sip some kind of alcohol, and everybody is happy.

I do wish they had better sand toys and that they had better quality sand. They had a problem with seagulls, but the restaurant has done an amazing job keeping most of them away.

The staff is friendly, but sometimes the bathrooms need attendance."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great fish and chips. Awesome setting. I'm just happy the train didn't roll by while I was eating.

I will definitely be back when I'm passing through town."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome!!  We stopped here for dinner on our way back (to LA) from a day trip to Santa Barbara and it was a perfect spot to cap off the day. A GREAT place for kids due to their giant sandbox you can see from the tables.  And other little areas to run around too. And trains go by every once in awhile too, which the kids also like to stop and watch. Kids had a blast, adults were able to hang out and relax a bit.  Food was good too. We are vegetarian and I got a veggie burger and sweet potato fries, and kids got grilled cheese. We all were happy!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I went there last week. It was busy as usual. We ordered the shrimp and avocado salad. Terrible !! The avocado was not ripe, the shrimp were over cooked. I also asked for balsamic dressing. Tasted like greasy vinegar. Very expensive. I love the beach but that was not worth it."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Beautiful restaurant with an incredible take on beach burgers. I also enjoy the brews on tap. I will drive 2 hours at least once a month just to enjoy this place! Highly recommended.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Just love this place!  The food is not anything out of this world but it's consistent pub grub. The highlight of this hangout is location location location!  Right by the ocean with a big open grassy area with picnic tables and a huge sand pit with sand toys for the kiddos!  What could be better after a day at the beach than sitting down with a cold brew and burger and not have to contain the kids!  They manage very long lines very efficiently!  Will always come back!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Very cool outdoor restaurant. Burgers, fish and chips, salads, right by the beach.  Enjoy stopping in for a good burger when we are passing by."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My wife and I shared the shrimp tacos and a cajun style shrimp Po Boy. The Po Boy was good, in fact, one of the best I've ever had. But the shrimp tacos stole the show! It was a wonderful place to eat (as long as the weather is nice) some delicious food. If the weather is not nice it still offers some really good food. You just might want to eat inside. I will definitely go here again!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great spot to hang after a long day at the beach. There are a lot of families enjoying the space but there is an adult section where you can enjoy a local beer or glass of wine with out the whine.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Great location especially if you have kids.  Mediocre food.  Plus, lots of variety and options, average prices."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place especially on a sunny day. Great food, picnic seating outside, family atmosphere. Parking is horrible!! can't express it enough. But well worth the hassle as the food is good and it's a great place to enjoy a sunny day :)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Loved the food and most importantly, the atmosphere. We had a great time letting our kids play in the sandbox as we soaked up the sun. 

An outdoor bar would have gotten me to purchase more drinks."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Great location, excellent outdoor area but no dogs allowed even at the spacious outdoor area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Very nice location, and that is what you are paying for.  the food is mediocre at best, overpriced and the portions are small.  

I had their shrimp salad and my husband had their grilled fish tacos.  the shrimp salad was mostly lettuce with a few small shrimp and the usual onions and tomatoes.  I found it unsatisfying for the price.  the fish tacos were not worth the ten dollars they cost.  they were each about 2 bites and French fries would have cost extra.. We both left hungry and thirty dollars poorer"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The outside seating area makes this place one of a kind. It's a good place to kids to run around on the grass and also play in the sandbox. As far as the food, it was delicious. I got the fish tacos and my gf got the grilled chicken sandwich. The tortillas for the tacos were great and it was a solid size fish filet. 2 fish tacos and comes with a side of chips n salsa for $9. The fish n chips looked great too and the salads were big portions. Definitely recommend this place!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,My favorite lunch spot in Santa Barbara! Been going here with my family for years! A truly fun and unique outdoor eating experience. Great for all ages. Their hickory burger is one of my favorite burgers in California. Also some of the best onion rings and sweet potato fries I have every had. It's also right next to the beautiful Santa Clause Beach!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I try and stop here anytime I am driving up the coast. Good moderately priced fast casual food but the reason to stop here is to sit out at a picnic table on the cool green lawn and gaze out at the ocean. So relaxing to either celebrate your escape from So Cal traffic or as the last bit of vacation before heading back to reality.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great spot to relax after the beach and to watch the sunset.  Food and great beers on taps. Worth a stop.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Went to this restaurant and was thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere. It's a great place for families with the sand pit and toys, but also a great place to take your girlfriend because they have an Adults Only seating area the has a phenomenal view of the beach with live music playing in the background. As for the food itself, it was good, nothing spectacular, but well worth the price. I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to going back again. Another thing too is that they don't have a parking lot or a valet so you have to park on the street outside... which is common in this part of California, but with me coming from Las Vegas, it's kind of a pain.

Atmosphere - 5+
Food - 4
Service - 3"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I'm very comfortable open air place to have a terrific beach meal. The food is fantastic. It's hard to decide what to choose from when you see your choices. Our party had the fish tacos both grilled and Baja, salad with chicken, fish and chips and fish sandwich. My only regret is that I didn't try a hamburger as well!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Such a great spot. Fun atmosphere, picnic style, order at the counter and wait for your food to be called. The food is always fresh and good."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place to get a burger and overlook the beach and ocean. You place your order and are given a buzzer. When ready you just go to counter. The prices are very reasonable. We ordered a hickory burger and the trio which is some shoestring fries, sweet potato fries and a few large onion rings. They also offer sandwiches and salads. So much food we shared the burger. The food was delicious.  You can sit indoors, or out in the patio area or on picnic tables overlooking the water. It truly has the feel like you're at someone's home. Great place for kids too. Glad we stopped here. When in the area we will definitely stop in again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a cute little piece of heaven!  The barbecue salad was delicious and all the kids and hubby love their food, location is great, and it's a pretty cool pitstop on the way to Santa Barbara."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Excellent restaurant to grab a fresh sandwich, a cold brew, while enjoying the beautiful Carpintería climate. You'll have the option to eat outdoors, 20-30 yards from the waves. I'm coming back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wow this place was such a refreshing surprise!

Food was amazing and the wonderful outside setting right by the ocean was just what we needed.

Kids had fun in the sandbox while my wife and I enjoyed a cool refreshing break from the road.

The burgers are unbelievable to!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Delicious menu and great beers on tap! The location is great if you're looking to be outside and enjoy the sun and ocean breeze. Everything I've ever had here has been tasty. I've had their salads, sandwiches and keep going back for their Baja style fish tacos!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The California Burger is one of my favorite burgers. Their buns are perfection. The avocado is always spot on. The food comes out fast and the service has always been friendly. I think the burgers are really reasonably priced for the area too. Great outdoor seating. You can hear the waves!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Traveling in a large group is fun, but not when it comes to finding a good restaurant with enough sitting.  Fortunately, if that's your challenge, then this spot is for you.

Located next to the 101 freeway, this location offers great food and drinks at affordable pricing.  Great for families with children.  We stopped by on Sunday.  Line moved fast and ordered our food.  

4 stars on food:  Burgers are well cooked, sandwiches are also a good choice.  Draft beers are  on point.

5-stars on sitting:  this spot has a large sitting area with wooden benches.  The atmosphere is awesome."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"We really wanted to love this place. We heard it was great and it came highly recommended for kids since we are traveling with a 4 year old. The location is very close to the beach and they have a completely fenced area with sandbox for kids to play, which is very cool. That being said, it's street parking and we had to park about a quarter of a mile away and we waited in line for almost 30 minutes. This was not easy with a toddler. The food selection was nice. The burger was smaller than expected and the salad, while good, wasn't extraordinary. The Baja fish tacos were good and the chips were awesome. The line for the bathrooms was almost as long as the food line and the bathrooms were relatively clean for being used so much. We would go back, but if you are in a hurry or have young toddlers, you may want to check out the line before committing."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The view and the beachy vibe is my favorite part about this place. The expensive mediocre food is not. Its a great place to stop on your way home from SB or Solvang, but honestly, it can be a zoo. Parking is horrible, and it's usually so busy. Waiting in line for food can take forever, and if you have to go to the bathroom, the wait there is even longer. I've come a few times, and this past Saturday we came, and I was immediately grossed out by all the flies flying around where the food is made. Come for a drink, enjoy the view, let your kids play in the sand, but don't look for some amazing food to come out of it. Very sub par."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"If you are seeking a nice place to hangout with the family and relax this is the place.  The atmosphere is very casual and family oriented and being right next to the ocean lends itself to a truly relaxing experience.  Also, the food is great and the prices are reasonable.  The only real issue is with parking, but who wants to eat an an empty restaurant?  All in all, a great location with excellent food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"This place is so cute and you feel like you're in hawaii and then, the food!  Well at least the burgers which are a pretty big staple of the menu - blow!  I mean frozen patties WTF!?!?  So I had a turkey burger my friend had a burger and both were well, obviously cooked from frozen.  Just soooo not what you'd expect froma place that looks as awesome as this does!  Really kinda baffled!  The nacho's were ok, nothing to write home about and the sweet potato fries were, well, a little frozen!  I dont mean like ""cold"" just obvious they werent made fresh and that's what the place evokes - fresh!  So go for the beer, the wine and maybe something battered??  Maybe stuff that tastes ok pre-made/frozen would fair better with exepectations or just adjust your taste buds and enjoy the ambiance and forget about the food!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"One word review - BETTER.

Much better! Don't get me wrong, I ate there pretty regularly when the food was sub par and overpriced but now they got me for the long haul. 

The facility has really been upgraded...much cleaner, lighter and brighter. They still have the best location. The kept the sandbox. That is a big plus for us. 

The food has also been vastly improved! The moment you walk in you can tell that the new owners are trying much harder in this department than the previous owners. There used to be a staff of 2 or 3 in the kitchen but you can clearly see a much larger kitchen staff upon walking through the front door! I think I counted 7 in the kitchen not including cashiers/expeditors. 

The menu is pretty simple and they are using quality ingredients. I had the fish and chips....delicious. perfectly fried and not greasy at all. The wife had the bbq chicken salad. She loved it. Good sized portion. Tender chicken, fresh veggies. 

The prices are much more reasonable since the reopen as well. Lunch for 3 adults and 1 child...and 2 beers (pretty decent tap selection) for under $50. Easily $70 before....no joke. 

The most surprising improvement was the service. The model of ordering at the counter and waiting for the buzzer to let you know when your food is ready doesn't really give the staff much of a chance to shine. The cashiers were super friendly and knew how to deal with a crowd. There were bussers and general staff spending quite a bit of time roaming the grounds...a very nice addition. The old management pretty much wrote you off once you got your food and went outside. 

All in all, a much needed facelift with improvements in every aspect of the business. All while maintaining (and improving) all of the charming features that made this place a great pit stop for traveling families and a favorite for locals!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Road side beach restaurant. Easy on/off from freeway. Hubby love his burger and helped me with my Nachos. Pleasant indoor space to dine, but huge outdoor dining  with sand pit for kids. Adult only area raised seeting for view of ocean. Nachos had just the right mix of chips & cheese, YUMMY."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"First off we loved the ambiance here! It felt like we were in Hawaii. Great family atmosphere but loved the adult only patio. Do know that this is not a full service restaurant. You order at the counter and pick up your own food, but that didn't bother us. The Baja fish tacos were great, as were the sweet potato fries. The shrimp and avocado salad was pretty solid, but didn't knock my socks off."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"One star for the view only. Tacos were dry served on a cold tortilla. We used to love coming here many years ago but not anymore. In fact, service is so bad one of the workers bumped into me and I almost knocked my tray over. Not only did he not say sorry, he looked back and laughed. We will never go here again!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a wonderful surprise this place is. We just happened to stop by for a lunch break and ended up falling in love with the location, food and service!
Plenty of inside seating and more than enough room outside for enjoying scenery and beautiful weather!
The only improvement I'd suggest would be more bathrooms! There is one set of ""regular"" bathrooms inside and a couple porta-potties outside!
We will make this a regular stop in the future!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,O trem passa ao lado deste restaurante proprio pra ir com crianças! Fomos com a turma da escola e curtimos o local! Tem areia pra as crianças brincarem!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Im glad I found this place because of the location and also because when I went there was like nobody there and i hate packed restaurants and etc. Its so beautiful eating outside they have picnic tables and you can see the ocean which is great, but the food was ehhh..not worth it."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Perfect place to stop with the kids on the way to  or from SB.  The sand put for the kids was a hit.  They sell beer as wine too!  Only negative was that I didn't love the fish tacos- not enough fish, too much lettuce."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I love this place! The food is delicious. I usually get the teriyaki chicken sandwich. Make sure to get it on a brioche bun. Bomb! I also love the location such a fun atmosphere.  Highly recommend it!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fish tacos, shrimp tacos and a kids meal--all amazing.   Parking was a challenge but the patio/picnic area is totally worth the stop.  Add great food and you have a new family tradition when we go to the beach.  No reason to bring lunch!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Pretty decent food, yummy tacos, pretty tasty tuna melt- a classic burger, beer & fries joint. Their greatest jewels are their excellent ocean views, gigantic sandbox for the kids to play in while the adults get to relax amongst other adults, and great live music (beach music)! Had a great time and fun in the sun, you will too!

In contrast to the very poor food at other beach front food shacks in the Shoreline beach area, the food here is pretty good and beer selection good too.
Enjoy!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This was their first week open and it has been raining all weekend. Despite that my wife and I decided to brave the elements and give it a try. The location has had three owners over the 15 years that I have been going there and I think these folks got it right. The burgers were great and the service was efficient and friendly.

In addition to great burgers they have almost an acre of landscaped grounds that offer not only a variety of spots to sit and enjoy your food but also a playground for the kids and the background to all of this is the Pacific Ocean.

We will be coming back soon and bringing our Grandkids."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fabulous food, location, and space (on the beach, a lot of green space, and with a sandbox for kids to play) on the beach.  Food options are simple and clean.  5 star rating!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great burgers, fish and chips are the best.  Outdoor seating really gives you the beach dining feeling.  We are locals and love this place"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"great food, good prices, pleasant atmosphere. the lemonade is AMAZING. everyone has always been nice except for one person, a younger female cashier, who seemed unhappy that we'd come 15 minutes before they were closed (even though the hours weren't posted on the door). however, i will not let that experience bias us too much, this place is quality."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"They really didn't have to offer me more than a huge sandpit with sand toys for my kids to play in while hubby and I ate... But, they also provided us with amazing fish and chips and a truly juicy and delicious burger.  

This was our first time that we are planning on making this our go to whenever we are in town."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Staff was nice food presentation beautiful, my husband and I got burgers, the meat was over cooked hard like a puck covered nicely with the cheese and condiments, my girls salads were amazing."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Atmosphere: everything a parent could wish for. Kid tables. Sandbox(huge)
Food was great. Watch for seagulls. They will dive at your food if you get up for a second."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"If you are looking for a place to have a fantastic lunch or dinner this is your place. You can eat inside or out. Most people choose to eat out because the grounds are lovely and overlook the ocean. This is definitely a family friendly environment. There are children playing in the gigantic sand area and running through the pretty green grass. The hamburgers are giant, the salads are amazing, and the sweet potato fries and onion rings are delicious."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Kid friendly, great food and awesome location. I plan on coming here whenever I make a trip to this area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Cool place for kids and grown ups.  Huge sand pit for the kids to play in while the adults socialize.  Food was good too!  Awesome fire pit!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome spot, nice views, good burgers. What else is there to say."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Good food and drink. Great for young kids.  Definitely a go-to spot on those warm summer days.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Fantastic spot right on the beach. The food was decent but the setting is spectacular. Big sand pit for the kids to play in too. Would definitely go back for the view.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Amazing setting. The quality of the food was superb. Everything our family ordered was cooked to perfection and delicious. Shrimp tacos, topped with the cabbage and sauce and huge serving of avocado, were a highlight as were the sweet potato fries. Little guys loved the sand play area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great family restaurant, can't beat the outdoor seating and proximity to the ocean. Grass and sand for the kids to play. Excellent"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Great location, grassy area and sand pit for children.  Good view of ocean. The food, however, was average. Cold fish in tacos,  a huge pile of unnecessary chips to fill up plate. Burger was ok.  

Good for a group when weather is good because of picnic tables and plenty of space."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I was in my way to Lompoc CA when I Yelped something along the beach with a nice view. I ended up in the perfect spot!

It's a park like lounge type of ambiance very chill. The seating is only outside but they have plenty of benches and an included lounge area, they have a huge fire pit outside in the patio and the view is beautiful, lots of trees and plants and grass. They also have a sand pit for kids. I went on a Saturday and they were hosting a wedding and a baby shower. 

I ordered the club sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries and a Rosè. I enjoyed every bite and fry. Perfect scenery ambiance and food. I definitely will be back to try the rest of the menu."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I like Padaro Grill for the food and the atmosphere both, it's a rare kind of place. I was there today and ordered the captains platter which is fried fish, shrimp, calamari, coleslaw and fries.

 The seafood was good, but there was hardly any. I got two small pieces of fish about 3 inches long and an inch wide. The shrimp were small to medium, I got three or 4. The calamari were good, but again there were very few. The coleslaw didn't have any flavor. 

The majority of the platter was fries. Granted, it was good (except the coleslaw), but disappointing not to get more seafood. The tarter sauce was exceptionally good. Good presentation of the food as well, fast service too."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Crap food. I ordered a shrimp sandwich and they put two baby shrimps on the entire thing. The only thing good about this place is your kids can run around while you have a beer. Food is crap.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Me and my lover boy took a trip down to Carpinteria on a fine Thursday afternoon and decided to eat at this place. We both ordered the Albacore Fish Burger and let me tell you, it's got to be the best burger I've ever eaten. I normally never order fish burgers but since we were adventurous that day, I ordered it and did not regret it one bit! 

The Albacore was ordered medium rare but was received medium well, but it turned out perfect because the texture and taste was delicious. After-all we did order a fish burger and not a sashimi burger. The albacore was set on top of lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and a house sauce that tickled our fancy. Considering how big the burger was, bubba finished it unbelievably fast which means he really liked it. Oh! We both thought this place was going to be pricey because of the seating they provide, but two fish burgers, sweet potato fries, and a drink only costed us $24 worth of damage and no tip! :) How Asian am I that I get excited when I don't have to tip?! 

I am glad we had a chance to try this place. The view was absolutely breath-taking. It totally made our dining experience a whole lot more relaxing and (prepare for barfage), romantic. Everything was perfect! We got there right before they started to get packed and left right when the packed started to pack. (We got there around 5pm?)

Point of review: If you're in dire need of a getaway from reality, throw on a hot spankin bathing suit or whatever makes you feel sexy, hop in your drop top, cruise down PCH towards Carpinteria, and grab a bite to eat here."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"We were pleased to find the Padaro Beach Grill, on our last visit to Carpinteria.

The food was of good quality, and we enjoyed it. The chicken Caesar salad was good - though a bit small. The fish and chips were also quite good, as was the grilled cheese (hard to mess up a grilled cheese). 

The ambiance was nice, and it's a good place to bring the kids on a nice afternoon and eat outside in the ""picnic style"" seating just off the beach. Because it's a beach-front location, I understand that the costs for the owner are higher than other real estate. Therefore, don't expect as great of a value in terms of the food as other non-beachfront location could afford to offer. But, I think the ownership has done a great job with provided good-quality items at a price that (all things considered) is a very good value.

However, we had a bad experience with one item of food; the shrimp tacos. They came with a LOT of salad (cabbage, etc) and VERY LITTLE shrimp. In fact my wife was shocked. She said, ""where's the shrimp""? So she took the tacos back to the counter to inquire. She was told, ""we put five shrimp between the two tacos"" and didn't offer to fix anything! So, needless to say, she came back to the table a bit surprised.

She decided not to eat the tacos and to get her money back. So after the meal she brought the plate back and asked for a refund. The manager told her that she'd remake the tacos for her in a to-go box (since we were ready to leave), and also gave her a card for free tacos on our next visit. So far, so good! 

When the tacos came out my wife looked and they were EXACTLY THE SAME as the ones she'd complained about (5 shrimp between the two taco)! She asked about this, and the manager said, ""Oh yes, we didn't put any extra shrimp"". 

My wife had already spent more time discussing this with the manager than is important to include here, and at that point my wife was exhausted with the whole situation. She just left the shrimp and the card and walked out.

I'm not a retail or restaurant manager, but if someone was unhappy with a food item I sold -- I would not make it exactly as they had been unhappy with and give it to them a second time! 

My wife would have been more than happy with either a different item, the same item with more shrimp and/or less cabbage, or a refund. But she didn't get any of the 3! Oh well..."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Excellent food & customer service. THE best Cali atmosphere for a young family. I had the Baja tacos & sweet potato fries and I love that the kids meals have a salad option!! I can't wait to bring out of town friends n family.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place to go with kids, the sand pit is awesome. The food is solid but the atmosphere is the real winner. It's always nice to go to a place that caters to kids parents and anyone looking to enjoy a burger by the beach."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Fabulous shrimp tacos! Makes you wanna slap your cousin! BBQ salad was also very good. Relaxing atmosphere. Good customer service.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Love this place. Great food at low prices and the ambiance is amazing. A must stop! We love the outside patio. The kids can eat and run around as you watch the sunset or the train go by. Nice staff and the burgers are the bomb!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Most definitely a fan. How can you not like this place?
Fantastic view of the ocean and hills? Check.
Steps away from soft, sandy beach? Check.
Same Habit/ hook burger menu at same prices elsewhere? Check.
Good beer selection botteled or draft? Check.
Super lush and chill patio and garden? Double check.
My burger and sweet potato fries were just as good as other hook burger locations."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome place to stop, especially if you have kids.
Fresh tacos, giant sandbox with toys. Supa cool."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I love this place!Great burgers and great prices! Right on the beach.Tropical atmosphere.What more can I say a gem of a find
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We tried the burger and sweet potato fries. Also had the fish and chips we read about in previous reviews. Loved the food! Loved the beach atmosphere! The quantity and quality of the food for the price was awesome. Loved that the train rolled by (for 2 seconds) We would defiantly return. Very kid friendly
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I am so in love with this place! I've been living in Ventura for almost 2 years now and my friend recommended my boyfriend and I should go here. I'm so glad I did. The food is amazing and very reasonably priced. The view is breathtaking and the ambience is very beach cozy. I wish I took a picture of the food but we ate it so fast I didn't think twice. But I did manage to take a pic of the beautiful view. I highly recommend and it's perfect if you have anyone visiting that you wanna take somewhere that has that beach view vibe. Oh and they have pitchers too
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,First visit. Lunch time had the pretzel burger with sweet potato fries. Very tasty. Outstanding location with great view. Will return.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I was going on a day trip to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles for my birthday... I found this place on yelp and we stopped for brunch on the way to Santa Barbara. The place was SO CUTE! We got so much food for $20 and sat out on the awesome dining grassy area while enjoying an ocean view! The food was 10/10 as well, super affordable! So glad we stopped, we would totally be back again. The workers and other costumers were happy and friendly. Afterwards we took a walk on the beach from a beach access area just up the way."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,5 in terms of ambiance and entertainment! The food was average. Loved the benches next it the ocean!!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Tried the Baja fish tacos they were fresh and yummy! We added a salad and split both between two.. perfect!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great place for adults and kids. Second time here. Had the hickory burger with fries and onion rings. I like how the place opens up for the kids to play.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Awesome burgers! Really nice atmosphere to sit and enjoy a beer and burger. They give a generous portion of fries with the very nicely dressed up burgers. The toppings are just fabulous.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Buyer beware: when we go to a food establishment where you order at a counter, pick up your own food and trash, my tips come in the form of cash for a tip jar based upon how friendly the cashier is. The cashier that helped us was unfriendly and no smile, so you can imagine what my tip would have been. However, upon leaving and looking over our receipt, it appears she gave herself a $5.00 tip on our credit card. As far as the food goes, the grilled fish tacos were bland. The tri-tip sandwich was just ok. On a positive note, the sweet potato fries were really good, and the outdoor seating was pretty cool. That's why they got at least 2 stars. Check your receipts early and bring it up to the manager."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place to eat with your family. Kids love the big sand box with toys and grown ups like the food and beverages including beer!

Watch out for all the birds though."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Such a great spot! This place is delicious and is perfect for families. What's not to love about yummy food and a beautiful spot on the beach. We love it here! Highly recommend! :)
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Absolutely wonderful place by the beach. Great food and place to relax. Sand pit is perfect for the kids to have plenty of fun too.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The ambiance of this place is very beach casual and chill. Very child friendly with a large sand area to play - they provide the sand toys :). I enjoy spending an afternoon or evening here with my family. It's a great place that no one worries about children having fun playing. 

Food is average. I like the nachos the best. The veggie burger is good. My children like the quesadilla with fries. Sweet potato fries are good. I have been told the beef burger are really good I haven't tried them yet. I wish they had gluten free hamburger buns for my family members who need them. 

I will be back again and again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great hickory burger and beach club sandwich.  Wait wasn't long on a Friday around lunchtime and nice grassy area and sand pit for kids to play.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"New Years night there were 9 of our family members that walked into The Padaro Beach Grill with only 30 minutes before closing and the staff  was very welcoming and kind!!!  Erica said it would be ""no problem"" and please order and take a table.  
The food was FABULOUS and the price was exceptionally reasonable!!  

We live nearby and we are sold!  We will be back again and again!!!

Thank you for opening again for business and we will tell EVERYONE!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food was cooked well, the back dining off the pacific is beautiful. Staff was friendly. Wish they had some more creative dishes. Just your average burger/Mexican joint. It would be a 3 if it wasn't for the great location."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Oceanfront, park-like setting with a small pond and large sand box play area for children surrounded by grass. Abundance of picnic tables and grass umbrellas. Burgers, chicken, fish, shrimp, large salads, shakes, beer and a children's menu. Everything cooked to perfection. A short line to order on a January Saturday for lunch -- an electronic pager notifies you when your food is ready. (Expect crowds in the summer months.)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great for kids! They can play in the sandbox & have plenty of space to just relax! My kids are super picky but LOVED the chicken tenders! All fish is locally caught, too!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely incredible food at great prices. inside out California burger, sweet potato fries and cole slaw totally hit the spot after a hike at Romero Canyon. This place has a ton of character too -- right on the water, with picnic bench seating. I wish there were a place like this back home!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Got the shrimp tacos and the were super delish! I loved the patio view. Had a relaxing time and enjoyed amazing food!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great place to eat if you have kids. Beautiful outdoor seating & very good food. The staff is very on it & always get our orders correct & are so friendly!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The seating here is 95% outdoors. The few seats that are indoors are about the same temperature as the outdoors because all the doors are kept open. 

Salmon sandwich - 4 stars. Not bad if you're in the mood for salmon. Tasty brioche bun. Comes with tartar sauce. 

The trio (fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries) - 3.5 stars. 
- Onion rings were delicious. 
- Fries were pretty good too. 
- Sweet potato fries weren't crispy enough but had good flavor. 

The only seats where you can enjoy the ocean view are either up on the elevated deck or the bar seats along the back of the property. 

There is a sand area where kids can have play and get super sandy. 

There is an occasional train due to the tracks that run immediately adjacent to the back of the property. Yes, this is loud, but the two that came by while we were eating were thankfully very short trains."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great Burger Place!!!!!This was the first time I have ever been here. The atmosphere was great. Who can complain about eating with an ocean view? I had their house chili, if you are looking for a chili that is meat friendly here it is. My friend had the Padaro burger, wow! This is where I will come for burgers in the future. I will definitely be coming back, for the burger!!!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"You haven't eaten here???  Fix that NOW!!!! This place rocks...food, atmosphere, all of it.  Favorite spot when driving along the coast."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"One word: Amazeballs!

I ordered the seared ahi on salad (see pic) ... you can see by my picture the ahi was a meal in itself.... made even better by the delicious salad! The ahi was seared to perfection! I even ordered sweet potato fries... which by the way, seem to be ""seasoned"" with brown sugar... oh my goodness YUM!

I came here on a whim and was more than pleasantly surprised... the food was tasty and fresh, the restaurant was clean as was the table I sat on. 

I can see that a lot of traveling folks on the 101 probably stop here... I saw a lot of families with children running around and the kids were having a blast.

Thank you, Padaro Beach Grill for a wonderful lunch!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My mom and I love finding new places to go and I think we just found a new favorite! The food was phenomenal and came out quickly. I didn't know what I was walking into when we went to eat outside...but it was breathtaking! There are picnic tables, a sand area for the kids, an adult only patio with a big fire pit, and it's right on the ocean. Do yourself a favor and enjoy a lunch here."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Location, Location, Location.... if you are anywhere near Carpinteria and want a burger with onion rings, a cool breeze and a view... this is the place!

The food is every bit as good as ""The Spot"" and the view is definitely better.... the only problem is you have to leave town to get there... a small price to pay for a lunch you and your family will remember!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Stopped by this place on our way back from Santa Barbara. First time. Very impressed with what we had - grilled fish tacos and a Hawaiian burger. Both were excellent. Will come back again.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great stop along 101 with quality food! Ambience was perfect for a sunny day. Pets allowed on grass area before you go over bridge, so if you have a dog, grab a table there."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We loved this place so much that we stopped on the way up the coast then on our way back down.  The location is beautiful and the food is very good.  I highly recommend this grill.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"5-star ambiance, 3-star food.

This is located right on the Beach at Santa Claus Ln. You can simply park alongside the road in a free-for-all or try to grab one of the few parking spots in from of the restaurant.

Once inside, there is an open-air queue area to order, but seating is mostly outside. In fact, they have so much outdoor seating it is practically a park with grass, picnic tables, umbrellas for shade, a fish pond, tropical landscaping, and even a sandbox for kids. However, this huge outdoor area is puzzlingly not dog-friendly. 

There is a simple menu with unique sounding burgers and seafood tacos. You order at the front, pay, and then grab a buzzer. Craft beer on tap was a nice surprise. I went with the fire-roasted chili burger and sweet potato fries. The food was extremely average like the kind you would expect from say a poolside restaurant inside a resort. Nothing was bad or great, just middle of the road.

I think the real draw here is the ambiance. Kids can run around while you can get out of the sun and relax with some food and beer after some quality time at the beach. Other than that, I would not go specifically out of my way to eat here."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"You cannot beat the location or outdoor atmosphere. It's gorgeous here! Food is good here but what I remember most is sitting outside, enjoying the view from the (adults only) patio and having a glass of wine. This is for sure a tucked away treasure. The menu has something for everyone. You order at a counter which is fine for me. It's nice a casual. They even have a play area for kids-I'll stick to the adult patio though"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is great! Super laid back, good food, an amazing outdoor seating area that basically feels like you're eating in a park. Grassy, with lots of trees, ocean front, space for kids to run around and play and lots of seating options in the shade and sun."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I have nothing but great things to say about this Gem!!! My boyfriend and I were looking for a place with a beach view to eat lunch on a Monday afternoon. Stumbled upon this place. First off the atmosphere is so inviting and relaxing! Picnic tables in the sun some with shade and a sand pit in the middle for the kids to enjoy. 

We ordered the hickory burger, shrinp tacos with sweet potato fries, coleslaw and a side salad. It all tasted fresh!! The cream sauce on the shrimp tacos was creamy and refreshing. The 1000 island tasted home made and went well with the fries. 

Especially with kids this place got 5 stars, we were able to enjoy lunch while the kids played in the sun! 

Added surprise was the train that drove right by! My son loved it!!! 

I can only imagine the sunsets at this spot!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great for big parties!! Good food. They cater parties. overlooks the ocean
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Cute little place right on the shore. It has several outdoor picnic tables on large grassy areas, shaded by easy-ups, a few indoor tables or you can just eat picnic style on the grass. There is a big sandbox area for the kids to play in, as well as ponds and flowers adding to the quaint ambiance. 

The food was very good. We had the turkey burger, shrimp & avocado salad (delish), prime cheeseburgers, fish tacos, coleslaw, onion rings, regular & sweet potato fries...everything was yummy! We seated our party of 9, easily, at one picnic table. The staff was very nice and attentive. It's counter style ordering, but they had staff cleaning off your table and looking after things regularly. 

This place is perfect for families, but they do have an adults only section, for non-kid people to sit and have a beer in peace. My only somewhat negative, was they only have 2 single toilets, mens/womens, so there was a line of about 5 people to go to the bathroom the whole time we were there. Also, parking on this street is super packed because of all the beach parking, but we did find a spot. After you eat you can walk right to the beach.

IMHO this is a must for anyone with younger kids, but even with our teens it was an enjoyable spot to eat. We will definitely go back and recommend it to others."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place! 
Great outdoor seating, great food (the hamburgers are awesome), and good prices for Carp! 

Granted parking can be a hassle, but it's worth it for this place. We just discovered this a few months ago, but the food is wonderful and everybody loved it. (Burgers and Salads were our choices)

I could definitely see myself coming here for my next birthday for a small get together!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The best place in Carpinteria! Great atmosphere on the beach and excellent food. My favorite spot to take family and friends
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Family of 5 came here for dinner during our stay in Carpinteria. Good food all around, priced reasonably and pleasant atmosphere in the large outdoor seating area. Only issue was the couple of trains that pass very close, but noisy only for a couple minutes. Would certainly return if we're in the area again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,The food is great but they do not allow dogs in their outdoor area.  Its a beach restaurant you have to allow dogs.  Most places today with an outside eating area allows dogs.  They have a huge outdoor area the least they could do is have a area set aside for dog people.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I absolutely love love it here it such a fun ambience with the picnic tables overlooking the  ocean water i've been coming here at least once a year with my daughter & family  for 10 years it is great for kid's & family's of all age's
Everything is good here i love the burgers & fries & my absolute favorite thing on the menu is there calamari it is sooo mouth watering
Bottom Line: an awesome place to spend an afternoon hanging with family & or friends are just by your self"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"LOVED this place!! Excellent food for an extremely reasonable price. My burger was excellent and my husbands ahi sandwich looked amazing. My in-laws got fish tacos which also looked amazing. Wonderful craft beer selection! 

There's plenty of outdoor seating and a play area/sandbox for the little ones. Lots of space for them to run around.

There was a great view of the ocean and beach access as well! Can't say enough wonderful things about this place!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Kid friendly and tasty.  And, they serve beer.  We are in heaven.  Mommy and Daddy can sit and talk while the boys play.  Why don't more restaruants have outdoor eating/play area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Parking can get tricky during the summer and especially the weekend. So you enter the restaurant, wait in line, order food, pay first, get a buzzer (like The Habit), find a seat outside (benches to bar-style counters with stools as seats overlooking the Pacific Ocean), when the food is ready your buzzer will buzzzzzzzzz, carry your foody food back to your loving wife, eat, drink beer, take photos of the scenic view, finish your food, and leave happy. 

This place is perfect for families since there's grass and sand for kids to play on. Take your date here for a nice taco or two. But yah this place is cool in my book."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I would say this place was good, not great. The menu is a fairly good size. Burgers, sandwiches, tacos and beer and wine. I ordered the Baka fish tacos and was actually pretty disappointed in what I got. 2 small tacos with small pieces of fish. Tortillas were so soggy from the pico de gallo that when I picked up my taco the tortilla ripped. It came it a mound of chips. It seems like we payed 9.25 for chips. My boyfriend ordered the prime burger. He said it was cooked well, the only thing was the patty could have been bigger. I think the next time we come here I'll try ordering something other then the tacos."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We tried this place out yesterday after a polo match nearby at Santa Barbara polo club. The atmosphere was amazing and very dog friendly on the patio. We felt  Like we were in Hawaii from the looks of it. The food quality was very high and relaxed. We will be back when in town.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"They really have outstanding water cups. Most places give you those little tiny ones that you can't fit anything in, but not Padaro. Definitely recommend checking them out (and getting a water cup)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Really good food. Great atmosphere! I would definitely eat here again and recommend this. Had the fish and chips and it was really good. The batter was light and the fries were good as well.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Yummy food in a beautiful location. The Beach Club Sandwiches were delish as were the onion rings... will be back
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great location. Benches outside for a great outdoor location. There is a small area outside for ocean-view dining too. The food is good too. Had a delicious veggie burger (they cook their veggie patties on a separate grill). My friends had fish and chips and said they liked it.  
The only negative is that there are birds (sea gulls) around. 
The place has a few tables inside as well. 
Very clean and pleasant."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great atmosphere.  Been there many times and enjoyed it.  Just wish they allowed dogs again.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My best friends and I have been coming to this Wonderful place for almost 3 years now. Whenever we have a chance to get together, we drive all the way from Northridge just to have their Tuna sandwich and Turkey Burger with Sweet potato fries. This place is a good place to come & relax in nature. The food is great, the people who works there are very helpful, always with their smile and are very polite. We consider this place ""our little piece of heaven"". It's a totally family place. We just hope someday there will be live music, since there are 2 stages at the picnic bench area. Keep up the good job. And as for us...we will keep coming, we were just there today."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,What a great spot in the beach! We were on our way to Pismo Beach and stumbled across this gem with amazing food ( Baja fish tacos & Fish / Chips pictured) and wonderful ambiance for families. It's definitely a must try!!!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Remarkable food with beach access for the whole family, flip flops acceptable.  You step up to the counter, order, get a number and bus you own food to a table inside or out.  The locals know about this place and really love it just as we did on our first visit.  Highly recommended.  Probably good enough to drive from Santa Barbara to eat here.  Local beer on tap, kids are more than welcome."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped by on a day trip to Santa Barbara based on a friend's recommendation. It was a beautiful day & the ample outdoor seating provided a nice view of the Pacific while we had our burgers, beers & wine. The food was pretty good (fish tacos were fresh & tasty) & I liked the chardonnay they had on tap. The only thing I'd ding them for was the woman who took my order - she was not friendly at all! No greeting, no friendliness, etc. There were 3 of us who each ordered at different times & we all agreed she was pretty cold/unfriendly etc. Not the best introduction to a new spot but I'd come back to enjoy the food & view."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I have attended events as well as stopped by for a casual lunch. Food is great!!! Service terrific! And it's right on the beach. Can't beat it. Lunch, dinner, a family get together or even a company event, it is the perfect spot. The owners Will and Anne are hands on and make sure that everything is just right. A+"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Felt like a slice of heaven on this winters January evening. Delightful little nook outside with epic heat flames and one of the best burgers (pretzel bread, add lettuce & tomato) & chili we've ever had. Perfect in every way. Ordered another burger for the road. Amazing prices. Changing table for babies in restroom. Bravo bravo!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Padaro is a great choice for lunch on a nice day - ample patio and a sand pit for kids to play in. It's by the beach but you can't really see the water due to a fence which works because occasionally the Amtrak will go by. Its a great pick for large groups as there are plenty of seating areas. Food is average and comes out fairly quickly/ service is decent - location and beauty outside make the place.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The food is fine. The real reason to go there is the oceanfront views. This place would be great for a party or larger group in good weather.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Everything about this gem of a spot was perfectly wonderful! Went on Kelly Slaters recommendation and we're sure glad we did.. the food, the service, the grounds and view. A must go when in Carpentaria"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I cannot wait to go back. Not only was the food amazing, but the location is absolutely breathtaking. Definitely family oriented. The only problem I had was the two girls in the front (cashier) were not so friendly. Kind of a bummer but the place was too amazing for that to ruin our experience! 100% recommend"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place to stop for a quick bite while driving up the coast. However - beware if you are planning to go here for a bathroom break - there was just one stall and a huge line of people to use it, including people who seemed to be just hanging out at the beach and/or looking for a place to change.  My bf was able to line up, order food, and have it brought out before I made it to the front of the bathroom line. Definitely a beach spot vs a sit down spot, so adjust expectations accordingly.

That being said, the tacos were great!  I had the grilled fish tacos and onion rings.  The burgers and sandwiches looked good as well, but I can't opine as I only had the tacos."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My friend and I stopped here en route to an alpaca farm and were pleasantly surprised.  We ordered the Padaro burger and chili cheese fries at the counter and headed outside where there's a nice shaded area under the trees/awning, a little bridge with a sand pit for kids to play in, and a larger picnic area.  We got to enjoy our delicious food overlooking a beautiful ocean view - although the fries could use a bit more chili.  Would come again!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great spot!  Right next to the water.  Perfect place to watch the sunset and walk on the beach.  Fish tacos were delicious, as were the fish and chips.  Great for kids, but thankfully they also have an adults-only section which is a nice break from the crazy munchkins."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Very cool vibe, especially in the summer. On weekends it can be packed with families so be aware because it won't be quite as relaxing. I had some tacos and they were great. A friend had some kind of salad that was huge and reportedly delicious. I would go back."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place! Order the Padaro burger (not on the menu) and you will not be disappointed. Great juicy burger with crunchy onion ring, bacon, BBQ sauce and an avocado for extra $.50. Get a cold one to go with it too!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great experience! First time today at sunset. We had our two small children enjoying themselves in the sand while my wife and I ate. In particular, just after setting our food down, a flock of seagulls came and devoured our food. After explaining what happened, the staff agreed to cook us new food, and did so with a smile.  Thank you! Can't beat the view."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great ocean view restaurant. Very relax atmosphere with lots of kids around. They actually have an adult only seating section. Beware during busy dinning hours. Lines can be long...but, well worth the wait. Only complaint was my burger was warm/cold."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Family friendly, great food, great price and wonderful outdoor atmosphere. A local favorite."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome! Great food, great prices, great outdoor seating. I've been here several times and each time we have loved the food and atmosphere.

Get the Fish sandwich, you will not be disappointed. 
We have tried the burgers, the fish tacos, sides, all good all the time!

The real Foodie 
Loving Padaro Beach Grill"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Got the beach chicken sandwich really good. The fries not all that exciting could improve 
The place is kid friendly u could leave the kids on the sand with the toys they have while you eat or drink a brew really nice place to chill"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great menu! Something for everyone! I have good friends that are vegans and meat eaters alike!! Also love the area for children and even an area that says adults only! Lots of options for seating! Food is amazing!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Love this place!  We can come here early on a Sunday and have the kids play in the sandbox while you eat great food and experience the great vibe padaro beach grill offers. Recommend this place to everyone!  Oh and their sweet potato fries....yummy!!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I ate here on Saturday. You stand in line to order, they give you a buzzer when your food is ready. 
We ordered shrimp tacos- amazing! They only use one tortilla so you'll need a fork! They were so delicious! A week later and we are still talking about them!
Fresh yellowtail fish sandwich, nice thick piece of fish and very good.
Chips and guac, very good but it's a small amount of guacamole
808 and a frozé
You pick a spot to sit, there is an adults only area. The only downside is the adults only area has very little shade, would be nice if they put some umbrellas in that area. Other areas had tables with shade and they have a big sandy area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Not a fun relaxed family restaurant like it used to be. New owners and ruined the genuine feel. Kids get scolded for running around, no dogs, no good food. Used to be the best food! Really really disappointed."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Such a fun and cute place to stop with the kids when you've been driving for a while! Perfect place for the kids to run around and let the wiggles out while you sit and have a burger right next to the ocean! We really enjoyed it!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The food was lousey.  I tried theee dishes, Shrimp tacos, tri tip sandwich, and quesadilla and they were all unenjoyable.  The salsa was flavorless.  Meat was tough and fatty.  No hard liquor.  This place has a fun ambiance but don't come for the food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is the cutest place EVER! I felt like I was in a different country on vacation... the cutest outdoor area with lots of trees and a beautiful view of the ocean. 5 stars for the view alone, but the food was JUST as amazing!! The fish tacos were so delicious. Lot's of fresh fish with a side of crispy tortilla chips. MMMM.

They also have a huge sand area for the kids to play. A very family-friendly environment. I can see this place getting packed so I recommend coming before sunset to secure a spot.

LOVE LOVE LOVE. Wish they had something like this in the Bay Area :("
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The perfect place for lunch with a friend! Right off the freeway and yet very secluded and private. The food was amazing and service was fast and friendly. The outside seating is perfect with great views. Highly recommend!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Perfect spot to relax with some food and a beer in the sunshine and let the kids play in the sandbox.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,What an awesome place to stop and chillax with your friends and pups! Totally dog friendly. Great food and reasonable prices. Beautiful property and hip restaurant vibes. I would love to visit again on my next beach trip.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"With very little options to choose from for dinner in Carpinteria, this place is definitely a great spot. Located right next to the beach, Padaro is the perfect place to enjoy the sunset. The outdoor seating has a beautiful ambiance from both the light fixtures over top of the umbrellas and the various fires that provide a welcoming warmth. Padaro is a great place for families with kids to go to as well because there is plenty of space for children to play on the grass or even he sand spot. As for the food, I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich and it was very fresh and enjoyable. The food was not spectacular by any means but with fairly decent pricing and an enjoyable environment overall, I would definitely return to Padaro in the near future."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The shrimp tacos and calamari were delish! And the beach views were amazing. There was an private event so an area was closed off. But still very pretty and good
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I have driven past this place many times on trips along the coast and finally decided to give it a try. The reviews are what convinced us to have lunch here during my birthday weekend. I'm so happy we did. You really can't go wrong having a cold beer and delicious fish tacos. The outdoor patio area is reason enough to stop by, my kids loved it. Thank you Padaro Beach Grill for making my weekend even better! We will definitely be back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I wish I lived closer because this place is the bomb! Such a great decor and beachy cool ambiance. Great outdoor seating by the beach with sand play area for kids and also a few indoor seating for hotter days. Delicious burgers and fries! So many options I definitely recommend this to anyone whether it be date night or a family gathering. (Sunsets here are gorgeous!)
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great location. Kids love this place. The food is always delicious. When you come here it feels like you're on a picnic but you don't have to do the cooking. Or the dishes :)
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great tasting food and beer! The location is right next to the ocean and they have a huge grassy area for seating and a center treed area for 21+.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place! It's beautiful, great ambiance, great service, great views, great food. My favorite place to stop by when coming back from Summerland."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Such a great place for families to meet up... decent food, drinks & awesome play zone for kids... all within steps to an incredibly beautiful beach! Absolutely love it!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,One of my favorite places to come grab lunch whenever I'm around the area. I love the friendly service and the view outside is to die for!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Went there not knowing they had a vegan menu. Much to my surprise not only did they but it was amazing. Great food. Good prices loved the outdoor seating . See the Ocean watch train go by as you eat. Children can play in the sand box. Might Even see a bunny hoping around.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This special place is a Santa Claus Lane institution. We make it here every month or so to sit outside on the picnic tables and eat excellent fish tacos and burgers, chicken sandwiches and fantastic onion rings. But now we can safely also say that they host great parties. We had 140 people to Padaro Beach Grill last weekend for our son's bar mitzvah and Will and his team couldn't have been better. They set up everything, from tables with guac & chips on them for the guests, to the sound system, to the buffet afterwards. It was a memorable day and we're grateful for Will's professionalism and his team's willingness to help make it a special day."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The owner's response pretty much validates all of my initial complaints. The fact that he would rather turn the conversation to him owning a small business and employing others is a desperate attempt to make me a  bad guy for leaving a review on a review site. He can't see why I would leave a review now, well I was talking to a future bride and after I told her about my headache with Padaro she said I should have left a review, so I did. It's to help others avoid that situation. Honestly a response as simple as explaining that policies with booking wedding parties had been changed since that time was all I really wanted.

The emails the owner provided only back up the points I was making. The other party didn't want another wedding there either and would have appreciated better communication. And reiterating that all these other people left positive reviews doesn't refute anything. I'm baffled that a business would share emails showing that both parties were upset less than a week prior to the event.

But the attitude of the owner was perfectly demonstrated with him calling me entitled for wanting better communication. And him claiming that no restaurants can tell you what tables you'll get is a lie. Padaro was actually the only restaurant out of ten that never provided me a clear answer on that. 

As to the owner's invitation to resolve things privately. I doubt the sincerity of that considering how much text he dedicated to disagreeing with me. Besides, I didn't leave a response to find a resolution, I left one so others planning parties were more informed than I was. Thankfully due to the owner's response they can see for themselves what working with this restaurant is like."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I was introduced to Padero Beach Grill today by a colleague. Prices are a bit steep, but the food was delish. I had the ahi burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was great -- I asked for the fish to be rare and they delivered! The fries were divine. Hope to stop by again soon. Great place for a relaxed lunch with friends from out of town...."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"This is a really nice spot to eat right next to the beach. There's a large green area with picnic tables outside and a little sandbox area for kiddos. I had a club sandwich, which was pretty good, and we shared a trio platter, which was alright. The trio included French fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. The fries were all pretty limp. I would definitely just go for straight up onion rings next time, because they were good. The whole lunch seemed better than it probably was because they also have Blue Moon on tap, which lightened the mood! Yum! We might go back when we're on vacation next year, or we may look for other good places to eat. Overall it was pretty good. Not great. But good."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Had my moms 80th birthday party last night. We reserved tables and they had it all set up and ready to. Great location and food.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fish tacos, fish and chips, turkey burger, and fries are all excellent. The patio is huge and looks out over Santa Claus Lane beach. They serve quote a few different beers. It's on my way home from work and I stop here a lot. Great place."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants!

I wouldn't go there because of their food... but because the atmosphere.

My kids got to play in the sand, so I actually got to enjoy my meal.

There was a live band.

And the best part is the pricing was so reasonable.

I can't wait to go back!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Fish used for fish & chips was sold as fresh but was clearly frozen/defrosted and quite fishy with a very sweet tartar sauce for dipping. Perhaps unrelated, this place is literally on the beach. Didn't expect fine fare, but freshness and simplicity at a beach-side cafe is often nice, and it does tend to happen in some places (for example, Malibu, CA, and Wellfleet, MA)."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Came here for a birthday dinner a couple weeks ago. This place had the best environment and location!! The food was pretty good, but the location and people made this an amazing experience! Would definitely be back when in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My favorite place to stop between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara! Great food and nice outdoor area with grass, tables, beach and jungle! It feels like your in a backyard having lunch. It is dog friendly and everyone is very nice. It is usually very busy and that is always nice to see."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I stop here every time when I come to Carpenteria. The food and drinks are good. It has art all over the place. Everything is clean. I had an issue with the pizza once, but everything else is good."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Padaro Beach Grill is a very special place to me. Every summer, I stay with family at one of the houses along Padaro Lane, and I look forward to the day we all walk along the beach down to PBG for lunch. 

I always get a beer and the fish and chips substitute sweet potato fries. This year I also had some the deep fried green beans. They were delicious and had a little spicy kick. Their burgers and sandwiches are also very good. They follow along with the California beach theme, so lots of island flavors and fish options. A favorite by my sister is the the salmon sandwich that was a special this summer. 

The overall environment is also fun. You order then later pick up your food, which means that it has a free for all type of seating. There are 4 different places to sit: Inside (which is small and crowded), outside on the lawn (Dogs are allowed here), Sandbox (very kid friendly, because it has a sandy play area), and Adult only (no children allowed)."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Had an excellent lunch from here (Takeaway) I ordered the grilled fish tacos and think I received the Baja (?) tacos instead (fish was breaded) but the tacos were still excellent, fish was very fresh and cooked perfectly. My husband had the Padaro burger and it was also excellent, juicy and just the right amount of sauce and toppings. Highly recommend lunch from here if in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We have eaten at this restaurant many times and never had a bad meal.  It is not full service so expect to get a pager and go and retrieve your meal.  This is located by the water and is family friendly.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Really relaxing atmosphere, fresh food and great view, enjoy your meal right next to the beach. I have had a few items on the menu and so far no complaints. They have no problem substituting items which is great!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place was a great find. Glad we stopped. I had the grilled chicken sandwich. It was great!  Our friends had the BBQ chicken salad which looked amazing!  The burgers and onion rings looked great!  That's what we will try next time. The prices were very good and the seating area is outside in their garden across from the ocean.  Just beautiful!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Lots of kid friendly aspects, lots of potential, but still needs some ironing out the kinks. Not the most efficient right now when they get a rush. Fries were cold, burger not cooked to order. Still wasn't bad, but seems like this place will get better."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great restaurant.    My family went last night and we were very impressed.   Service was great, food was great, especially the Hickory Burger and Onion Rights.     If you want a totally chill place to hang out and eat a good burger this is your place.     

Nice that you can bring kids and let them play, but even better that you can sit away from playing kids and relax.    

You can tell the new owners have really reinvented the restaurant."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place to eat, beautiful scenery. Everybody happy. Right off the freeway too. I must stop for a beer a fish taco"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We've been coming here forever to grab a bite after a beach day.  Food is consistently good, nothing amazing.  Local beer and wine choices excellent.   Such an easy stop off the 101 to give your kids a break from the drive."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is our go to place! Has something for everyone and awesome burgers. Great atmosphere, plenty of room, delicious food and drinks. Just be prepared to wait in a long line for the bathroom if it's busy."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place was to cool the outdoor sitting was really nice. The steak sandwich was delicious.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is lovely! The food is great, and the view is awesome. The staff was very friendly and our food came out fairly quickly."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Michelada's were great. Food was good but nothing spectacular. This place is good because it's a spot to stop if you have kids in the car wanting to run around. We did it heading up from LA to Cambria. It was perfect for that. The view and location is great.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The location was great! The food I ordered was a California burger with fries and it wasn't anything special. The burger was thick and the bun became soggy toward the end, so it fell apart. I liked the ambience and the fries the most."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,What a great place!  On our way up from San Diego found this little gem-thanks YELP.  Worth the stop for tasty bites with a lovely casual and inviting outside environment.  The fish tacos...grilled and battered were fresh and filling.  Would definitely stop in here again when hungry and on the road!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome place to bring kids! Just make sure to beat the lunch time rush.

I had the grilled chicken sandwich on a brioche bun with BBQ sauce. On it's own it was decent, but dipped in a side of ranch it was amazing! 

The sweet potato fries were also delicious."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Love this place! First timer here and had heard about this place for years so glad we finally went. After a long day at the beach this was a great stop before heading home. Line was long when we arrived on a Sunday about 5:30 pm but it moved quickly. Food came quick and we were all happy with our meals. Husband ordered a Burger that was so tasty and I ordered the Cobb Salad which was great too. Fresh ingredients and our friends enjoyed their meals just as much. Can't beat the sandbox entertainment for the kids either!! Will be back for sure!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Every time out family eats at the Padaro Beach Grill, it's an experience that goes way beyond the food.  Imagine capping a perfect beach day (nearby Padaro Beach promises that) with a libation and tasty meal you carry out to picnic tables on a large lawn overlooking the ocean and setting sun, where kids can move around and get the sand off, and adults can just relax and enjoy!  If you are between Carpinteria and Santa Barbara, treat yourself to a local treasure."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,What a beautiful and huge place. They have many benches to sit in a very cozy Hawaiian style area. You can sit on the high chairs and eat while looking at the ocean or near the fire and enjoy your food. The food was super fresh and delicious and the prices are decent. The staff were very friendly. I loved it honestly. They also have a sand play ground for kids. I would recommend it.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is great! The food is delicious,and for being on the beach they don't price gouge you. Exelent generous portions.Good draft beer selection at good prices. .Nice tropical looking patio. A gem in Carpinteria."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We had a great time and the food was good. They have veggie burgers and vegan ice cream for me and my family enjoyed the pescatarian burgers and fries. It's rather noisy but sometimes that's just what you want and it has views of the ocean and a play area for the children a nice typical beach burger joint for the whole family even the gluten vegan!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A great outdoor place to let your kids roam around, if you have them. It's right next to the ocean so it's also a great place to watch the sunset. Lines are usually not too long; the kitchen works hard and the employees are friendly. The food is great for the price, although I wish they had more vegetarian/vegan options! 
(Edit: on my last re-visit I didn't order a California burger as usual, but a double vegan burger. Although ""make it a double"" is advertised on the menu as ""+$1.50"", the cashier charged us $2.50. We asked her why and she said the bean patties were more expensive than the hamburgers. This doesn't make any sense - how can meat, that needs a lot of crop for feed, and water to grow that crop, be cheaper than a single bean patty, that uses about a tenth of needed resources?!)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place! Food is probably realistically  a 4-star but for the ""Central Coast"" I give it a five for its setting, taste, and generous portions for the price. Always packed and we always bring our out if town/state visitors here! Afterwards the Beach is a great option to get a little R&R! Love the location. Onion rings, chicken club and the steak sandwich are all excellent. Had the chopped salad this last time, it was excellent too!!! My friends had the sweet potato fries and they said their recipe is excellent!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Good spot for a meeting.  Lots of tables out on the grass and no hurry.  Food is good - try the superb fresh rockfish tacos.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Awesome place! Such a rad atmosphere...and the burgers are totally great! Been here many times and their chili is so good-
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Amazing food! Excellent service. The best part of the place is the park for children to play so families can eat and just enjoy. Definitely coming back here!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Best ever lunch stop for a family road trip. Order at the counter and pick up when it's ready. Good fish tacos, healthy options for kids' meals, outdoor picnic tables with umbrellas in fenced back yard, and a sand pit with toys for younger kids to decompress outside the car. Easy parking right off the freeway, steps from the beach. Would gladly come back and hang out longer."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The employees are kind. The food is amazing. Great beer selection. Beautiful view on beach. Freeway access southbound. Plenty of parking. Tons of seating and majority outside.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Best part about this place is the exceptional location and the view. You can go at sunset and see the dolphins gliding by mere feet from your table. What's not to like about that? 

The food is kind of hit and miss. Some things are really good (they do a pretty decent burger and fries and a couple of the salads are very tasty, for example) and others are mediocre (the fish and chips aren't really satisfying and some dishes are bland.) 

The service is also hit and miss. We've been here when the service is fast, accurate and friendly and other times when they were too busy talking to each other about someone's recent date to even take our order correctly or tell us they were out of our second choice orders. Weird. 

Bottom line: Reasonable place, if you go on a good day, you can get a great meal and sometimes it can be just mediocre. But you will always have an exceptional view!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place for the kids to run around and play while the adults enjoy some food and drinks. Food is good, burgers are great, salads are yummy and milk shakes are my kids favorite. We eat here all the time and Santa Claus Beach is our favorite beach!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Made a stop here on our way to Santa Barbara and I must say I'm so glad we did! We ordered the prime burger with cheese and pretzel burger with lettuce + tomato. For sides, we had the fried calamari and regular fries. Grabbed a table out in the back and enjoyed the beautiful view. The back area also had a fire pit and sand pit for the kiddos. There were a couple of celebrations happening during our visit but still plenty of tables left for grabs. Our food was good but just wished it came out hotter. Other than that we enjoyed our meal here with a great ambiance!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good sized portions, tasty food, beer on tap, and an awesome view. Especially cool when the train goes by. I've eaten here a handful of times and always liked their fries and some burgers are better than others."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The food here is just ok, compared to anywhere else. The place is a pretty cool to eat outside. They just have to do something about the food. Parking is the worst. Sorry not impressed."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Decided to try this out for the first official day of summer and I can't say enough great things about this place! I am so happy that we found this gem. 
Came here on Saturday and ordered the Baja fish tacos, the Beach club sandwich, fries and drinks. 

The drinks we ordered were a mango margarita and a michelada with Modelo beer. We got the drinks right away and they were perfect for the warm summer day. Both drinks were chilled and tasted so great! 

Food was super yummy! Fries were cooked super crispy just the way I like them. The chicken for the beach club sandwich was really tender and grilled excellently. Loved the fish tacos especially with the fresh pico de Gallo! 

Besides the food being amazing, the whole setting and location of the restaurant is beautiful. Couple feet away from the beach. There's lots of outdoor seating with picnic tables which are great for big groups or just a nice date for two. They're dog friendly which is a big plus for me. Overall I loved this place. Really makes you appreciate Santa Barbara county even more!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The busy street parking made me a little nervous when we rolled up to Padaro's. I thought for sure there would be a long line and no where to sit. While the line to order did take a little long (I think one customer was just being difficult, so hopefully the long wait to order was out of the norm), there were plenty of tables inside and outside. I LOVE this place and I'm so glad a friend recommended it to me. We were on our way to the Santa Barbara Zoo, and this was the perfect place to stop, eat and let our 2-year old run on the grass and play in the sand. Everyone was very friendly, and the staff were very helpful. One staff member saw a bird munch on our nacho chip, so they brought us out a fresh plate of nachos! We didn't even see the bird snag a bite.

The food was pretty good, the restaurant seemed new and/or well maintained and the bathrooms (yes, two of them) were very clean. We even saw an Amtrak train go by---what kid doesn't love to see a choo choo. I love that you can sit at a table right by the sandbox so that you can enjoy your food and still keep a close eye on your kid. Overall our experience there was excellent and we shall return. I wish there were a place like this closer to home."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Food was amazing! The only reason I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is because the bathroom line was super long the whole time we were there. You would think with how busy they are they would add more. But I would def. be back if I'm ever in the area. I had the fish and chips and it's everything you would want your fish and chips to be. The onion rings are also very tasty. Not oily at all. Great selection of drinks also and really friendly staff. The place is really clean and well kept.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great place to grab a burger or sandwich on an outdoorsy beach day.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Every thing about this place is great! The grounds are inviting with all the palm trees and picnic tables.  Its family friendly with the sand play area for kids.  The food not only looks appetizing but taste as good as it looks.  My husband and I stop here when traveling to and from No Cali, it never disappoints.  On this last visit we ordered the green chili burger with the chili cheese fries.  The burger was perfectly cooked and the green chilies with all the other toppings were on point, the chili cheese fries were crispy even with the chili on top, the chili was full of flavor and just the right amount of cheese.  It's always a treat to stop here, they're food is consistently top notch!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good food good service and great prices! Nice beach  front atmosphere almost felt like Hawaii I recommend the salon burger, beach club sandwich,   pretzel burger and onions rings crispy!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Best and tastiest grilled fish tacos! Came with chips n salsa. Decent choice of local micro brews. Very busy with long lines on weekends. Often birthday parties, and special events, but it is a very large  area with umbrellas at tables for shade, Along with covered patio area. You may need to send someone to save an outdoor table while standing in line to order.  Great family atmosphere. Outdoor seating only. No table service, counter orders only and service is friendly and quick. I will be back. Dog friendly."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The place is overall a beautiful location! They have 1 or 2 vegan options and were accommodating in making my burger vegan. However, their vegan burger was underwhelming. It needed a lot more seasoning. We went during a busy time, so our food came cold, but they gave us fresh fries."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Start review five this place is amazing they have a really nice outside area the food is good the view of the water is perfect! I definitely recommend this place for the price and the atmosphere..
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A fantastic place near the beach, a great restaurant to share a meal with family and friends. The location is superb!! ; it has a wide open outdoor dining overlooking our beautiful Pacific Ocean.  Everyone  there seemed enjoying food, conversation and the outdoor sitting area , just enjoying life itself!!

It's all open picnic table kind of seating. Ot has a little play area for the kids. Burgers were amazing and the weather was just right and all was well in my practically perfect amazing world."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Last night we had our daughter's wedding reception dinner @ PBG for about 65 people. We had probably the best party experience we've ever had. Their staff arranged tables for us with reserved signs, and were able to manage producing 65 meals promptly and perfectly! As I walked around talking to guests, almost every guest (many from out of town) raved about the quality of the food. Obviously, the venue couldn't be better... as there is plenty of room for a big party. It felt private without being too secluded. I would definitely recommend PBG for hosting a large party. The staff is amazing... helpful and happy. 
Thanks Will and the PBG team for making our party a great one!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We came to check out this place and I have to say it was pretty awesome! The line was short when we came and order came out quick. Was clean, masks worn, great outdoor seating with space for the family and right on the beach. Oh and the food was great!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Every Sunday, my family drives to Santa Barbara for the beach, the sun, and the surf. But one of the best parts about our beach day is ordering food from Padaro Beach Grill. I can't say enough how this restaurant brings me and my family pure joy. The food is fantastic, of the best quality, yet not overpriced. My kids love the burgers, my wife is a huge fan of the veggie burger, and the fried Baja fish tacos topped with the smoked tarter sauce are MY favorite. We always order online and the order is ready when they say it will be. They always offer condiments at pick-up, which is a nice touch, and there's always a smile to go along with the food. 

Some people say it's the little things in life that make life worthwhile- when it comes to this phenomenal little restaurant tucked next to the ocean, I'd say that's an observation proven true."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,I have gone several times yet today the fish and shrimp tacos was less than impressive. Tasteless and cold.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Fish and chips were cooked to perfection! My husband ordered the shrimp tacos which where also so so good!!! The view along with the amazing food was so peaceful. This place is a must try!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I order the prime burger + cheese + avo + bacon, onion rings and milkshake.
The burgers was exquisite.  Soft bread....  meat taste....  so rich in flavor.
The portion of the onion rings was pretty small.
Milkshake was fine, not too sweet.
And the best of all is the location, right in front of the ocean.  You have the waves a few feet away from your plate.
Good food, great location."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is a wonderful restaurant with a fabulous, fun and casual beach vibe. The food is excellent and I found many options that were vegetarian and vegan too! Healthy, creative and delicious menu! Super nice staff too! We came for a group party and went back again the next day for lunch. We will be back again for sure!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"So first off, the pretzel burger is hands-down the best burger there. It sounds a little weird but it's AMAZING. Their onion rings are so good, too, so I'd recommend you at least try those. The food comes out in a decent amount of time, the staff and service are great, and you really can't go wrong here menu-wise. The seating and views are amazing. The train can be a little loud but it's so infrequent that you don't really need to worry about it. 
Just a really good place."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Probably one of the best vegan cheese burgers I've ever had. The fries were pretty standard and ice tea was delicious. Beautiful beach scenery. I'll definitely be back.

UPDATE: I've been back a number of times and even brought the family here. I want to update my review of the Vegan Cheeseburger. I'm not vegan, but the Mrs. is. I've had it enough times now, I'm quite certain this is one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had; vegan or not!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great place! Too bad the beautiful outside area was closed due to COVID. It's outside in the open next to the beach and I thought you could order food to go and eat at their tables but it wasn't allowed. We ate in the car and the food was delicious! However it would be a good idea to double up on the tortillas for the fish tacos. Can't wait to come back when it's open!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"All of this is a big yes. The wait was only about 4 minutes in line to get our food. Once we got a beeper they called us to get our food within ten minutes. The ranch is homemade and was magin sauce to everything it touched. The french fries were shoe string, but not hard shoe string, the perfect combo of soft and crispy. The burger was stacked high with quality ingredients. The bun was obviously freshly made and toasted. There are so many menu options this is a great place to appease a group. This could also be a great date place or place to grab a day drink. They have a huge sand castle/kids area. This is a must go in my book."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Lived in SB for years and have forgotten how great this place is! Great burgers and beer with good prices right next to Santa Claus beach is hard to beat. Also a great place for large groups and kids.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We met our friends here for a casual lunch.  You stand in line and order at the counter, get a buzzer & seat yourself.  When the buzzer goes off, you go back to get our food.

The Trio, which comes with French fries/onion rings/sweet potato fries, was pretty good.  Between the four of us, we devoured the whole plate.

My wife liked her salmon sandwich, and my club sandwich hit the spot as well.

There is plentiful outdoor seating but only a few indoor tables.  There is a small covered patio outside as well, in case of rainy weather -- however, it is very small with only a couple of small tables.

There is a sandy area where kids can play and get nice and dirty.  Wooden picnic tables are scattered throughout the spacious outdoor seating area.  Unfortunately, the ocean is RIGHT THERE, but you can't really see it because of the tall fence that separates the restaurant grounds from the railroad track that is immediately outside."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"PadaroBeach Grill is nestled along the beach in Carpinteria and makes for the perfect dining spot and stop if you're driving along the 101

The menu is diverse with plenty of options for salads and sandwiches in addition to a vegan menu 

Their drink menu offers a little something for everyone's taste. 

We had the arugula salad with grilled albacore and avocado and the albacore tuna melt with french fries. 

I had an incredibly delicious margarita. The jalapeño strawberry margarita with chili salt on the rim is the perfect mix of spicy and sweet. 

The dining area is massive and offers a section for diners with dogs as well as an adult on,y section. There are plenty of tables to choose from depending on if you want to be in the sun or the shade. 

 Make this a dining destination!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Super cool spot! We were so happy we stopped here for a bite and drink. Food was good and the outdoor seating had a beautiful view of the beach.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I can't think of a better place to have a burger and a beer with friends and family. Great space for the kids to play and stunning views of the Pacific (You can throw a rock in the water) and a damn good burger. 

This place is really like spending an afternoon in your own backyard. If you live in the area or are cruising down the 101, you should definitely stop in for a bite!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food.  Driving home from solvang and we got hungry so I found this place on yelp.  We shared a California burger with fries,  an order of fish tacos (grilled) & a lemonade.  The girls at the counter were super friendly, the bathroom was spotless and the food was Excellent! The atmosphere was an added plus as well with a huge picnic area and about 10ft to the ocean (but you can't get there from here due to the railroad tracks) and the sound of the ocean.  There is also a big huge sandpit filled with toys if you have kids. Plenty of free parking in front as well."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"i haven't received my food,i recieved a notification saying that my food arrived no knock which i specifically said to knock on my door there was no knock and i didnt recieve my food what the hell is going on here i am starving and i rely on grubhub this is a damn joke...i think i need a refund!!!!!...i guess we get what we deserve especially being a driver and cant go nowhere being stuck in a motel...this is a damn joke!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Always come here when i am with my kids. They always love comming here especially on a nice hot summer day. 
Atmosphere is a 10! I couldnt ask for a better scenery. Food is a 10+ maui burgers are TDF! As well as the bbq chicken salad and chicken nachos! Kids get burgers and grilled cheese sammies are massive also. This has something for everyone. Dont eat meat? Theres fish, shrimp, turkey and i believe garden burgers also. Theres also a nice sand area complete with sun chairs and pails and shovels for the kids. Alcholoic beverages available and fresh lemonaide! Between this place and our usual SB taco place its worth a visit for food and sceneray."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wanted a quick lunch on the road just before getting to Santa Barbara. Such a fun spot. Food was all very tasty with generous portions. Service staff very friendly. Was very busy, but lines moved at a good pace.  Lots of fun seating options - indoor, outdoor, kid sandbox, adults only, etc.  Highly recommended!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I really wanted to like this place. I didn't like the 2 items that we had ordered. Let's start with the greasy fish and chips. Please people change your oil and give us a crispy batter not soft and oily. The next item was Calamari. I really do not like pre battered frozen Calamari rings. If you're going to have an eatery on the beach please be a little more authentic. It was clean and nice but I wish we had a view of the sea. They have a hedge around it ""No View"""
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Tasty Ahi sandwhich. Great view. Very good service.  Took a while to find and try this place but now we know why it's a local casual hot spot. Didn't get dessert but it and the shakes looked great.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Quick-service type of place with picnic tables outside.  Don't forget your sunscreen because there is not a lot of shade!  Otherwise, we enjoyed the food here - the shrimp tacos were yummy : )!  The only thing that would have made them better is if the tortillas were grilled!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Little kids will love the sand play area, your taste buds will love the yummy burgers and onion rings. This is a tourist destination so it is busy, but not overpriced. I had the hickory burger with thick, crispy bacon. My wife had the shrimp tacos and probably wouldn't get them again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is the places for some fast seafood in the area. They use red snapper for their tacos and fish and chips which makes sense since it's the local white fish. 

Here's is a hint: if you're menu says cod or halibut and your in Socal, you're at the wrong place!

The grilled fish tacos were good but the fish and chips stole the show! Great tartar sauce and the salsa for the chips was yummy. We will be coming back to here our next visit!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Completely got my order wrong. I am gluten free and ordered a Hickory burger lettuce wrap with an extra patty. Not only did they not lettuce wrap it but it was the completely wrong burger and didn't even have the second party. When I called to let them know they didn't pick up the phone and when I tried to go back to let them know the restaurant was closed. Very disappointed!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome, right on the beach, dolphins in the water and great Salmon sando, pitchers of beer and friendly staff."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is our favorite spot to enjoy lunch or dinner on our way back to LA from Santa Barbara! 

The food is delicious and the ambiance is lovely.  But the #1 biggest selling point?  There's a giant sand box for kids to play in.  Once you get them fed, you can enjoy a glass of wine and your meal in peace, while your children play happily in the sand.  And the periodic trains that pass by are an added bonus for my train-obsessed son.

Every family I know who has been here, goes back again and again.  There's even a separate area to get away from the kids, if you just want to enjoy your food with adults only."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Thoroughly impressed when some friends and I stopped here on our way south. Amazing views, great atmosphere, and good food. Quick, fresh eats."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Driving up the coast to our Wine Tasting location, I found Padaro's on the Yelp! map.  Wanted to be on or close to the coast for lunch.  So, this place had great reviews and was close to the coast.

The staff was very nice and welcoming.  The menu was eclectic and should provide options for any type of taste in your party.  You can sit under a roof, or head outside and view the beach.  Can't actually get to the beach from this location, but close enough.  Plus it was so windy that day.  I mean, really windy, my friend was surprised.

The shrimp taco and turkey burger was awesome.  The fries, with the burger, were awesome.  I had to try them.  Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I can be picky with fries and loved these.

Lunch was awesome and there is a pet friendly zone and then a larger play area for kids and for groups to sit and possibly have a party if you desire.

Worth the stop off Exit 88 and a great view of the beach.  Thanks Padaro!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We hadn't been to the Grill for a while, but stopped the other day on the way home from Carpinteria.  My fish tacos, Baja style, we're exceptional. My friends shrimp were likewise.  The portions were on the light side, but while that worked for me, my friend remained hungry. We also ordered a basket of sweet potato French fries which were exceptional and helped fill him up. All in all a good place to stop. Looks like maybe under new management, with much remodeled. You can eat in the cafe or outside at one of the multiple picnic tables spread across the well-planted yard."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"On a summer day traveling down Santa Barbara, I recommend making a pit stop at Padaro Beach and Grill for some fresh lemonade and french fries! The service was friendly and fast and the food was decently price. Once I got my order, sitting outside was THEE option to enjoy the beautiful blue skies and cool breeze. I'll be going back if I'm ever in Santa Barbara again!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My wife and I recently had the opportunity to lunch at Padaro's.
This isn't the place for you if you like to park close but, if you don't mind walking a bit along a beautiful shore in what is often perfect weather, you will find a lovely spot in Padaro's.
My favorite thing about it is the view and, as the day was a bit warm, the breeze. The food is very nice, too, and it was just the perfect stop along a long drive for a little lunch overlooking the ocean."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Reasonably priced, fast service, yummy food. Very family friendly. Extremely spacious and comfortable."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Who wouldn't love it here? The menu is awesome, and they even have gluten-free options! You can't beat sitting so close to the ocean. The vibe is killer. A definite MUST when you're in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Subpar and tasteless seafood served at a beautiful location. I would not recommend this place for the food. It was not well seasoned and I could have made a better dish at home. Really questionable that this place is so highly rated on Yelp but that must be because of the location.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Very good burgers and sandwiches. Great for the family and kids. Parking is on the street. Only two special needs parking spots. Lots of outside seating on the lawn. Nicer than sitting in the car. Front side you can keep an eye on your vehicles, but there is freeway noise. Backyard is nice and view of the beach. Don't know how it is when the Amtrak passes by."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Two people can eat for $20, if they don't order drinks. I love the veggie burger. The fries and onion rings are great, too. It's a nice outdoor setting, if the weather is fine. 101 Freeway is right there, so that can be a bit noisy.

The kids behind the counter are fast, efficient and helpful. Lots of smiles.

My only gripe is that some people allow their kids to run around, with noticeably little to no supervision. We were having a really nice lunch, until a little girl (definitely old enough to know better) wouldn't let up on chasing birds. Around and around she went, terrorizing the birds.  Mommy didn't even look up. 

The sandbox is a nice feature, and I noticed kids making new friends, which was sweet."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Every time we are driving to or from wine country, this is our go-to for lunch or dinner along the way! Love the burgers and we love that it's dog friendly!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I would like to celebrate every single event left in my life here at Padaro. Birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, reunions. But unfortunately, I live in Seattle :( 

What a gem this place is. Great food, and an even better location away from busy downtown Santa Barbara. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who's visiting the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This is a fantastic family place. Perfect for enjoying a beer and watching the sunset while kids play. The food is good. The setting -- right at the beac -- is wonderful. What's not to like!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great burgers, tri tip fries, local beers on tap, outdoor beach front seating, fun for the whole family. Staff is always great! If you want somewhere to eat outside durning the pandemic, this is it"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Very casual reminds me of a place I used to go to and diamond Head on Oahu the staff is awesome but you're nice kids working here nice music they have an adult area beautiful view of the beach I highly recommend this place as I said great ambiance
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped here on my way to SLO. Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I tried the grilled chicken on sourdough with bbq sauce and it was really good. The chicken was cooked perfect! I also ordered the sweet potato fries and I really enjoyed them. I am really picky when it comes to sweet potato fries and they were really good! My husband ordered the burger and he enjoyed his as well. The prices were reasonable and there was plenty of outdoor seating. Also, the restroom was really cleaned and smelled really nice. I was so impressed with how clean the restroom was. I am traveling with a newborn and it is really important to me to have a nice clean bathroom where I can change him. It was a really nice place and I will definitely stop here again in the future!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What I don't like about this place is---- nothing!!
The Padaro burger is the best, the fish taco is great, fish and chips are fantastic.
This is a great family place, kid and pet friendly. My grandkids love it because they can play while waiting for the food. It's a busy place, but well worth the wait."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food is so delicious (: they had a wide variety on the menu. I had shrimp tacos and fish tacos. Each order came with two tacos and chips with salsa. The salsa was quite spicy.

Parking:
Very limited in front of the restaurant. There is also parking on the sides of the street across the restaurant.

Placing order:
Call 805.566.9800 to place takeout order. You can also place an order on yelp via grub hub. 

Picking up Order:
The staff will call out the order numbers and bring them out to you!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We visited here last month and were so glad we did. We had burgers, sweet potato fries and an incredible view! Great service, prices and atmosphere. We didn't have our kids with us but such a great spot if you are with family too."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I used to come here regularly starting in the mid 90's until about 6 years ago... COULD NOT WAIT to get back to that awesome family friendly, dog friendly and FUN place on Santa Clause Ln. Boy how times change! It's ALL picnic tables, which are ""fun""... for an hour. The way it used to be, you could eat, drink and chill for hours! Now it's all just a bunch of rules (see pics). All I wanted was to sit in a beach chair (not allowed), eat their food and pair it with a nice bottle of wine (no outside food). I asked about corkage, "" we don't allow outside food or drink"". Ok, I'll just pour it in my Yeti wine cup and not tell you. Your money! So may I have a menu to take to my wife whom is holding our table? ""We don't have menus, order off the board"", said the snotty punk. I was on the fence about leaving because the weather is so nice! But all I saw were signs that said ""no this, no that"" family friendly and kids can't run, jump or play ball WTF? Sorry, but what a huge disappointment."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food, generous servings,  great service. Parking is always a challenge, but it is worth it! Nice outdoor seating, play area is fun for the kids. A great family setting. I highly recommend this restaurant."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopping at Padaro Beach Grill is so worth the visit just for the adventure of such a unique location.  We always enjoy the food, almost too many great choices.  You can't go wrong with a place that has such a pleasant beach side yard and patio especially comfortable for families with small kids."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is a fantastic stopover for parents with children.  The setting is lovely and kids have a blast. The burger is decent and the prices are just right for what you receive. 

The shakes were good too. 

My only complaint is the food could use a little tweaking to make the overall experience better (and attract local repeat visitors). The fish tacos are way underseasoned.   The fish should be salted, the batter should be seasoned, and the slaw should have some flavor. It took some work to salt and season it all up myself an the effect was not the same.  \

The burgers are quite tasty, but while tending to the kids I let it sit and it sogged up the bun really fast.  A toasted bun would add many points to the burger score. 

Can't beat the location though and if you keep the order simple its perfect."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Their fish and chips is THE best fish I've ever eaten! The fish is so fresh and flaky and cooked to perfection. The atmosphere in the outdoor eating areas is so nice, particularly after dark with the lights, tiki torches and Bonfire."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great spot for an easy dinner with a nice area for kids to play and run around with picnic tables and near the beach. The food was good enough, but not memorable. We waited in a line to order - popular place."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Passing through, excited to have a burger, have a service animal and they have a large yard with picnic tables but do not allow dogs on property At All. No signs. Waited in line. Lame..."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great outdoor seating (although the name is a bit misleading, there is no beach view of beach access). Large grassy outdoor space with lots of picnic tables. Food is casual (burgers, salads, etc). The beach club sandwich was delicious and the piña colada smoothie was great too. A great spot to take the family!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great beachside food: wIll definitely go back to Padaro Beach Grill. We had fish tacos and chili fries - food tasted great! Menu has something for a variety of preferences (tacos, sandwiches, burgers) and everything was prepared fresh. And ice cream sandwiches or milkshakes to top it all off. 

All outdoor seating which is perfect for social distancing! Great place to stop for a quick bite during a road trip or after spending the afternoon at the beach. For casual dining, this place is great."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Great location.  OK food.  We came for a late lunch but it's pretty obvious that this place can get wild - it felt distinctly as if I had walked into a Parrothead convention.   This feeling was reinforced when a couple of Jimmy Buffet tunes came over the sound system.  

You order at a counter.  My friend got the veggie burger (they have a couple of different burger options for vegetarians).  I admittedly ordered wrong.  Of COURSE you get the burger here.  But I just wasn't in a burger mood...  so I got the tuna melt.  And we ordered ""The Trio"" of sides - french fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings - to share.  

It's like a backyard picnic - with picnic style seating.  There are a couple of tables inside and on the patio, but the real action is around back by the ocean.  The view isn't fantastic...  there is a tall wall separating the ""dining"" area from the beach, but you can still catch a glimpse of sand if you sit on one of the bar stools and stretch.  

Being the grumpy *itch I am...  I was glad to see some areas marked as ""adults only"".   Honestly, the entire back yard area, with it's tiki bar and  Cheeseburger In Paradise scene, should be off limits to kids.   

The food...  when you're surrounded by the sounds of the ocean and the potential of a full-on frat party breaking out at any minute, you forget that you're there to eat.  And the food was just OK.  Again, I should have gotten a burger as that's clearly their claim to fame.  But my tuna melt was OK.  Nothing in the trio of sides was that great...  again, all just standard fried things.   My friend got a shake, which was only acceptable - overly sweet and doesn't need all that whipped cream.  

Cute little place.  Probably quite a throw down scene if you want to be outdoors and feel like you're camping at a Buffett concert.  I don't.  But I also don't judge if you DO.  Get the burger."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Padaro Beach Grill is everything you would expect from a restaurant basically right on the water in Carpinteria: it's more casual so come through wearing your beach gear and you'll order at the counter, the food options range from tasty burgers and sandwiches to fresh fish and tacos, and the outdoor seating area is huge, with views of the train tracks and the ocean and big tables everywhere designed for large groups. They even have a sandbox for kids (or adults, you do you)!

The menu is pretty extensive but I can't recommend the Pretzel Burger enough--a beef patty with BBQ sauce, chipotle mayo, melted American cheese, and caramelized bourbon onions on a soft and salty warm pretzel bun. Everyone around me agreed that I made the right decision there. And you can't go wrong with any of the sides so you might as well get the Trio, which comes with Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, AND Onion Rings. This is what dreams are made of, folks! 

I can't wait to come back and try the Maui Burger...and the Salmon Sandwich...and the California Burger...and the Fish Tacos...okay, I just can't wait to come back and I plan to eat everything here next time. Everything looked (and tasted) delicious!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food was very good. Great place for a family as the kids can get up and run around. Staff was very accomdating to changes to the menu. Service was prompt despite a wedding going on at the same time we were there. Had Prime Burger, caesar salad, bbq chicken salad, fish tacos, cobb salad."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I love the atmosphere! The burger I got was epic. Simple but the meat was quality and fast service. Will definitely recommend this!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Careful, they'll charge you for asking to leave something OFF.
Next time, if there is a next time (doubtful), I'll leave it on and throw it away. So much for trying to not be wasteful."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Was leaving Santa Barbara heading to Ventura.  We were hungry so decided to stop in Carpinteria.  So glad we did, this place was a mini oasis.   Ocean view,  picnic tables,  great atmosphere!  Had the Salmon burger and it was so good! Definetly going back."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Loved this place! Couldn't ask for a better lunch stop off on our way back from SB to LA. Plenty of socially distanced outdoor seating, safe sanitizing practices and a wonderful beach ambiance. I had the Beach club chicken sandwich. Sourdough was toasted perfectly, generous avocado and juicy grilled chicken. Onion rings were crunchy and tasty! Bf had the fried chicken sandwich on brioche and was just as yummy! Definitely recommend this place! What a gem!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Family friendly, great food, friendly staff,and you can't beat the atmosphere or the sand for the kids to play in."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Had the shrimp tacos.. yum.  Looking forward to a burger next time though. I was eyeing my friend's with envy. Will definitely be back. Atmosphere is very relaxed and pleasant, not trendy.. just down to earth, good stuff."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"You come here for the ambience. As every other review states, they're in a pretty plush spot and on a beautiful Cali day, it can't be beat. You can let the kids frolic in the fenced-in grassy area complete with sand box and sand toys while you soak in the beach weather. I'm thinking that the great spot here makes everything taste just a bit better. The food is hit and miss I think, but they do have a great beer selection, with some awesome local craft brews. Service is usually pretty good too as I always get smiling, courteous help at the register and at the food pick-up.

That being said, it can be a pain to come in sometimes. I dread trying to come on weekends for lunch; if you're hungry, don't bother. Even if you can find a parking spot anywhere close, prepare to wait for a dreadful amount of time in the line. 

If you still have room after you meal, make sure to get an ice cream shake, you won't regret it; unless the line is too long that is."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"took a spontaneous roadtrip up the coast and came across this gem on good old yelp!!! 

food was great and the view was amazing...

will definitely be back..."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good food, friendly staff, nice scenery! Definitely recommend stopping by to get a bite to eat"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Beautiful spot with a GORGEOUS view and amazing food! I discovered this place after getting a tip from a friend and she was absolutely right. I will be making this one of my regular stops on my trips up the coast from now on. The prices on their menu are very reasonable as well for the quality and amount you get. Can't wait to go back!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I just love the Padaro Grill.  I have been a fan and customer for years.  My kids have had birthday parties here and more.  There have been at least three changes of management during that time.  Yet each team has clearly honored the vibe of the place : Beach aloha spirit, really good food, carefully sourced,  and reasonable prices.  Mahalo."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"First things first, if you don't like kids, definitely don't come here. If you have kids, definitely come here. There's lots of families around and play areas for the kids. There's also a dog area and an adults only patio (still a lot of kids around there and fills up quick from what I saw). 

Now, for the food. Good sized portions and fast service. I got the shrimp tacos and my fiancé got the fish tacos and a ""side prime burger"". Idk who gets a burger as a side but that's his words LOL! The tacos had nice big fresh slices of avocado on them (yummy) and the sauce they put on it was fabulous - kind of like a sour cream and ranch. The shrimp and fish both tasted very fresh, no fishiness at all. The burger was solid and well cooked. Came with caramelized onions and pickles, plus some sauce on it. He added ketchup, but I think it was appropriately sauced without the ketchup. 

The drink menu is great, everything from wine and beer to fun margaritas! The rosé I had was very refreshing, and my fiancés pacifico came with a lime! Our dog enjoyed all the activity and the outdoor space. 

Could have done with less screaming kids, but the food was worth it!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Loved our lunch here. Restaurant sits right on the beach and they have great outdoor seating with a huge grassy area and huge sandbox that kids can play in while adults visit and eat. Fish tacos were delicious. Husband enjoyed fish and chips. Great selection of food and drinks available. With our beautiful sunny weather here I definitely would recommend a visit here.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place is every dad and mom's dream! You can enjoy a quiet meal while your kids play in the sand area; which is in the center of the tables outside. The portions are huge and the food is good! Bring your babies and your appetite!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Totally blown away by this place. We came here for lunch on a Sunday with the kids. Huge outdoor area with trees and sand and places for kids to play, and areas for parents to drink. They were having a small birthday party at the time and it didn't bother us at all (this place is huge).

Got the hickory smoked bacon burger and it was great.

Good prices, good food, good vibes, ocean side view!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This was my second visit, and we had lunch driving through town. Good beer selection, food was fresh and tasty. Had calamari, chili fries, and a pretzel burger, one beer for two of us. It was more than we could eat entirely. The outdoor eating area was busy and really nice, albeit loud with lots of kids running around. Seems like a great family spot, with a large sand pit area for kids to play in. The ocean is on the other side of a tall hedge. Weather was perfect. Would swing by again in the future - but they need to get their bathroom situation under control, only 2 for the large hopping customer base they have. We waited longer in the bathroom line than we had to wait for our food, by far."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great setting for families, tasty food, reasonable price. Relaxing tables in a park like area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is my second time.  Here's a great stop when on a coastal road trip. The food is yummy and the vibe is super casual. 

Since I've been here last, they have added a really awesome vegan menu!  I had the crab cake sandwich.  Totally tastes like a crab cake. Kind of also tastes like tuna.  I also had the tater tots. They were prepared well. 

My husband had the chicken club sandwich.  He said it was good.  He had the onions. I had one. It was good too. 

I ordered the lime margarita.  Holy smokes! It's strong!! Wow!  Strong but very tasty. 

Next time I'm driving up or down the coast, I'll make it a point to come here again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Go-to place... airy with outdoor dining and beach views. They are not in business to sell cheap tourist food, Usually have the fish'n'chips but the burgers are tasty and all the sides are too.  It is not fast food, so be prepared to wait for good, tasty food. Not excessively long, but it is being prepared thoughtfully. Loved the nachos too. Parking can be tricky, but Santa Claus Lane is like that. Relax and enjoy. Bring your dog, it's ok."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Perfect spot for myself and my two kids. Shrimp tacos are what my kids only want from that place and or the kids chicken nuggets. Fish tacos and the burgers with a beer with the chips and salsa are a must.

Wonderful outside setting for families."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Nice location. Good deck. Disappointing that they do not allow dogs even though they have an outside location
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped on our way home from Morro Bay. Nice little spot, seating inside or out (which I recommend). Casual dinning with great ocean view. We ordered the club and double burger, very delicious and not too pricey. We will definitely stop here again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The outdoor dining area is amazing. This was our view as we ate, right on the beach. And the burger and chicken sandwich was VERY good, and you can't go wrong with their regular or sweet potato fries. Definitely returning if I pass through town again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"We placed a large order. When we arrived to pick up at the time stated on the app, we still had to wait 20 minutes. When the food was ready, we were assured that it was correct. Since they were so sure in their conviction that they were right, we didn't double check. At that point we wanted out of there. Lo and behold, we were missing one whole meal and two sides! Since you can't call them because their answering machine flat out says "" don't leave a message"" we went back. They knew they screwed up, and handed us a bag. But guess what... it was still wrong! 

We want to support you during this trying time. But if you're going to put all your eggs in the ""take out basket"", please get it right."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Came on New Years Day worth my daughter and a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend. Great burgers...nice beachside seating. Enough said.b
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome beach city atmosphere, great burgers! 95% of the seating is outdoors with plenty of sunshine and great views of the Channel Islands. Most are familiar with downtown Carp, but just a few more minutes north at Santa Claus Lane, this little gem is tucked away in a prime beachside spot. Enjoy!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place to go with the family! Outside seating is huge! Best burger I think I've had besides Hawaii! I got the California burger! Son got the Padaro burger ""like ta western burger"". Chili cheese fries huge. Best tarot tots I've tried. The beer was excellent!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Good place to pull off the 1 when you gotta go to the bathroom and really starvin!

+If your a family thats got young kids, there is a massive sand pit for them to run around in and tire themselves out
+Perfectly portioned food
+Fresh ingredients/ not oily
+Beautifully placed on a beach

Conclusion: We could have waited til we got the Santa Barbera to get more of a selection, however when nature calls this place wasn't a bad choice

A-OK."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Great location, family friendly, lovely to eat outside, some good menu choices, BUT - a very poor system for ordering! I often stand in line for 20 to 30 minutes while people ask many questions about the menu choices. There are often only two people handling all orders, sometimes only one person, and they need to take the orders, get the drinks - it is the slowest service I have encountered. The line sometimes goes out the door and moves very, very slowly. Too bad - because you can't beat the location and family atmosphere."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place really has it all if you are a beach person or not.  They have a section for your dog to hang w you while you enjoy their fare.  Varied menu and always specials that really are special.  Friend had the burger special and I had the ono fish tacos.  I am an onion ring fan and theirs do the trick.  Everything tasted fresh, made on the spot.  Speaking of spots, there are a ton of options where to sit including and especially looking out at the ocean.  I'd like to go there at night and enjoy how pretty their grounds are.  Perfect kid spot, they have areas for the kids to play, feels safe, perfect date spot, perfect family and friends spot.  Going for years and never disappointed!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"First time eating here and we loved it! Kids had kids meals (plenty of food and kids enjoyed). The rest had tri-tip fries (delicious and a ton of food), chili cheese fries (super good) and Maui burger (delicious and a fresh slice of pineapple!). Not too pricy either. Highly recommend. Employees were very friendly and helpful. Who doesn't like eating at the beach?!?"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Easy off the 101 place for quick lunch or dinner.  Good fish tacos and tuna melts plus lots of fried foods.

They serve beer here too, just pace yourself as there is only one bathroom for each sex.  The lines for the bathrooms are longer than the food line.

Parking is at a premium here.  Be prepared to walk.

Nice atmosphere for lunch though."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is without a doubt my wife and my's favorite place to stop for a bite to eat whether we are in Carpenteria. 
Not only is the food incredible, but the location and scenery really makes you feel like you're on vacation in Hawaii. Restaurants like this are really hard to find these days in California. 

FOOD/DRINK: This place serves several types of salads, burgers, sandwiches, and fish tacos. All the food is amazing and you really can't go wrong on anything, but I would definitely recommend the tri tip fries. Padaro has plenty of drinks to offer, alcoholic and non alcoholic. Some of the food specials are seasonal and change which is also fun.
LOCATION: Seating is informal and mostly outdoors with picnic tables which are first come first serve. There is a sand pit for kids to play in and an adults only section with a fire pit at the back for those want to avoid kids. They have a speaker to call out your food number which can be heard from anywhere on the restaurant grounds. Great view of the ocean!

If you come here, you won't be able to stop coming every time you're in the area!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Tuna melt was decent. Bread was a not crisp for a melt. terrific view however.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,It's been several years since I've been to this place. I definitely wanted to show my boyfriend Padaro and it's exactly the same as how it was 8 years ago! The environment is kid and family friendly. We got ourselves some fish and chips which definitely had more fish to batter ratio which is always a plus. The onion rings were perfectly friend and crispy! The burger was massive and always hard to take that first bite. So glad that I was able to come back
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Super good food, even better atmosphere! Everything is reasonably priced, scenery and seating is amazing. Went here three days in a row during my stay in Montecito."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Hands down one of the best restaurants around! The food is delicious and we have never had a dish we didn't like. Wide variety of menu items. The patio has reopened and it's like being on vacation in Hawaii! The staff is always friendly and helpful. Best of all is that they are practicing excellent precautions, requiring masks to enter, proper social distancing, and disinfecting every table as soon as a guest leaves. This has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated! That's what keeps us coming back time after time. Keep up the good work, and thanks!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is always so consistent.  The staff are always friendly and make sure we feel welcome.  The food is so good.  The grilled fish tacos are my go to here, never have once been disappointed.  I recommend this place over and over again and will continue to do so.  Thank you guys for doing it right!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Excellent place if you are looking for delicious food and good drinks. The view is spectacular!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Such a cute place to sit outside with an ocean view in Carpinteria. They have a little sand area outside where children can play ( family friendly). You order your food first and then sit. The food is tasty! I got the chicken burger which was tasty. The fish and chips are average according to my husband. Overall a place I would definitely visit again to try more items. 

Just a heads up! The parking is very limited so that can be a challenge."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Very good burgers!  Sweet potato fries!!  Salads are very good and generous portioned!!  Great weather. Nice wine selection. Sand pit for the kids! (well worth it).  The sound of waves crashing!!   Beware of the birds. They have anti bird devices but them seagulls are crafty!!  But just like at the beach you gotta watch your stuff. Also fun when the train blows by!!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Yummy place to eat! Burgers are Fabulous! Service is Fast & very Friendly! Sit outside near the beach! As a Lucky Local, I always come back for the Turkey burger w/grilled caramelized onions, Avocado, melted cheese wrapped in a Lettuce-wrap...a little messier than w/a bun, but who needs the x-tra bread when this Tastes Sooo Good!! 

*Throw a little Cholula hot sauce on & Good 2 Go!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Have a kid and want to enjoy a drink while they entertain themselves? This is the place for you. We bought our 1 year old twice over the weekend and loved the atmosphere as much as our babe. Fish tacos were really good. BBQ Chicken salad was meh. Oreo shake OUT OF THIS WORLD. Truthfully, who cares what they serve... being able to have a drink in peace while my toddler plays with other kids is priceless."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great atmosphere (totally laid back)!! Great food !! On the south side of the 101 fwy is this great place with lots of variety from burgers to tacos, seafood to vegan options. Check it out on yelp. My prime beef burger w/ tatie tot side was delicious!! A definite come back when I'm traveling in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great healthy food with a park outside to eat in, and experience an exquisite view of the ocean. (Too bad that Tiki Bar isn't a summer night destination! These days, it's just for scenery...Can envision Gidget there.)Just be sure to NOT go on a Saturday or Sunday during the summer months. The long line of tourists will keep you from being able to order food, for a long long wait. Just so ya know: They have internet, and different areas of tHe park for people with pets, and for people with kids (playground too) and an area just for adults wirh no smaller others!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A must when out in the Santa Barbara area. This place is in a little strip that is directly off the freeway, you exit and it's just the strip and then the next entrance to the freeway, lol it was a trip! But anyway, they have a beautiful garden with outdoor dining. You order your food at the front counter. The line went by fast and we found a table pretty quickly, had great shade and our food was ready in under 15 min. I had the fish n chips, cooked perfectly. Golden crispy outside and juicy on the inside! The fries were good. Hubby had the nachos and they were delish. The kids had mini corn dogs, so happy they had this on the menu, made our dinner so pleasant lol. The beach is right behind the garden, it's so peaceful, I bet it's great at night with their dangling lights!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Location location location-  beautiful grounds - grass-fed beef I-  would definitely be willing to come back here again and again - and it's a place you could bring a book and just relax
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic place for my boys to play and all of us to eat lunch what a great  idea to have huge sand box and picnic tables so we could all hang out and eat 
Thank you Padaro Beach Grill"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Food is ok. The atmosphere is ruined by the obnoxious practice of calling out the numbers for the food.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A great summer hot spot. The seating is outdoor picnic bench style and there is plenty of room for the kids to run around. I always get the shrimp tacos and a beer. They used to have a problem with seagulls (a gull swooped down and stole my son's chicken nuggets lol) but they have since put up fishing wire to keep the birds away. The only thing I don't like is the parking situation. There are many businesses and restaurants along with beach goers vying for too little spaces. Sometimes you have to circle around for a bit. We typically will go at 11 or so, before the lunch crowd."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Worst service I've had in years.

My girlfriend and I went to the Padaro Beach Grill for a casual meal tonight.  She's pregnant, and wanted something both vegetarian and non-spicy. She asked the girl at the counter if the black bean burger was spicy.  The reply was ""no.""  
I ordered the pretzel burger with no cheese (I am lactose intolerant).  
We also ordered fries and a side salad.
Nothing about the order was good.
The fries were cold.  I'd be surprised if they were made less than half an hour prior to our order.
My girlfriend's black bean burger was covered in a spicy sauce that made it difficult for her to eat. 
And of course my burger was covered in cheese.  Now, mistakes happen.  That's not a huge problem by itself.  The real problem was how they handled their mistake.  I asked them to re-make my burger without cheese.  They told me they would do so.  
It came back out suspiciously quickly.  Sure enough, they hadn't re-made anything, they just scraped (some of) the cheese off the burger.  At this point I was getting angry.  I went back inside to point out that they hadn't actually re-made the burger like I asked, and again told them to do just that.
Again, the burger came out suspiciously quickly.  They still hadn't re-made the burger.  They'd just replaced the top bun.  That, of course, does nothing to remove the melted cheese on the actual burger, or mixed into the onions, sauce, bottom bun, etc.

Worst service in years.  Inedible food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Perfect Destination for families with young children. I absolutely love that they have a playground and park where kids can play while you enjoy some great food.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Probably one of the best vegan cheese burgers I've ever had. The fries were pretty standard and ice tea was delicious. Beautiful beach scenery. I'll definitely be back.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What is better than a beach front grill with great food? The Padaro Beach Grill offers everything from burgers to salads, with a variety of appetizers as well. Once you have ordered you have the opportunity to sit where ever you please. From the outside decks, to the near the sand pit for children, or even indoors. The restaurant is very neatly organized, with friendly staff as well. If you are not wanting to sit ocean view, then you can sit by their very own pond.

Let's talk food! I have been to Padaro multiple times and love their burgers! They are simple, but perfect for a sunny day. This go around I had a burger with lettuce and grilled onions. It was cooked perfectly, and was also very juicy. I grabbed a cup of Iced Tea to go with this great meal. As an appetizer I had a few sweet potato fries, which were just as tasty.

This is a great restaurant to families, couples, or even a stroll by yourself! It is a kid friendly atmosphere, but has an adult only deck to get away from the children if you please. I would recommend it to all that are prepared for a delicious meal and great scenery!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Absolutely amazing view & amazing food! Even during quarantine this place was still up to par. This is absolutely a repeat spot. 10/10
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"No better place to take the kids, enjoy outdoor seating right on the ocean and prices aren't exorbitant! Great food and unbeatable ambiance. We enjoyed the food and a beer or two while the kids played in the outdoor sandbox. Meals are under $10!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Look no further, such a cute spot with outdoor tables and chairs. Someone cleans them after every use. Everything we had was amazing!! Just the right batter on the fish and chips. Fries were fried so perfectly!!Calamari was also fried to perfection! My boys got corn dogs and even that was delicious! We had a cookie shake and a strawberry shake. The flavor for both is one of the best I've EVER tasted with just the right amount of thickness. We also tried their strawberry smoothies as a dessert, and it was just right, not too sweet. My husband had a beer not exactly sure what it was but it was very refreshing and crispy. Next time he wants to try a darker beer. Overall we loved the vibe, very relaxing with delicious food!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I really like this place. Great place for fish tacos or burgers with your family. Great place for kids! Bring a jacket if you are planning to sit outside. It is owned by the same owners of The Habit burger spots. If you read my review of the Habit, I was not impressed at all with the Habit. But this place has waaay better food. People are amazing and service is great. We were supposed to go tonite but it got too late. I can't wait to go back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Good food and great setting.  Love that  the kids can play while the adults enjoy their food.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I've tried the pretzel, maui and padaro burger and they all hit the spot! My favorite is the maui because the pineapple really adds a fresh taste and goes well with teriyaki. Serving sizes are generous. Love how they have many options from fish to salads to chili. Something here for everyone to enjoy  Thank you to all the essential workers at Padaro Beach Grill, you guys rock"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Awesome spot! I had the California chicken sandwich and an order of fries. I love the ambiance and location. Very laid back place and beautiful scenery.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,My husband and I love coming here with our daughter when we are craving fish and chips. Their food is always fresh and delicious. I love the casual beachy atmosphere and that a majority of the seating it outside. It's clean and accommodating and the service is always quick. For the past couple visits I have gotten the vegan burger and it is seriously delicious which surprised me because most vegan burgers are not very good. They serve it in lettuce instead of a bun as well and normally I wouldn't prefer that but it's actually really good. I would definitely recommend this place
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great spot for kids, families, and couples.
Parking looks ominous but usually works out,
lines are long but move nicely,
find a spot outside while you wait with your pager,
Let the little ones play in the sand in the back,
and enjoy the ocean breeze, sunshine, and vibe.

This beach grill is legit!  The staff is friendly, and the food is pretty good. 

They also have tacos made to order on some days that you don't have to wait in the regular line for.  I passed on them because they were pricier than the regular menu.

My wife enjoyed her shrimp and avocado salad,
I loved my Roasted Chile Burger, and my boys attacked their kids meals. You can get a burger, quesadilla, mini corn dogs, grilled cheese or chicken tenders.  Kids also get to choose if they want fries, apple sauce or salad for a side.  Kiddos will also love the fresh lemonade, choc milk, juice or soda so bring them in.

Never been here?
Get here.  Now :)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great great great!
Atmosphere-  A
Food           -  B
Service       -  B+

Its a lovely place to eat. The eating area outside is WONDERFUL and you are literally steps from the beach.

I got the shrimp tacos and house salad
The shrimp tacos were okay. The shrimp was fresh, but the taco itself was bland. It needed a definite kick. A better sauce over the taco would of made it perfection. I put pico de gallo on it and it was good. The salad was okay too. My companion got the California burger, and french fries. His burger was big, and delicious. The french fries were good and they dont use bottled ranch which is great! 

Overall I thought the place was great. I'll change my order next time and I'll know I'll end up loving the food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A little piece of heaven on earth! I believe they are owned by the same folks who run The Habit and the Hook Burger Bistro, so you get the same service with a smile and the same delicious, great quality food. Bring all your out of town visitors here for a real California-chill experience.

Do watch out for the seagulls, though--some of them are pretty aggresive. A woman seated next to us had one bold bird swoop in and snatch the top right off of her burger! Hope he got heartburn. I didn't see them snatch and carry away any kids from the play area, however."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food is tasty, outdoor chill atmosphere, tropical garden with casual picnic tables and umbrellas.  Two thumbs down for the gratingly high pitched voice announcing the order numbers that are ready to be picked up."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Delicious burgers with gourmet buns. We had the Prime which had grilled onions & the California with red pepper & avo, fries, chocolate malt & Cabernet. Beautiful view of the sunset which we enjoyed as they gave us a pager to let us know when our food was ready. I think it was even better than the old Habit in I.V."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The fried food was crispy and perfect, and even though it was crowded we were able to get a table. Really enjoyable. Parking was a little difficult; you might have to make a u-turn in the street to find spots. There were plenty of spots but it was extremely crowded at 2pm on a Friday."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Padaro burger is the shizzle. It's everything I could've ever imagined the best most fantastic  burger could be. The bun is delightful. The Chipotle mayo is a sympathy of flavor. The cheddar cheese, bacon, bbq sauce, and let's not forget the onion ring. My life will never be the same. I've died and gone to heaven."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Called in an order, the person taking the order was very nice. Once we arrived, no wait they had the food ready very fast. Also, maybe had to do with not many people at that hour, as soon as we left people started to trickle in. 
Overall, BBQ chicken salad was very good, my kid ordered his burger and fries. Will be back soon to eat at their outdoor dining. Food was great, service was on efficient, this is a repeat for sure."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is a fun spot to visit while staying up in Carpinteria.. 
We just had a couple drinks but the food looked great!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Located right off the freeway along the 101 this little gem offers great food at reasonable prices. You order at the counter and take a number to your seat. Seating is all outdoors with palm tree forests surrounding you. The seating area faces the ocean so you'll enjoy a great sea breeze and view. They offer sandwiches, burgers, salads and tacos. Hubby liked their bacon cheese burger with a grilled homemade beef patty, tomato, lettuce, pickles with his choice of cheese and crispy bacon on a fresh brioche type bun. $10.95 with no sides. I had the grilled yellowtail burger with tomatoes, onions, pickles, tartar sauce and lettuce on a fresh brioche bun. Of course we had fries- 3/8"" cut fried just right served with little cups of ketchup. They serve wine and beer but we passed- they called our number within about 15 minutes and they close at 7 pm so plan accordingly. Great find. Bathrooms are open and very clean. Highly recommend for a quick bite at reasonable prices in a nice surf vibe location. Probably not handicap friendly as much of the seating is located in sand, but there is some on concrete."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome location with great food, fun drink options and endless play time for your kid and/or fur baby. The atmosphere is truly perfect"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great food and atmosphere. We love stopping here when we are in town. So much delicious food to choose from and they are right off the highway.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"No longer a dog friendly establishment! Decided to go here when I read from other yelp reviews that they allow dogs. Padaro's is nonfriendly and very nonsupportive of those needing emotional support animals - questioning you if you really need one! If you don't want to be harassed, avoid this place! Additionally, one employee said it was fine. Told by another that it is unacceptable. Despite the views of the ocean, go somewhere else if you're looking for a good experience and decent food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Meh! The food is subpar and I feel like the only thing that people like about this place is that their kids can run wild while parents can have a beer or a margarita. We ordered the guacamole and chips and fish and chips and it was pretty greasy. There was a couple next to us that had a burger that looked pretty good and I was bummed I didn't get that. But as far as the fried food it was all very greasy and we didn't finish our meals.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The burgers are so good! they are super filling too. I would order their barbecue burger. The barbecue burger comes  with deep fried onions, grilled onions, and they give a generous amount of cheese and avocado which I loved! I also enjoyed their California Burrito but I liked their barbecue burger more.

The fries are alright it could be better but the burgers are the real star of this restaurant. I would order their tater tots and onion rings over their fries.

The restaurant is close by Santa Claus beach. It is a perfect place to eat outside they have a lovely view of the ocean and they also have a lot of tables and benches outside. 

Note: There may be a longer wait time on the weekend. They have a few parking spots available. They offer dine in and  take out orders."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We were traveling from Southern California to Northern California and decided to drive 101 instead of I5. Places like this make it totally worth it to add about an hour to the drive. Instead of a chain restaurant at the foot of the grapevine, I got to eat at a picnic table right next to the ocean! 

My family had burgers and one had the chicken club. We laughed when my daughter said the chicken sandwich was like the one she always gets at habit burger as I read in another review that there's a connection to the original creator of our favorite chain burger spot. They all loved their food. My husband had the pretzel burger and was in heaven. 

I saw a catch of the day fish sandwich and was eager to give it a try. I should have guessed when the guy at the counter seemed confused when I asked what fish was the fish of the day. He said for the sandwich I could have salmon or mahi mahi. The bread was super fresh, the tarter sauce amazing but the fish was just meh. This review would be 5 stars if the fish was actually a fresh fish of the day. Would be good to update the menu just to say fish sandwich. I have a certain expectation when it says fish of the day. I would have rather ordered some of the other yummy food knowing the fish wasn't super fresh. 

I am an avid Yelper so I found this place through the Yelp app. Everyone said the fish and chips was great so we ordered that as our side to share with the table and it did not disappoint. Some of the best fish I've had as a fish and chips dish. And have I mentioned the tarter sauce? Great! 

The seating is fun, outdoor area is large and plenty of picnic tables. Great location for people with groups or small kids. 

Would definitely stop here again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A cute little beach stop! We passed the ought Carpinteria on our way to SLO from LA for lunch. My husband had the fish and chips and I had a chicken quesadilla. We both had draft beers. $32.00 for the whole meal, which we found reasonable given the cute picnic style outdoor seating and the picturesque ocean view. Better than a fast food stop on a road trip! Recommend this for a quick in-out lunch experience,"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I had the Padaro burger and it was great. The fries, onion rings and calamari were good too. You couldn't ask for a better location, although it would be better if you could see the ocean without having to stand up, but still the location is awesome. I would have given 5 stars, but they don't allow dogs which doesn't make any sense to me. It's outside and there's plenty of space. Makes it hard for people who like to do things with their dogs. Other than that it was great."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Everything was amazing and fresh, also fairly priced. They have a nice seating area outdoors that overlooks the ocean and when the train passes. Definitely a must if you're on this side of town."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Expected more of this restaurant knowing it's owned by the folks who started The Habit and Hook Burger. Food was okay but not willing to stop and find parking to eat there again. Should have driven the extra 1 1/4 hours to get home and eat at home.

Modifying review because owner contacted me and wanted to make things right. Kudos to them and that's worth a couple of stars for caring! Will give them another chance when in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is one of my personal favorite restaurants! They, of course, require a mask to enter and they clean each table after one or one's group leave. They offer hand sanitizer commonly. The experience is priceless. Order inside the beach house themed restaurant to be greeted with lush greenery and flowers outdoors. When you retrieve your food, sit on a picnic table seeing the Pacific beyond. I tried the shrimp tacos which came with chips and salsa. They were excellent; the creamy sauce unified the shrimp with the cilantro and cabbage. The salsa is the perfect amount of flavor and spiciness. I also tried the fish n' chips. The crunchy battered fish tasted great with their delicious homemade tartar sauce. I appreciate their efforts to make sure that their customers have a great time while staying safe and sanitary."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is such a great place to spend the day! It is more like a park in a restaurant, so much sitting everywhere, and places for the kids to play. I've use, their community and stable tables as well as high tops and a large sand pit with toys for the kids to play in. Plenty of easy parking, the prices are very fordable, especially for being by the beach. Our burgers and salads were absolutely delicious, the tater tot's very tasty too. The fish and chips was fantastic, I would order that again.Service is wonderful, food was made to order quickly. Highly recommend it if you were passing through the area!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"we came for a little stroll while passing by on the way back home from our solvang trip. this is a little stripe of shops and a restaurant right by the beach.the area is VERY chill.  we arrived just before lunch on a sunday and while there was no crowd at first, it got pretty busy by lunch time. 

we had some beer (island brew) and sweet potato fries and sat in the outdoor area overlooking the beach. it was a beautiful day! the entire dining area is pretty much outdoors. they have picnic tables with umbrellas and a little play area for the kids. i noticed this place is very popular with families with little kids. 

their beer on draft was approx $3 for a pint and even though we didnt eat anything other than just the side of fries, everything on their menu were big in portion and cheap! it's definitely worth a quick stop here if you ever pass by."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wonderful spot with a great atmosphere. Can't believe we hadn't checked it out before last weekend. Sadly it was a super windy day so we didn't get to enjoy the location as much as we would have liked but we will certainly return. The boyfriend and I each got the Beach Club and we shared The Trio, which is sweet potato fries, regular fries and onion rings; everything was delicious. Can't wait to spend an afternoon there on a day when the wind isn't so insane."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great service and awesome job keeping up with COVID-19 regulations! There were hand sanitizers at the cashier counter and outdoor seating was spaced out more than 6 feet. The restaurant is right off the 101 freeway with lots of parking, just be sure to read the parking signs or you'll get towed. 
The grilled fish tacos are really good! Fish tasted fresh, though could have used more seasoning. The chips and salsa were tasty too. My boyfriend had the vegan chick'n sandwich in sourdough and he loved it. Overall great experience at Padaro!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Open! Awesome ambiance with ocean views and not a ton of people. Wear mask, bring your sanitizer and enjoy the delicious food and drink by the sea. Friendly staff. Fast service (Saturday only waited about 20 mins)

Order, wait, then take your food and find a picnic table. Nice patio & lawn seating."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Love the burger and fries. Also but couldn't help try the mini corn dogs I got for my son and was pleasantly surprised.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My husband brought us here and it was a fun experience! We had Outdoor seating under an umbrella and sat at picnic tables. There's a play area for the kids to hang out in the sand. Free Parking along the street, but can be hard to find. Be patient. We ordered:

1) fish & chips, 3 pieces of red snapper & fries - perfectly cooked! Tastes great with tarter or malt vinegar 
2) padaro burger, super good, Smokey bacon, avocado was piled high
3) island blonde draft beer 16 oz
4) corona

You bus your own tray afterwards!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Came here yesterday with my best friend + boyfriend. The patio area is so cute! We ordered the Calamari which was $9.95 (worth it!!), 2 milkshakes, and 3 burgers and sweet potato fries. They have vegan / veggie options too which is super cool! They have a grown ups only area which makes sense since they also have backyard-type play area with sand and toys for the kids. I'd recommend this place to anyone! It was great! The train does pass by every so often, but I think we over looked it because we had a great time!

Attached is a photo of the view! (They had a bonfire area, but I didn't get a picture of it unfortunately)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Our favorite place in the Ventura/Santa Barbara area.  Great atmosphere, kids play area, outdoor seating with lots of large trees and ocean views.  The food is good and not overpriced.  We love the hamburgers and fish tacos and the have great kids meals."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"WAY BETTER THAN A TYPICAL IN N OUT BURGER. Finally got a burger thats better than In N out WOW isnt that crazy?! Came here on Saturday with my new girlfriend who I just asked out at the beach before coming here. I was looking at restraunts to try out around the beach and saw this joint, I didnt have craves for a burger but according to yelp this spot was popular so we came through here. The prices on the menu meets where it should be at except for the ancohol drinks such a rip off way over price. Like a 8oz cup for Margarita. The atmosphere is really nice and brings that beachy vibe little bit of hawaiin but more like that Tommy Bahama vibes. Outdoor seating is available and really nice but either way the outdoor seating is part of the restraunt anyways. Restroom is also available. Parking is a little tight, gets busy. Also you kind of get a view of the beach.

The Burger: before I got to this joint I actually wanted the pretzel burger but I was actually having a hawaiin crave when I saw the Maui Burger so I tried the Maui burger. It was really good, the burger was really presentable, it was juicy , the pineapple was lightly fried and the bun was nice and soft doesnt look soggy. My girlfriend has the regular burger they served there she said she liked it better than In N out also. 

Tater tots: they were crunchy , not a big deal. 

Sweet potato and regular fries: the sweet potato fries were actually good and lightly sweet and the regular fries they have this type of seasoning they put on it . But sweet potato fries is a must try. 

Drinks: I order a Mango Margarita it was actually pretty good , barely can taste the ancohol it was nice sweet to it. My girlfriend ordered the Pina Colada it was really nasty! I Didnt like it at all and also almost $8 - $10 for like a 8oz cup of a mixed drink. Not worth it at all, as much i actually liked the magarita I shouldve gotten a beer or a regular drink. I also tried a beer calls the ""Topo topo""? Correct me if im wrong . But it was Okay , I would drink it again but apperently thats there popular house beer.

Customer serivce: This is where I was going to rate a 4 star out of 5 but this blonde employee who was serving from the window saved the joint from getting a 4 star. She made it up for me she was really nice. When I order fries I asked the register for Sweet Potato fries but they gave me regular fries instead so I went back to the window and told them that I ordered sweet potato fries. She said i can have the regular fries and gave me my sweet potato fries and since I was waiting for the fries aside of the window she came back and told me if i want anything to drink since ive been waiting. I was actually pissed off because of the drinks were such a rip off but anyways she offered me a drink and I told her ""surprise me"" and she gave me the ""topo topo"" beer that she said its their popular beer. Because I got free fries and a beer they made it up for it and espicially that employee's service she did great. Without her helpfulness It wouldve been a 4 star. 

Next time put how many OZ cup for mixed drinks or atleast tell your customers. Because I can pay $8 to $12 for a  12- 16oz on a mix drink."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a cute beachside food shack. That's a bit of a stretch, it's a small but the grounds it sits on is huge. Lots of picnic tables a sand pit for the kids. There's a stage out back and 2 adults only sections. This place is perfect for a late lunch, it's Situated right next to the train tracks, so you can feel the ocean breeze, hear the waves crashing and watch the pacific surf liner come by. 
The food is pretty cheap, burgers for $6, 2 grilled shrimp tacos for $10. The shrimp was juicy and piled high with cabbage and avocado. A side of chips came with it too!
I loved this hidden gem! Great spot! Check it out!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Lovely spot to enjoy an outdoor meal! 
Great service and onion rings and maui burger were super tasty.  
Definitely recommend!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Very casual place to grab a great burger. I had the pretzel burger and my sweetie had the California Burger. Both were great. Lots of guac on the CA burger. Felt safe with beach seating. Clean. Great staff.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"So it was our first time coming here today.  We had a bit of unusual occurrence.  My daughter ordered a turkey burger with grilled onion and a side of avocado.  As she lifted up the bun to spread her avocado, she noticed a giant metal sheet pan head screw and a metal flat washer on top of her turkey burger. Not sure how it got there and why it was there, but we quickly marched back to the counter and gave it back to the manager.  Can you imagine your child eating/swallowing a metal washer and screw?  It was very upsetting as a mommy.  Wish I took a photo but again I was upset and confused, I wanted to see the manager right away.  The manager apologized and gave us a refund for the burger and made a new burger for my daughter. She also offered her a drink on the house.   Glad she resolved and corrected the issue.  Overall I still gave it a 4 star because the food we ordered between my friend's family and my family were delicious and flavorful and great price for the amount of food we got.  But safety wise/ finding metal screw and flat washer on your food was unacceptable and scary.  Maybe double check your food first before eating or giving it to your child especially if they're younger. Thank goodness my daughter is good about inspecting her food first before taking a big bite."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Excellent fish and chips, fish and shrimp tacos, onion rings, pina coladas, burgers and chocolate malts..... Hawaiian vibe with excellent outdoor seating.....quick service even with long lines...."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"First timers. Food was great! Scenery is beautiful. Loved how coordinated the tables and palm trees were placed.
We'll be back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We had great customer service here, great food, and the outdoor seating was awesome. We will definitely be visiting the area again and this is absolutely one of the places we will be going back to!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Such a perfect location! Right on the beach, lots of outdoor seating under all the palm trees, and dog friendly. The food is great quality and very cheap too.

We got a burger, fish & chips, nachos, and the yellowtail fish sandwich. The food is really good and soooo cheap for the good quality that you get. Our only complaint is that the nachos didn't come with as many toppings/sauce, and the fish & chips tasted a bit plain. Other than that everything was awesome.

Definitely recommend this place to anyone passing by and looking for good, cheap food with a nice view :)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped by with the family and Had an amazing time. The food came out fast and was very delicious. This place has the best ambiance ever, we will definitely return for some more great food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,I thought the quality of the food was average and the location was excellent. You can order ahead online or just wait in a short line if you are already there. There is ample outdoor seating and widely spaced tables.  I appreciate that they gave plenty of tartar sauce and ketchup. Wait for the food was about 15-20minutes.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Can always count on great fresh food. Amazing they now have a great vegan menu! Love it!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I tried to have a small wedding reception here over a year ago. I emailed the business asking what were the fees for a small wedding. I received a prompt reply saying there were no fees and they would set aside tables for me that I could decorate as I wished. Even when I mentioned that I might have more guests, nothing extra I should be aware of.

The week prior to my wedding I go to scope out how busy it is at that time because parking can be difficult and I have elderly family members. I ask a staff member if she knows where my table will be and she says she doesn't know. I asked if I'll have a round table or a rectangular one so I could get a table cloth and she explains that she doesn't know because they are having another event that day but that's all she knows.

Not once did anyone mention that an event would be happening in the same area. I Google the restaurant and wedding date praying that I wouldn't find anything about a live band playing. Another wedding party pops up. At this point I have 6 days until the wedding and I need to know if they will have amplified sound because I'll need those 6 days to find another venue. So I contact the other bride to find out what I should prepare for since obviously the restaurant can't communicate. It sounds less than ideal but not awful.

The next morning the owner calls to scold me for contacting his private party customers. He acts completely baffled by the fact that I would expect anything for no extra fees and that I didn't understand the fact they were open to the public. He clearly talked down to me and was mad that a low paying party would expect anything really from them. He just kept mentioning that these were paying people and I was lucky to get free tables.

He was completely wrong. Where my wedding ceremony took place was open to the public. In fact when I originally booked the courthouse we found out later the date was shared with another event going on at the building. When I asked about it they said they didn't realize that, moved my date, and noted in the public calendar that that date was not suitable for weddings. I myself work for a public land agency, I have weddings scheduled in public spaces often. I would mention to an inquiring person if a larger event was scheduled near the area they were looking to use.

To me that's just being considerate of others. At Padaro beach grill that doesn't exist unless you are already paying. And I was always willing to pay, my first email asked about fees. I was never given an option, a relative was covering food costs so I wasn't just looking for a free place.

The owner acted like I was a bridezilla for expecting basic communication. My dress was 80 bucks, I had no wedding registry, I did my own hair and makeup. I was not a demanding bride but I think the owner was happier thinking I was than reevaluating the way he handles parties at the restaurant.

After that rude phone call from him I knew I didn't want to deal with such terrible management. I scrambled together to find a nicer restaurant who helped me thoroughly with 5 days notice. It worked out because the food was better as was the ambiance. Long story short, don't have parties here and the owner is not a nice person."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Not dog friendly! Food is good. Local clientele harassed me. Cursed me out in the parking lot.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Simply put, delicious fresh food. An extensive menu of salads, sandwiches, appetizers and burgers. Including some vegan options. Tried the Hawaiian burger and let me tell you it's the burger like no other! I simply can't have enough of this place, the atmosphere is so peaceful and love the outdoor seating area or you can even take your food and eat it at the beach that is just steps away."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Love this beach eatery! Great food at great prices and you can't beat the location! Just added a great Vegan menu too!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Family friendly- lots of sand toys and things to keep the kiddos occupied. Mostly picnic tables outside so it was comfortable for everyone
Beautiful view- we went at sunset. It was a beautiful view of Santa Barbara from the the dinner area
friendly service- they had great suggestions and were very accommodating
delicious food!- excellent variety of burgers, Chicken, and even a vegan menu
Most important to me... Excellent beer selection. Plenty Local beers on tap as well as domestic favorites. Also beer in bottles available."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"TASTY GRUB WITH A RELAXING BEACH VIBE!

Located on Santa Claus Lane, off the 101 Fwy, between Santa Barbara and Ventura.  Back in the day, S.C. Lane was a cool site to see driving on the 101, with over-the-top Christmas decor on all the stores, but nothing related to Scott Calvin on this strip of land at all, anymore. So why exit here anyways?!?  Looks like a decent beach, but that's normal for California.  We gatz good beaches for days!  Another reason to come is this local eats, PADARO BEACH GRILL!  Never heard of it?!?  That's what yelp is for ;) Otherwise, like most drivers rushing by just looking at their phones (unless you're yelpin' of course lol), you'll NEVER KNOW!  Yelp directions are on point.  Most irritating thing about this area is the parking, in a nutshell... it sucks.  It's a free for all, nothing dedicated unless you're handicapped.  The Grill is set up to take care of a lot of peeps, so when finally you score that slot, you're golden!  Counter service for ordering food, and if there's a line to contend with, may wanna have someone in your party snap a pic of the menu options to help speed up the decision process.  Staff is friendly, informative and patient.  Now you gotta just find a spot to cop a squat in their spacious patio.  Definitely sportin' a cool, relaxing beach vibe that kinda transports you away from the stress of The Office Life. And YES... you can hear the beach waves crashing down in the distance!  Too bad there's a wall of bushes that's obstructing your beach view when you sit down, unfortunately.  Alright enuf chit chat... I'm hangry, FEED ME! ;p

HICKORY BURGER: THICK burger served here!  Upon asking how we wanted the hamburger prepared, Pops asked for his beef patty to be @ medium level. I kind of scoff when people ask us this question because it RARELY happens.  Lo and behold though, there was a nice touch of pink to the middle of the patty.  Ok, someone knows how to grill here!  Bacon pieces are thick yet crispy so they break nicely and completely with every bite.  Cheese is melted onto the patty, so a nice ooey gooey consistency.  Then the buns are buttered and grilled.  And the BBQ sauce is not engulfing everything.  REALLY GOOD burger is served here!!  Add to it an order of Onion Rings that are prepared perfectly here!  Panko flakes in the batter, deep fried an eye-pleasing golden brown, not overly greasy... spot on!

COUNTRY CLUB: Yummy sammie!  Comes with good sized FRIED CRISPY chicken breast, moist inside yet not overly greasy. I subbed in Chipotle Mayo for regular Mayo and Sourdough Toast for the Brioche bun.  Thick piece of Jack cheese was nicely melted on top of chicken. wanted to be a lil different, so I got an order of Tater Tots with my sammie. Just like the onion rings, these are prepared swimmingly.  So someone obviously has deep frying skills here!

FISH & CHIPS: They used Red Snapper for today's fish, tempura battered then deep fried Golden brown.  Not sure if that's their standard fish option all the time, but nonetheless, it tasted & looked fresh, not looking like it came straight from a frozen box.  Big pieces sitting on a large serving of French fries. Very filling.  Tartar sauce is tasty.  Good stuff!

QUESADILLA: Served BIG!  So big it was falling off the plate it was served on.  Probably the most impressive visual of what we ordered today.  It's a mix of Cheddar & Monterey Jack melted inside,  topped with dollops of Pico de Gallo, guac, and sour cream.  Standard quesadilla action here, no complaints from its devourer.


EASY RECOMMENDATION!  Best to come on a sunny day, take off your shoes, and wiggle your toes in the sand.  Great to escape for an hour (or two).  The vittles don't take long to arrive.  The grill masters and fryers are skilled at what they do, as all of our food choices were impressively satisfying.  If you can find a parking space, gotta come in for the grub!  Enjoy!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great lunch spot with an array of seating options! Although the place was full of families and kids, they had ""adult only"" sections to find quiet eating spots. The prices were not that bad considering it was a place to eat on the beach & the quality was superb! Overall, I would recommend and will be returning."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We decided to try this place after dropping off some beach rentals next door. Parking is a bit problematic, but it was a good choice. Expansive menu, with lots of burgers and salads. We had shrimp and red snapper tacos. Good flavor, but a bit on the wet side and the tortillas fell apart. We also had the Padaro burger, Hickory burger and California burger, both good. I tried the BBQ chicken salad. It was just OK, and I thought the cucumbers were an odd addition to onion strings and BBQ sauce. Service was good, fast and place was clean. We'd visit again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This spot offers a wide selection of vegan options. The vegan chicken sandwich, the vegan cheeseburger and vegan nachos are my favorite. My favorite part is the patio seating area. Perfect spot to bring the family for beach vibes while you eat. Staff is great as well. Parking can be limited though, especially on the weekend when the beach is packed"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The reason we chose this place to meet up w family was so we could take advantage of the outdoor seating área. It was spacious just like the photos we saw online. We got there about 1/2 hour after they opened, perfect timing. The line got pretty long real fast. We all enjoyed our meals, I was especially happy w my Baja tacos, crunch fried batter w tender red snapper. We had chili cheese fries, a Padaro burger ... next time we will add second patty. It's simple fast food w a nice atmosphere. The order of nachos w tri tip were good but skimpy on the meat. We will definitively come again when we're in town. What a quaint Lil beach town."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Seriously can't beat the space! The restaurant is an awesome mix of dining tables, picnic tables, and bar seating looking at the ocean. Family friendly too! Food is good, solid California club, burgers a cooked well, and fries are always tasty."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This cute restaurant is walking distance from Padaro Beach (as you might imagine) off of Santa Claus Ln. It is reasonably priced for being in such a desirable location and there is plenty of seating. It's an order at the counter spot. The line can get long, but it moves quickly. 

I had the chopped cobb salad and it was delicious!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What's not to love about this place. As soon As I saw that outside seating area I knew I would love this place. I kind of felt like I was on vacation being here. It was a beautiful day. We got a cozy table out back. Those picnic tables and umbrellas are nice. Then our food was ready. Perfect food to compliment our perfect atmosphere. 

I had the turkey burger. It was delicious. The bun was soft. Meat was tasty. Thousand island dressing on the burger was delicious. I was in burger heaven. I like the variety on the menu. Many burgers to choose from. Fries are not included in burger purchase. Veggie and vegan burger options also available. 

I even brought home a burger for my boys. I ordered all the toppings on the side. They loved it. The prices were right on. Beer also available. This will be a must stop place when ever I am passing through. 

Bring the kids. Very kid friend. Kids sand play area outside. There are tables available for reservations for special parties or events."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Padaro Beach Grill has delicious fresh food that seems different than other restaurants. We ran into this place on the side of the highway heading south down to Santa Barbara on Santa Claus Lane. It's right near a cute private little beach, some boutiques, and a surf rental shop. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which came with a yummy teriyaki sauce and pickled pineapple on the side. The staff were friendly and attentive and contributed to my positive dining experience."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Why isn't there one of these in every beach town? A casual place where the kids can play and you can have a well-made drink and excellent food! Plenty of vegan options. Line is long but food comes out quickly. College kids who work there are friendly. We plan every trip from LA to SB around eating lunch there! 

Go right when they open for zero line."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"We love this place and the food is amazing. However, the reservation staff is very unprofessional. While communicating with the reservation staff about a large group reservation they responded to my questioning email with an ""FYI"". They did this to explain the locations of our tables. Either way it was rude. No customer should be treated like this. The food here is amazing but if you are looking to make a reservation be prepared for a rude and slightly unhelpful staff."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Pretty good! I had the Baja fish tacos but they had a ton of options that looked really really good. I also had a pina colada and it was super tasty. The location is great too, right on the beach but they still have plenty of seating away from the sand and out of the sun. Family friendly but there is so much space that you could be away from kiddos if you really wanted."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Being vegan....and finding out that this place had vegan options, I was totally excited to get there. My first visit about a month ago I got the vegan chicken sandwich and I'd have to say that the portion size was a bit small for the price but overall the sandwich had some flavor. Just a few days ago I went back and had the hungry planet cheese burger... I was very disappointed. I've have this burger probably 20 times at natural cafe and wanted to give it a try here being that I was in town for the Bashore basketball classic at the high school. I honestly don't know if it was over cooked or the person who prepared it didn't add seasoning or what...it was a disaster to say the least. I will come back to try other things from the vegan menu but this one I won't for sure."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I love this place so much. I've been coming here since I was little and now I take my daughter here all the time. The food is ALWAYS good and fresh. They have an expansive menu so there's always going to be something new and interesting to try. They have vegetarian and vegan options which is awesome. 

My go to is always the fish and chips and they are truly the best fish and chips I've ever had. I've also had the vegan burger and it's delicious. I really didn't know what to expect but it was super flavorful and filling. 

My favorite part about this place is how kid friendly it is. I can bring my toddler and not worry about her being upset being locked in a high chair cause she can just run around and play while we are eating. The kids menu is great too! Always options for picky eater kiddos."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Long distance is really hard on my relationship with you. TBH I would sell my soul for a shrimp and avocado salad. The connection I have with you is something people wish for. Your mango smoothies and oreo milkshakes make me not depressed and thats saying a lot xoxo bae
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This was my first visit to Padaro Grill and attended a private small group gathering. First of all the setting is outstanding, on the beach and in a really nicely laid out area. Secondly, the staff were super - from our arrival and throughout the evening, literally catering to our needs. Finally, the food was much better than you'd expect in a beach setting. Five stars, definitely."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is a gem! Only discovered it during the pandemic so unfortunately have not been able to dine in yet. I have tried the fish tacos, shrimp avocado salad and their Beach Club sandwich. Everything super good and big portions! Will fill you up!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The food is awesome and the beach view is the best. You can't go wrong if you are in the area. The burgers are so fresh and Ice cream is perfect. We got a bacon burger and a root beer float.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a great find! The food is delicious (had the fish and chips, chicken Caesar salad, and a burger). The location is fantastic. You can sit and watch the waves and enjoy outdoor seating that is plentiful. Don't miss this place!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A few things I really appreciated about Padaro:

- They have an adults only patio 
- They have a really nice vegan menu that feels like they put care into :)

I visited PBG over Labor Day weekend as part of my first trip to Carpinteria. I loved it! We biked from the little downtown area and it was a lovely ride (and unlike LA or Long Beach, you don't have to worry about being run over every few minutes). I had the Vegan Chipotle Chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious. I do believe they use Gardein products for their vegan sandwiches. The fries, I was informed, are unfortunately fried together with meat products so I skipped those (I expected this, but nonetheless appreciate the honesty of the staff). Had my sandwich with a side salad (skip the croutons - they have cheese) instead along with a hard seltzer. Perfect, delicious and easy dinner. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Carpinteria!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Beautiful spot for families or a date...fast and friendly service was great they really have it down here. It could get busy but that means it's a good thing. It means that the spot is good!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love love love this hidden gem. 
They have an outdoor area and even high chairs that overlooks the ocean. 

There are train tracks and sometimes you can catch a train go by. It really is a special place to grab food and watch the sunset. 

You order your food as you walk in. Then they give you a buzzer and you pick up your food. Very simple and casual 

We had the tri tip sandwich, which was really good ! 
And also I tired the grilled fish tacos. They got a little soggy at the end so make sure to eat them right away 

Definitely will come back !"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Very nostalgic by the beach, family-friendly setting. Lovely outdoor seating. The food was very fresh and delicious. We had fish tacos and a salad. It was a very satisfying meal. They clearly put a lot of thought and effort into the quality of their ingredients."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome! Loved it!
Food was fresh and tasted great. There was a long line but it went by really fast. Outdoor dining is available and is great."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great place to take the kids. It's by the beach and great food. They sometimes have shows for the kids.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"NO PETS. NO PETS. NO PETS. NO PETS. 

There was a comment on this Yelp page that said pets ARE allowed. They are NOT. I planned our afternoon around coming here thinking that pets were allowed and then when I got here I was told that only service animals were allowed. I found out after my husband ordered so we were stuck. Had to eat in the car with the kids and the pets. Not a great experience. 

Food was fine. Service was fine. I just wish that I had known."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Best grilled chicken avocado sandwich and onion rings!! Outdoor sitting is a delight!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Food here was ok, and it's a nice scenic stop along the coast!  
Only downfall is that damn sand pit attracts all of the parents who don't want to watch their children.  The outside seating is in a beautiful grassy area with the damn sand pit right in the middle.  I have never seen such a sight in my life... two approximately 5-6 year old sisters having a serious sand fight!  Some of the few watchful parents hurried over to remove their kids from the chaos.  What I assumed to be the grandfather of these two spoiled brats came over to break it up, grabbing one of the girls by the arm trying to get her out of the sand.  She kicked, screamed and even punched grandpa until he let go and she continued ""playing"" in the sand.  The minute he walked away, there they went... at it again!  I wanted so badly to take video!  My friends and I could not believe our eyes!  It seemed as if everyone else around assumed this to be the ""norm"" around here too.  Finally, the mother came over to that damn sand pit and the two little devils suddenly became angels!
Oh, the children were everywhere around here.
Ok, enough about the kids... I had a tuna melt; the chese was hardly melted and the tuna salad was cold on grilled sourdough bread.  I always thought a tuna melt was hot??  Tasted ok though, just not what I expected.  The fries were good.  My husband had a burger that was a little too pink in the middle.  He said it was ok and ate it anyway, but he didn't really like it.
Padaro Beach Grill is for those with kids who want to ""off their children"" to the damn sand pit so they can enjoy time with their friends over lunch.  Not recommended for a quiet relaxing lunch on the beach with your date.  Choose wisely."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Beware the house salad that contains iceberg lettuce.  Nutritional value is lacking in iceberg, and when one bites into iceberg, water is released into one's mouth that tends to dilute the taste of the other ingredients.   About half of the lettuce in this salad is iceberg.  
They also forgot to put on the goat cheese."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Best place to go for burgers and beer along PCH. Stopped here with bae on our way up the coast to NorCal on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Got the black bean veggie burger and fries, bae got the pretzel burger with sweet potato fries, and we each got a beer. Hit the spot! Great place to go when the weather is nice, since they have a great outdoor lawn with picnic tables and a lovely view of the ocean."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great food and awesome staff. Great place to eat in the outside patio. Rode my bike 41 miles.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I love Padaro Beach Grill. Very happy to have this restaurant in Carp. The food is fine, the service is fine, but the real value here is the outdoor area for kids to play in a closed in safe place. The sand box is excellent, and the grass and trees make a fantastic place for games. 

I recommend taking kids, grabbing a pitcher of beer, and spending a couple hours socializing with friends.

For food, I like the grilled chicken sandwich, sub in the pretzel bun."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The Padaro Beach Grill is a fantastic location. From the tables you can look out and see the ocean, I feel the breeze, and really experience that goes. The hamburger was very tasty, although our meat was a little under done. The french fries were very bland and probably process potato product. All in all it's a great place to stop along the coast and get something to eat, and the environment is beautiful."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place and great atmosphere! Went here with my friend, her mom and sister. We love the outdoor garden and the beautiful day. Food was great. A good time had by all!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a wonderful lunch we had at Padaro Beach Grill.   We came at a week day and before 12:00 to score parking and a picnic table.   Food and service was top notch.    It felt like we were transported to Hawaii.  With Covid and not being able to travel to Hawaii this year, a trip to  Santa Barbara for lunch at Padaro's and surfing afterwards is the next best thing.... for now.  

I highly recommend coming to Padaro's on a weekday and before the lunch rush and before street parking fills up."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I usually order the shrimp and avo salad.  Always good.  But this last one was disappointing.  Hard unripe avocado on top and browning.  Shrimp inedible as it was chewy and rubbery.  I didn't eat it, afraid of getting sick.   It looked thrown together.  I frequent this place, but will stay away from the salads.   Bummer."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"BEAUTIFUL!! View, location and food! Feels like you are on vacation in Hawaii. Yes! Totally going back. I can't wait. This was my first time - will not be my last. I can't wait to take my husband on a nice drive up the coast, and stop here and surprise him. Best fish & chips we have ever had. Hands down! My teriyaki chicken sandwich was delish! Fries were legit! Such great food, beautiful scenery and nice music playing. Padaro's for the win!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Best beachside grill. Warning during covid order early so you dont have to wait around. Fav is the veggie burger but who doesn't love fried food on the beach. Lol
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great Management.  Padaro Beach Grill is a well oiled machine 
Get the Pretzel Bun Burger.  It will change your life for the better.  Your friends will notice a difference in you."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Always one of the best stops when visiting Carpinteria! The food is great fairly inexpensive and it's right on the beach! The only thing that could make this place better is if they served ice cream... lol.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place was great after a long drive this place definitely hit the spot . We got 805 and island beer , strawberry shake , the trio ( fries, sweet potato fries and super yummy onion rings . Padaro burger , country club and the tri tip sandwich. Will definitely come here again ."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Food is great. Really wish they'd lift their ban on dogs. We drove over an hour to check this place out because our friend recommended it. The food did not disappoint. We're used to taking our dog with us on road trips. We were told that we could leave our dog on the sidewalk by herself while we went in to eat. She's not a bike. She weighs 10 lbs. I would never leave her alone like that outside near a busy street. I guess I should have checked Yelp before coming.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We were on the highway one road trip & stopped here for lunch. Really nice to sit outside then burgers were good the area was really cute
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Passing through and found this stop for lunch. Everything we wanted, GREAT food, a beer and a VIEW!  Will be here for sure next time we are in the area!!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Was told this was a place to try. Came with the family. Onion ring are huge. Fish and chips and clam and chips were good. Kids chicken nuggets were pure chicken breast!  Clam chowder was good too. Only problem is there is no parking for RVs so come in a car. The eating area is very tropical
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food was amazing and views were even better. We went right before sunset and snagged an awesome table overlooking the water. We ordered a pina colada which was refreshing as heck. The trees, succulents, and ocean views definitely gave island vibes. We enjoyed the Padaro burger with onion rings which were the perfect crunch, fried fish tacos and a side salad. The fish tacos were amazing but the tortilla kept breaking. I would ask them to double wrap them or just eat the filling with the tortilla chips they provide on the side. After the sun set, they lit the fire in the pit behind us. There were plenty of outdoor picnic tables available and they were all spread out. Amazing! We will definitely be back next time we are in Carpinteria!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a great find. Great selection of food, clean bathrooms, tons of helpful staff serving and cleaning everywhere. The outdoor eating area was large, clean, and well spaced out for small groups or large. Definitely coming back. Great food, right next to the beach, what more could you ask for?"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We normally eat in at Padaro to enjoy the ambiance but that isn't an option nowadays, so we were happy to hear they were open for takeout and what better way to support the community during this pandemic than to continue to be a patron. When eating at Padaro, I always go for the delicious fish tacos. We switched it up, went for some vegan options (great vegan options by the way) - the vegan crab cake sandwich and vegan burger. We also chose a non-vegan appetizer, the quesadilla, which was incredible. The sandwiches hit the spot, you can also sub bread for a lettuce wrapped sandwich if you prefer. It's great to have an establishment that offers so many options and executes so well on them. If you haven't done so already, place an order online, grab your facemask, and enjoy some takeout from a Carpinteria staple. Thanks to the entire Padaro staff for being open and feeding the community with delicious food during these interesting times."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is worth checking out simply for the breath taking view. The location is literally unreal. We seriously watched the most beautiful sunset! They have plenty of heaters and a fire pit to help keep you warm after the sun sets. 

The food was good - typical burger joint type of food. I ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich lettuce wrapped and split and order of sweet potato fries. The sandwich was super yummy and flavorful, and I wasn't sad that I didn't have a bun. Overall I would say the food isn't spectacular but the location makes it worth it."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food was delicious, especially the calamari. But the real delight of the Padaro Beach Grill was the location and seating: a loose collection of outdoor seating, picnic tables and bar stools overlooking the beach, benches by a fire pit, and even tables in a secluded grotto. The view from the bar stools was lovely, even when the Surfliner passed and we could see all of the passengers. A perfect experience!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Got the vegan cheese burger & it was the most price-performant vegan burger I've ever had! Was also very impressed that they have a whole vegan menu.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is our go to spot whenever we drive north. Don't let the long lines deter you, considering the line was out the door today it went by fairly quick. The food came out fast too. Love the ambiance and the views. They've become dog friendly (certain area, unfortunately not near the beach views) which is a huge plus for us since we like to bring our pup with us. I forgot to take photos of my food (was too tired from our road trip!) I ordered the California burger, my boyfriend got the prime burger and we ordered the sweet potato fries and chili cheese fries to share. Burgers are nice and juicy and they don't skimp on the toppings. Didn't care for the sweet potato fries (the regular fries taste better) but the chili cheese fries were amazing!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Padaro's has been a favorite for quite some time. They have a menu that doesn't disappoint. Good appetizers, a solid variety of burgers and sandwiches, and some seafood options. Even a great variety of vegan options. Their margaritas are good, they have a variety of beers, and great outdoor seating. 

Hopefully they open up the sandbox again soon so the kids could entertain themselves. But still a fun time for all."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A wonderful, local gem with good eats and an idyllic location next to the ocean, it's a perfect stop off the 101 and a great little staycation when venturing from SB. The seating is primarily outdoors, spread out over spacious, grassy grounds with picnic tables and a kids sand area. It's a nice place for little ones to play while you chill, eat and have a beer. Order at the counter and the friendly and efficient staff will call your number for pickup when ready. Food is a mix of burgers, sandwiches, seafood, salads, mex, with good beers and a few mixed drink selections(!). Everything we've had is excellent: fish and chips, burgers and fries...most recently we had fried chips and clams and they were to die for. Great shakes and desserts too - you can't go wrong!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I always see this place from the 101 and actually went in to eat. Free parking along the side, totally covid compliant since all the dining is outside anyway. I was very impressed with the pricing, I would expect somewhere like this right on the coast to be inflated, but prices were great. I got a mahi mahi sandwich and side of tots and both were delicious!!

My only complaint is not all the tables have umbrellas so I ended up sitting in the direct sun since it was busy."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This is a fantastic family place. Perfect for enjoying a beer and watching the sunset while kids play. The food is good. The setting -- right at the beach -- is wonderful. What's not
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This spot is the absolute best. Let's start with parking.. okay. Not the greatest, but totally do able. You can park across the street, but watch the cars who fly by. Ok. That's out of the way. The building is nicely decorated, and the feel is the classic beach bar. The food is fairly priced, almost cheap. We were surprised that the prime burger was only $6.50. My boyfriend got the prime burger, and chili cheese fries. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Both were.... AMAZING. FRESH. FRESH. FRESH. We loved it so much we ALMOST ordered the shrimp tacos. Instead we got a root beer float and a cookies milkshake. They staff was fast and friendly. The food fresh. Ohh and the seating!!!! Also impeccable. So much room. You can choose to sit in the sun looking at the water, or at a picnic table with an umbrella. There's a train that runs by, just a beautiful sight. Stop here. It's awesome."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Yelpers didn't disappoint at all, this is a lovely beach grill. It was convenient for us because it was close to where we were staying for a few days to visit my husband's family. 
They are handling covid protocols great and the staff is really friendly and helpful. 
A little pricey compared to the portion sizes of items, but the food was good. We had the crab cake sandwich and grilled fish tacos. We loved their mango and piña colada smoothies."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place has the most amazing views and the food was delicious. The service was also exceptional! Definitely worth the drive from LA.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is my favorite place to come after surfing! It has outstanding food, especially their burgers. Their tater tots and french fries are really fantastic! Their shakes, especially the cookie shake, is the best shake in town! The atmosphere is also really awesome, and the outdoor area is very large and very fun. The food normally comes pretty quick, though sometimes on weekends it can be pretty busy. I'll be coming here for years!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely one of my favorite spots of all time in Santa Barbara County! If you like outdoors, family style, waterfront restaurants with tons of parking options and easy access to a 5-Star beach around the corner than you will love Padaro!

I have been coming here for years and years and enjoyed my experience every single time. From the root beer floats to the massive nachos and many burger options there's really no way to have a bad experience here, in my opinion. Their fish tacos and chopped cobb salad are also incredible choices. 

Besides the endless menu options that will blow your mind, Padaro has such a unique set up and beautiful environment. Located on one of my favorite beaches in the world (Santa Claus Beach) this restaurant is open to the skies, has grassy areas, sand pits for kids to play in, and picnic table style dinning. While it may sound strictly casual, there is also upper level seating with heaters (possibly a seasonal thing). 

Amazing place for family gatherings, date night, burgers, fries, milkshakes and sunsets, and so much more! Could not recommend this spot more and so excited to be hosting a family gathering here shortly. Pictures to come.."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Nice burgers, so many choices check the menu. Great Ahi Tuna fresh fish sandwich. Love it, my favorite.

Hungry Planet Burger -YES
Turkey Burger -YES
Veggie Burger -YES
Fire Roasted Chili Burger -Wow YES
+ sweet potato fries with ranch ;~) or a salad works well.

The BBQ'ed Tri-Tip ROCKS, it is loaded or as you like it, the big kids love it.

Wonderful playground areas for the munchkins. Full on Sandbox with all the toys to dig and get scruffy and sandy. The kiddos love this cool party down outdoor spot too. Plenty of kid friendly food choices on the menu. Great spot for kids parties, seems to be one going on often. The warm fire pit for cool winter evenings is chill.

Popular spot for the beach goers and the locals. Good variety of salads, veggie stuff includes a burger as above. We have been going here for years. Casual Beachy Bunch. CBB.

Fish and Chips - YES
Fish Tacos -YES x 2
Shrimp Tacos -YES all are yumster, delish!
Nice Taco Choices!

Nice beers on tap and from the bottles. Brewskies and Tacos, hello.

Ordering at the counter/register and yes you do ge a Red Blinky Light Coaster RBLC when your tray is ready for pickup.

Parking can be a tricky at times during the Summer months. This place gets real busy, the kids really like to party here. Nice picnic like benches and tables for that in the park feeling on the grass.

Get ready for the Pacific Surfliner Choo Choo as it barrels thru like a freight train on the tracks. The kids love it... enjoy."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place is AMAZING! Excellent  food for the whole family and wonderful atmosphere! A MUST go to when in Carpinteria!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This restaurant is owned by a gentleman who owns the  Habit and Hook Burger restaurants in nearby Oxnard. It's basically Hook on the beach! I give this little gem in Carpinteria 10 stars for their Covid operations on top of the 5/5 for food and beverage! 

The online pick up ordering was seamless. I was able to receive a text when my order was ready. I parked in front and was in and ready to enjoy my lunch in less than two minutes. It was so simple.

I highly recommend the tater tots, tuna melt and lime margarita! They are all very tasty and enough for lunch and dinner. The cost is about 10-15/per person.

There is a wonderful outdoor sitting that is not currently open. It has a kid's section with a pool and adult area for those wishing to drink responsibly and enjoy a meal and sunset. Truly, this is a wonderful seaside cafe!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Been here a couple times. You order at counter then pick up at pickup counter. No indoor seating. 

Good fish and chips and Great fish tacos. Kids burgers and fries were delish. Patties seasoned well and not overcooked. Had the jalapeño bloody Mary, was pretty good. 

It was pretty busy and the Line was long on Sunday afternoon.  Took about 30 min. to wait in line and get food.  We sat next to the building under the patio this time because there were no people nearby there, but announce speakers for order number pickups were super loud, so that was less than ideal.  

Last time, pre-COVID, we sat in the Outside eating area which is spacious with grass, kids can run around, and it has a wooden bar that you can sit at that looks out to the ocean which is great."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What's a surprising treat. We were road-tripping and wanted to grab some fresh affordable fish and ended up at Padrino's. Their fresh fish was perfectly matched by the ambiance as you could sit outside close to the ocean. Casual, good quality, and beautiful! Highly recommend!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Food is exactly as claimed.  Consistent good value. Limited hours of availability and less competitive take out service drop it down a level.   Potential is there- we want more hours and we want more options to access.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is amazing! 
Great for the whole family and food was delicious .
Perfect for Outside dining and they follow all Covid requirements. Highly recommended"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wonderful respite, beautiful location, relaxing fun music and the best juicy burgers! Will definitely be back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,It was good.  We had the grilled fish tacos.  Wasn't what we were looking for but was recommended by the hotel staff.  Probably won't try it again.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Ordered a burger and fish tacos. Both were very delicious. Came here because of the pictures of the view. The hedges were too high to even get a glimpse of the ocean. Also, when I walked in... I was immediately given the evil eye from a Karen waiting to go to the bathroom. As I sat down, there was a Kevin cussing up a storm with a group of young guys outside. Like he was seriously trying to fit in but doing a very terrible job. Not too familiar with the area but seems like this may be a city filled with Kevins and Karens?"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food here is really good. I had beach club which was really nicely constructed (I'm weird about structural integrity in sandwiches) and tasty; a little bit of everything in each bite, as it should be. Wife had fish tacos which were also very good; I had a bite and the fish was fried really well. Prices are really reasonable and picnic tables outside are awesome. Good spacing between tables and efficient system for calling out orders. This was our first time here but I got the impression that COVID hasn't impacted their operations too much. Another worthwhile stop in Carpinteria."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Had a blast at this place!! The kids loved playing in the sandy area-they even had buckets and shovels! The food was delicious. We ordered the fish tacos and the kids hamburger, and it was all so good! The line for food was long, but that's only because it's so nice there that loads of people come to enjoy. Had no trouble finding a nice table big enough for our group of 10. Also, I ordered a glass of Cabernet, but it turned out they had run out. They gave me a glass of Shiraz instead and told me to come back for a free refill since they had run out of the Cabernet. The person that took our order was great, and so was the server who brought out our food. This restaurant is busy for a reason! Great good, fun for everyone, gorgeous location, and most importantly, GREAT SERVICE:). Great service is what makes a place wonderful, and they've got it here!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We were driving back to the inland empire from a weekend at Morro Bay. We were looking for a place to stop and get something to eat and I came across this place. Did not realize it's on the beach, parking was crazy that we were very lucky to find something quick. There was a pretty large line waiting 2 get in but it moved pretty fast. I was afraid we weren't going to find seating since they were very busy. I ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered a burger. He said it was very good and so was mine would definitely stop again the little park like setting was very cute"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Super fun!!! Prices are great and the atmosphere is super chill. Prefect for a date or for the family. Would go there again.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We came for fish tacos and ocean view picnic style dining on a perfectly flawless 70 degree day.  

Off the beaten path with a surfer dude kind of feel to it, we ate our fill for 5 for under $50 bucks.  A delicious bargain and a welcome change from some of the more touristy waterfront joints in Santa Barbara.

Worth a quick jaunt down the 101 from SB ..."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We have been visiting Carpinteria every summer for the past 10 years, but had never visited. Hands down this is the best place to eat at with kids, just bring a beach blanket and enjoy the food and sights.  There are plenty of tasty food options to choose from  and they make a mean grilled cheese.  Our toddler loved that she could run around, play in the sand or chase the birds."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place was overall a great find! This was my first time in the area and I am a strict yelp follower and i was doing my research when I stumbled upon this place. The setting was beautiful, there was mud but due to previous rain yesterday so that wasn't their fault. The prices are great and we had choices even for the vegans in the group!! Will definitely come back when I'm in the area! The only thing I would change is that not enough of the tables had umbrellas to block out the sun!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place was so cute! They had a lovely lawn to relax on while you nosh on a delicious burger or salad, of course washed down with a shake. We were able to watch the sun set over the ocean from here. We didn't get to see the live music, but it seems like a really cute setting for it! And the service was very friendly."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Came here for lunch during our Santa Barbara day-trip, we arrived around their opening time and there was already a bunch of people waiting to order, so they're definitely a local favorite.

The restaurant is very spacious and there is plenty of outdoor seating, so it was very easy to social distance while we waited for the food to come out. 

I got the Fish & Chips and thought it was about average. It was a decent meal for lunch, but wasn't anything impressive. Overall, a decent spot for lunch by the beach."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,So glad we found this place through yelp!!! One of the best Fish and chips I've ever tasted.  Perfect place to eat and enjoy with family and friends. Sorry no pictures...it was gone the moment we got it!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Best place around to take young kids! They can run free and safely. The train coming by is always a high point for them. There is an elevated patio if adults want to be away from the children, but the sand box for the youngest kids is a special attraction. The food is good and prices are moderate. Waiting in line can be a chore during the season, but the cool shade and fun for the kids is worth the wait."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This my favorite restaurant in CA, fantastic location literally right on the beach, amazing food, friendly staff, nice beer selection, and fair prices. I regularly come here with my Fiancé to dinner and walk down the street onto the beach and relax as the sun sets. Great restaurant."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Delicious food, great place to hang out... the view is amazing. The shrimp tacos were extremely tasteful"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Tacos, great. Service GREAT! Onion rings, amaaahhhhzing, the music tho, WHY? Country rock needs to be removed from Padaro's playlist. it ruins the vibe and is honestly confusing."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wow I wish we could have eaten at this restaurant but we just ordered takeout because of COVID. My husband and I are visiting in town and decided to check out this place. 

PADARO BURGER [5 stars] *****
I ordered the Padaro Burger which had crunchy bacon, avocado and this insanely massive/good onion ring on it, and the chipotle sauce was sooo delicious. I should have ordered a side of the onion rings they were that amazing and had the perfect crunch to them. I asked for the bbq sauce on the side and I really got to taste that chipotle. But wow this burger was one of the best burgers I've had, sooo juicy! 

GRILLED TACOS [3 stars] ***
My husband got the grilled tacos, he think the Baja fried fish would have been better. Chips were good too! But they didn't give any salsa for it so we didn't really enjoy all the chips plain. 

CALAMARI [3.5 stars] ****
Lastly we got a side of calamari. They were HUGE. My biggest warning is if you're ordering this to go, they will not stay crunchy. By the time we opened them, and we just parked down the street to eat the overlooking the beach in our cars, they were soggy. But I can tell they WOULD be amazing if eaten fresh & crunchy as expected to be served. It's paired with this white tartar sauce which was actually really good too, normally I'm hesitant to tartar but this was flavored well. Thanks Padaro for the great food & experience! Definitely give these guys a try if you're in the area."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped by to pick some food up for the beach. Food was great, we got fish and shrimp tacos. Fish was good, but shrimp stood out as the best. The back area looked very nice as well, it's right next to the beach, so great views everywhere."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Much better food this visit!  Dear Hubby chose the Maui burger, and I had the turkey burger. Both were prepared to the perfect state of doneness.  I would order the turkey burger again, but ask for the thousand island on the side, as it got a bit much.

Also, I was disappointed to learn that grilled mushrooms aren't an option as an add-on.  Bit of deduction in satisfaction for that.    Overall, it was nice to return to this tropical-themed seaside venue.  It's definitely family friendly, and welcoming to all ages.

Music in the garden varies between reggae, country, vintage pop, and other options that are uplifting / add to the relaxed vibe.  The tables are naturally spread out, very safe in these lingering COVID times.

The staff keeps the freshly prepared food coming with a friendly attitude.  Free parking!

We came around 3:15 on a Saturday afternoon and walked right up to the ordering counter.  Now to head to Linden Ave. to walk off our meal!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food is pretty good, but what I love about this place is the atmosphere! It's mostly outdoor seating. Kind of has a tropical/beach sort of vibe. Prices are pretty affordable. The drive is nice. I plan on bringing my family here sometime!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I love this place. It's my go to for lunch. The atmosphere is amazing. The view is amazing. Go for the Chile burger (I forget what it's called). Sooo good. There is even a little sandbox type playground and a bridge and tables outside have beautiful views
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome place! Good prices, great food, and I really cool big outdoor space right by the beach. Everyone needs to check Padaro Grill out!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food, great atmosphere. I definitely recommend this place to anyone in town or out of town."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Sprawling restaurant with lots of outdoor seating. Has lots of vegetarian options. It is an order at the counter and pick up yourself place. The service was fast. I ordered the black bean veggie burger with fries. The patty was very tasty and the burger was super filling. It had a great chipotle aioli on it as well. 

There's a sandbox for kids to play in which looked fun. Parking was also very easy. Good casual place to grab a bite."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is the perfect spot to be at the beach and eat with your kids! Second place we've been since restaurants opened. And felt very comfortable since it's all outside and the tables are so far from each other. Sand was still out for the kids to play in but no toys. It's also on a train track so the kids can see the train go by while you eat. 

Fish tacos are great and their shrimp salad. Chips are also yummy and salsa is very fresh and tasty. Kids meals are large and you get a choice of fries or apple sauce and a drink - milk, juice or soda which is nice. They offer good beer and wine so it's nice to get a drink and sit in the nice weather. 

Parking is sometimes a mess because people are going to the beach as well but it usually just takes a few minutes to find something but you may have to walk a little bit. 

We stop by on our way home from the zoo every time and it's always a great experience!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"After we wrote our original review, the owner of the restaurant contacted us immediately. He told us it is not their policy to charge a service fee, and he was going to make sure this didn't happen to other guests. He took care of us, and we really appreciate owners who take pride in their business. We are now satisfied customers."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wow, I am so impressed with this place. The Mr. discovered it a few weeks ago when he was working in the area and found it via Yelp. He told me that he had one of the best vegan cheeseburgers he's ever eaten. 
Fast forward to a couple of nights ago we decided to make the drive out and go for dinner. Sure enough, I ordered the vegan cheeseburger as did he. We also got tater tot's, fries, and I got the vegan ice cream sandwich. 
The vegan cheese burger was so good! I agree with the Mr. in that this is definitely one of the best tasting the vegan cheese burgers I have ever had. The patty was thick and so flavorful, the caramelized onions were smoky and perfect. The bun held together well and was mild enough in flavor so as not to take away from the yummy taste of the burger itself. 
Also, this place is decorated and laid out so cool! There's an area for kids and dogs, as well as an adults only area. We chose to sit in the adults only area, which I really appreciated that there weren't little children running around. I love kids, but I don't always enjoy dining in the presence of them. 
This is right on the beach so you've got a beautiful view. There are plenty of picnic tables and even a nice big fire pit you can sit by. 
They have a regular menu and then a vegan menu. I'm looking forward to going back, I already have my eyes on the nachos for next time !"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"padaro was such a great experience! ever since covid, we've been feeling anxiety about eating at restaurants but they had a huge amount of very spread out outdoor seating, lots of 6 feet apart markers on the ground, and everyone was wearing masks. the ambiance outside was so gorgeous, they had tons of string lights and being so close to the beach was perfection. 

their menu was super expansive, and there were lots of great vegan options as well as local beers. the fish tacos were so fresh and tasty, and the veggie burger was so satisfying and huge. i would definitely recommend coming here!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"One of my new favorite restaurants! Such a beautiful breathtaking view and a breathtaking menu too! So much to choose from, there is no way to go wrong . They even have a completely vegan menu which had a really delicious vegan chicken chipotle sandwich! I'm not even vegan and I enjoyed it highly. Their margaritas are super yummy with the perfect sweetness. They even have a sand pit filled with lots of toys to keep the littles occupied. For once I was able to sit down and enjoy my meal while my two kids played in the sandpit . Their Baja fish tacos are up their amongst my faves , also the Padaro burger YUM!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food is great. Ambiance is amazing. Wonderful place to eat and has something to please everyone. Good burgers and seafood, good shakes for sweet tooths, vegan and gluten free options too. 
Seating area has lots of benches spread out over a large outdoor eating area that feels more like a park than a restaurant. Dog area near the front for those with pets. Large sand area with toys for kids. Plenty of space so everyone can have their own little area eating to the sound of waves and fresh salt air of the beach. Good place to see the sunset too.

If eating in the evening, bring hat and/or sunglasses since the sun will probably be setting and might get in your eyes otherwise. Also might want to bring a sweater, as the sea breeze can get chilly."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Very tasty food. Near perfection. Very large portions so arrive hungry. Parking is pretty easy. Not too Long of a wait for  the food.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"one of my favorite places to have lunch/dinner. patio is beautiful, amazing ocean views & kid friendly. highly recommend the beach club or shrimp tacos!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I loved the burgers here, very good, cheap and service was excellent.   I loved also the beach lawn area for eating, very cool.  Highly recommended.  Not fancy, but perfect."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We had such a great time here for lunch today! Beautiful view, gorgeous weather and delicious food. Staff is very friendly and efficient. Plenty of sanitizing protocols in place, 6 foot distancing, masks required, etc. Tables are spread  out and grounds are immaculate. Plenty of shady spots and tables with umbrellas as well. The burger was well cooked, flavorful and had plenty of toppings. The onion rings were so crispy!! Definitely making a trip back. Parking in the center is 90 minutes (free) and spots opened up pretty frequently."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is a must eat!  Walk up counter, outdoor seating, picnic style, with a sand pit for the kids.  Great burgers!  Had the hickory burger, great choice.  Fish tacos are also great!  We look forward to eating here every summer when we are in the area!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Highly recommend eating outside on the grass to take advantage of the beautiful view. Every single person ordered something different and we're obsessed. They also offer a giant vegetarian menu which is very cool not for me but great to see the variety of food they can offer for those who are
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is just simple, trust the high ratings.

You just can't beat their quality of food, the taste and the lovely location. Shout out to the employees,  they were nice and belted out the food fast.

So much to choose from, even you silly picky eaters will find something here that you will come back for!

Who needs Hawaii when this place exsists! Blows Maui out of the ocean."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food and location.  Awesome for families, kids, adults, everyone.  No rushing.  Will definitely be back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Good food but the staff needs to be more aware of kids who are running around and not being supervised by parents. There are signs that say not to go into the plants and pods yet kids are still running in and out of that area and ruining the greenery. There is also an elevated area that had an ""adults only"" sign yet entitled, clearly INTOXICATED parents had there small children (5 and under) running around this area and were not paying any attention to them. One of kids was dragging the metal adults only sign around asking her mom to open it, her mom didn't even look at her but said ""ok"" and a staff member came and got the sign from the child but said nothing to the parents. One of their other ignored kids was rocking in their chair and almost fell off the ledge. If parents can't take care of their own kids the staff should be on top of drunk parents and remind them of the rules. Not an enjoyable experience"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Second time eating here and the good was great!! The ambiance can't be beat...sun, blue sky, outdoors, social distancing! Stopped here for lunch on way to Santa Barbara. They were busy but kind moved quickly and plenty of tables! Best place to eat during pandemic...every table is at least 6' apart and all are outdoors!! The California Burger was so good and fresh...scoop of avocado, grilled onions, red peppers and fresh lettuce and tomatoes. Burger cooked to perfection!! Onion rings were amazing...crispy on outside and tender on inside!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"If you have not had decent fish tacos in a while or ever- this is where you go. The most juicy, lightly battered, melt in your mouth red snapper. The fish is something that I have been needing my mouth to taste for months!!! Fried fish can be done wrong and ruin it. This place is wonderful!  Views of the ocean, ocean air, birds chirping nearby and social distancing while enjoying being outside. Parking can be rough but circle a couple times if you're devoted and you won't be disappointed."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love this place! Every item on the menu is fresh and prepared excellently.
Great place for kids of all ages too. Service is good also!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"The view is amazing. Sitting by the fire taking pictures are most customers do. Food was average but try their shake, was nicer."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"We were in the area and went based off a recommendation. The food was good but did not live up to the hype. I expected more from this place. Cute ambiance and great out door seating. Our food came out quickly. I liked the spicy green beans. The vegan burger was ok but we were told it was not vegan because of the mayo & other sauces in it. Pretzel burger was ok. Chicken sourdough burger was good. We also had the trio fries, onion rings, & sweet potato fries. Overpriced, would not return. OXOXO"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Always a must anytime we're driving that direction. Great food. Great atmosphere! The sandbox will keep the kiddos busy until your food arrives!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I am no Picasso, but...

Let me paint you a picture of how I spent my Saturday afternoon in beautiful Carpinteria, California. 

It all started when my 2 year old said, ""Daddy, I wanna go the beach!"" 

So off we went to pack the car with all of the beach essentials...

Towels, sand buckets, hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, change of clothes, water, snacks...

Basically...

Everything, but the kitchen sink. 

-------------------------------------------------

I've come to Carpinteria several times over the years and I've always parked alongside the beach on Santa Claus Lane. Of course Padaro Beach Grill has been there for as long as I can remember, but to be honest I've only actually eaten here a couple of times and it has been many years since I had. 

As we hit the road and we encountered a bit of traffic going through Camarillo, I could tell my wife was getting a bit hangry and even asked ""Is this place even that good?"" And the classic, ""How much longer until we get there?""

Knowing that it was a solid 50 minutes out with traffic, I told her ""oh it's about 40 minutes"" and just pressed a little harder on the accelerator once we started moving again.  ;) 

Upon our arrival, we lucked out and found a parking spot almost right away. The parking here is hit or miss and sometimes you just might not find a spot alongside Santa Claus Ln. and trust me it happens more often than not. 

As we walked up to PBG, the line was about 15 groups deep, but the line was moving and our stomachs were not about to cooperate if we decided to go elsewhere. 

As we inched closer and closer to the front of the line, we started smiling knowing that we were almost next to order. 

As it was busy, my wife took the kids and found a nice outdoor table with some good shade. 

Within about 10-15 minutes of ordering, I heard the Magic Words over the loudspeaker, ""Number 06, your order is Ready!!"" 

As I walked up to the pick-up counter, I couldn't help but let out a sigh of HELL YESSSSS (in my head of course).The food looked SOOOOOO AMAZING, I literally couldn't wait to get back to the table to share the feast we were about to devour. 

Here's what we had: 

Pretzel burger with bbq sauce, bourbon caramelized onion, chipotle Mayo and American cheese. (The pretzel bun glistened and is life changing good!)

Tuna melt on grilled sourdough (it was as delicious as it was beautiful) 

Kids cheeseburger with fries (closest burger to in n out I've ever had) 

Onions and tater tots were cooked perfectly! 

A sprite and a Margarita to share, it was just what we needed to quench our thirst before heading over to the beach after we ate. 

The great service, the friendly staff, the delicious food and the spacious outdoor seating area at Padaro Beach Grill is everything you would expect for a beautiful day in Santa Barbara County, and trust me, it was a beautiful day indeed. 

As more and more people get vaccinated, life seems to be slowly returning back to the normal we once knew. Everyone wore masks and were respectful of each other's space. As I looked around while we ate, I couldn't help but smile knowing that we as humans, are doing what we do best...

Persevering through difficult times, hopefully a little kinder this time around. 

Thank you Padaro Beach Grill for allowing me to have a memorable outing with my family, we will 100% be back to support your business."

1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Good American food options with a nice quiet place to sit by the ocean. We've  had the burgers, sandwiches, and tacos. All good tasting but nothing that separates them from other good places."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Food is always decent for being a beach grill and casual place. My kids have fun playing in the sandpit. We've been here many times and always leave happy.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Nice burgers, so many choices check the menu. Great Ahi Tuna fresh fish sandwich. Love it. 

Hungry Planet Burger -YES
Turkey Burger -YES
Veggie Burger -YES
Fire Roasted Chili Burger -Wow YES

The BBQ'ed Tri-Tip ROCKS, it is loaded or as you like it.

Wonderful playground areas for the munchkins. Full on Sandbox with all the toys to dig and get scruffy and sandy. They love this cool party down spot too. Plenty of children friendly food choices on the menu. Great spot for kids parties.

Popular spot for the beach goers and the locals. Good variety of salads, veggie stuff includes a burger. We have been going here for years.

Fish and Chips - YES
Fish Tacos -YES x 2
Shrimp Tacos -YES all are yumster, delish!
Nice Taco Choices!

Good beers on tap and from the bottles.

Parking can be a tricky at times during the Summer months. This place gets real busy, the kids really like to party here. Nice picnic like benches and tables for that in the park feeling. 

Get ready for the Pacific Surfliner Choo Choo as it barrels thru like a freight train. The kids love it... enjoy. 8~)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I read that this place is affiliated with the Hook, which is awesome!

When we went, they let us place our order, sit down and wait for several minutes before informing us that they were out of 1/2 of the food we ordered due to late shipment. We canceled the order and had to go elsewhere."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great casual place for families with little kids. I'd give three stars for food, four for overall vibe/service. This is a quintessential Santa Barbara, low-key place for food. It's a perfect place to walk off Santa Claus beach and head into - no need to dust the sand off. Stick with burgers. The fish tacos are ok but kind of bland. Affordable. The grilled cheese for kids is a very generous portion - could easily be split across two small children."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Be wary of the grilled fish taco.  My fiance ordered the grilled fish sandwich taco the evening of Nov. 18.  He says he doubts it was snapper as noted on the menu board but rather cod.  I noted a fishy smell when he got his order but I did not say anything because I didn't want him to think I was fussy.  But, unfortunately, I sure wish I had.  This morning, he is sick as a dog, vomiting all night through this morning.  He had to cancel his appointments with clients because he can't function beyond vomiting in the toilet.  I feel so bad for him.  I'm sure it was the fish taco because he's had nothing else to eat since then.  Otherwise, I've always enjoyed this establishment.  I've been coming here with my grandchildren for more than four years.  This is the first incident we've had with the food."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Super Delicious food! And we had an amazing view of the beach to boot! There's a huge back patio like area for sitting and then a deck as well, 
 which gave us the great view. Definitely a great place to go with friends for a nice meal during the day."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Pulled over on the side of the road to get gas and decided we were hungry and yelp to find this place and it was fantastic. The people were great and explaining any questions wonderful to sit outside to look at the ocean and the food was delicious. You will definitely leave there with a smile on your face and a full belly.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"It was fairly busy, when we arrived. Rather than waiting in line, we opted to tacos a la carte and beer. We ordered fish, shrimp and carne asada--all excellent! Plus the added bonus that we did not have to wait in line! Our girls found a prime seating spot with an ocean view while I train breezed by. This is a Nice stop with the family for lunch on the way to our hotel."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great place to stop and have a quick bite to eat. I had shrimp tacos and my husband had the bbq tri tip sand which it was good for the price .. convenient parking and the beautiful park like setting was nice to sit and have lunch  ..
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Great set up but seems ridiculous to have a no dog policy for an all outdoor restaurant
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I'm writing this review on behalf of my sister and nephew, they had lunch here today, and my sister was pushing my handicapped 8 year old nephew in his specialized stroller, he cannot walk, and the owner or manager came up and asked if he was my sisters son, and handed her a hat for him to have. He very enthusiastically said 'give him this!'. The warm, and welcoming demeanor of this employee made my nephews day! He loves meeting strangers, and especially loves it when they interact with him, as few do. Thank you for your kind generosity!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Went there for lunch... best oceanview outdoor seats... very reasonable price for the million dollar view!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Burger was amazing!! I love the food, service and the beach vibe!! Their milkshakes are delicious!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Awesome kid friendly place! Perfect for an informal lunch next to the beach with a sandbox for kids to play!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I would fly back across the country just to eat their Cobb salad (with cheddar not blue) again.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome! The greatest fear as a parent of a small child in a restaurant is that the kid will get too antsy and you will have to leave before ordering and eat from a drive thru, or leave the meal half finished as you pay the bill with a squirmy kid in one hand and half a sandwich in the other. Here, they have a sand box that the children love to play in, and picnic tables nearby so you can sit and watch. If your cute but hell raising darling finishes eating before you do, just let them go back and play while you keep one eye on them and one eye on your burger. As a bonus, there's a train track right over the fence, and what kid doesn't love trains?! And the final icing on the cake... The food is good too. We live too far away to go here frequently, but it will be on our minds any time we're up that way in the future.

Oh yeah, and don't shy away from this place if you're not too fond of children. There's a designated adult seating area for you too!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A gem right on the beach. Normally there are plenty of tables and a small grassy area to eat but they're only doing takeout right now. Tri-tip fries were hot and crispy! Steak had just the right seasoning and was very tender. 

Kids loved the chicken nuggets. Perfect portion for them. Burger was juicy, covered in fresh veggies sandwiched between a soft brioche bun. They have the best tuna melt, hands down. 

Large portions for a great price. Tap and pay, easy parking, safety procedures in place, clean customer bathrooms. Different size drinks would be a plus. Overall, we'll be back! Hard to get pics when you devour the food without thinking! Give 'em a shot!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"First off- let me begin with how ridiculously beautiful the area is! And to make it even more fantastic, they have an area with a fire pit where you can watch the ocean - THAT IS OFF LIMITS TO KIDS!!!!! OMG!!! Peace and serenity! Or- uninterrupted grown up time! Heheheh.
Now to the food..I had the turkey burger, which was super juicy and flavorful. We shared an order of fries which were a lot and tasty as well. The prices are super decent, and they have bomb fish tacos which are super fresh and seasoned to perfection. If and when I go back, this is a definite pit stop! There is a variety of shops you can peruse just in case you have the shopping bug.  Must go!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Very efficient service. Food is really good. Plenty outdoor bench seating. We saw someone cleaning the common areas twice while standing in line.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Such a cool and relaxing hidden little spot! The boyf and I randomly decided to check this place out and it has become our favorite getaway gem. So far we've tried their burgers, fish tacos, calamari, onion rings, micheladas and their margaritas. The food is surprisingly delicious and their outdoor seating area is the best part. Its not crowded and the beach is steps away. Love this place!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"It's a thousand times better than any rest stop food and definitely delivers when it comes to tasty fast food. 
The burger was pretty big and it was hard finishing all that food. The meat was cooked to almost a medium well. The tater tots come in a fairly small container for the price. The beach can be viewed if you're standing up and there is a small platform in the back that's ""adults only."" However I can't imagine too many people use it since this is usually a rest stop, or an in between to the next destination.  Great pit stop when there are no other local options."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food, great price. Huge beautiful outdoor area right by the beach. Basically everything here is delicious."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"One of our favorite places in between home and Santa Barbara.  Love the setting, the menu is great casual beach fare, and prices are fair.  Our visit yesterday was half disappointing, though.

Dear Hubby had an island blonde lager on draft that tasted harsh like the cheap beer we used to drink in college.  Not a winner.

His teriyaki burger was delicious, and I was grateful to be able to sample a few bites of the sweet/tangy flavors.  We had also ordered a side Caesar salad and chili nachos to share.

Thumbs up on the simple Caesar, dressed up with some fresh cherry tomatoes, croutons, and grated Parmesan.  I'd order it again as a counterpoint to heavier fare.

Unfortunately, though we've had stellar nachos here before, yesterday's version looked and tasted largely pre-made, with only the guacamole, sour cream, and salsa added before serving.  Beans were dried out, and cheese already starting to harden.

On the plus side, the staff was friendly and helpful, and we snagged a spot reminiscent of a tropical get-away, under lush greenery.

We'll be back, but will probably not order nachos."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"love it. tons of vegan options which is always great for me. we took the food to go (covid, ya know) but i believe you can also get it delivered"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Kids! Giant sandbox! Sunset! Fish tacos! Onion rings! Umbrellas! It's like a vacation in restaurant form. 

We loved the atmosphere and super friendly service. The burgers were only OK, but the setting and mood more than made up for it. I'd go for anything seafood. Linger a while and watch the sun go down."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Always in a great mood while/after eating here. Feels like Hawaii with the outdoor patio type area with flowers and palm trees.  California burger is great, all the burgers are great actually.  Delicious sweet potato fries."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great place to stop by on the way back to LA. Food is great and the backyard is perfect for young kids to run around while parents enjoy their food.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Stopped in for dinner for us and always it was good I saw a few new items listed but I usually end up with a burger extra patty of course or fish n chips my mother in law likes the fish n chips also eventually when we eat there again we tend to take out I'll purchase a brew of some sort lol
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,New owners have ruined what used to be a great local spot. The burgers are now just frozen patties heated up on a grill. Their fries are flavorless. On top of that it's more expensive than it used to be.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"A nice place next to the beach. Enjoyed lunch under palm trees at a picnic table with an umbrella. Some shade, some sun. Everyone was happy. 

Yummy Baja tacos with light and crispy chips; appetizer: generous scoop of guacamole with chips; kids were extremely satisfied with their grilled cheese with fries and soda. Didn't cost an arm & a leg. 

Friendly staff. Cute bunny in the grass."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Country club sandwich was the best. I am typically a burger guy, but lately I've been curious about the chicken sandwiches at different restaurants. This one did not disappoint- it was so good. I only wish it were trove the size! The chicken was crispy and so was the bacon... the creamy avocado just adds to the wonderful taste. I have a couple fave chicken sandwich joints and this is one of them... now :)

The outdoor setting is so nice as well- plenary of seating with umbrellas. Parking in the front is scarce at peak hours, but there's plenty of parking on the street.

Thanks for the great food!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Just awesome! We came about 30 minutes before closing on Friday, and it was very slow. The fish and chip and the Baja fish tacos were on point. The views were gorgeous and ugh lots of little bunnies running around the property!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food is done very nice, basically a gourmet burger place. The fresh buns are amazing. My only complaint is its a bit pricy and the wine is poured in pimpy little plastic cups. Great for groups and kids. There is a nice adults area with a fire pit if you want to escape the crazy kids."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely beautiful location paired with delicious food and great service! We had my bacholerette lunch here over the weekend and the owner was nice enough to accommodate our large party. The grounds here is absolutely stunning and so much fun for the whole family. There was a huge variety a food featuring both vegan and vegetarian options as well. I had the fish and chips and a few glasses of wine and was extremely satisfied with the fresh ingredients. Everyone enjoyed the good and the exoerience. This the nicest beach grille ive ever been too, and I have seen quite a bit. Thank you for the incredible experience and awesome memories!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The view is fascinating specially at sunset , 
The mango margarita was great as well ,
I had a shrimp & avocado salad ( it was below average ) ,
The California burger was good , not the best that I had  but I'll definitely try it  again . We also ordered fries with chili , the fries didn't taste very fresh but the chilli was great, the service was good 
Its a very chill place that you can go with few or many company and you will still enjoy it . Prices was ok ,They also have area for adults only , for less distraction and more enjoyable ambiance.
I am definitely coming here again"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This is a great place to come sandbox for the kids good food reasonable prices the only thing is we need more umbrellas for Sun.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a great find. Fast service and the food was delicious. The Baja Fish Tacos was delicious and deep fried to perfection. I was full after the first one but had to eat it all, so yummy. Definitely a place to stop and eat at. Can't go wrong."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This is a cool spot. I had the special of the day Padara Burger. The only thing I would change about this burger is switch out the lettuce for coleslaw. I also had the calamari which was very good. I only ordered the calamari because I am not a fan of stringy french fries. I will definitely be coming back here!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place is outstanding for families with young children.  There are picnic tables throughout a nice lawn and a sand box with toys for the kids.  There are shady spots and spots in the sun Considering the excellent location and setup, the food was surprisingly good.  I expected the food to be far inferior to what it was.  Great choices on the kid menu.  And they have beer and wine!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"An overall great experience! 
I want to give a shout out to Padaro Beach Grill for creating such a laid back and relaxing environment. 

Parking can be a little nuts, so plan for that. Sometimes the wait to order your food can also take awhile, but the food and atmosphere ARE SO WORTH THE WAIT and it gives you time to pick out the perfect place to  sit. The wait for the bathroom is usually a bit, so do your best to also plan ahead.

As soon as you place your order and then you step out into the lawn, you take a deep breathe and then just enjoy the smell of ocean air and the view. Your kids are free to play in the sand and what's so great is it's a semi controlled environment.

I have tried several items off the menu but some of my favorites are the bbq chicken salad, Hawaiian burger, the teriyaki chicken sandwich or the veggie burger.

The staff here are friendly!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,The food was so bland and boring it was crazy. The only good thing was the tater tots. I got the shrimp tacos and my husband got the pineapple teriyaki burger with tater tots. The chips and salsa weren't even good it was amazing I don't know how you go wrong with that. We paid nearly $40 for our two meals Plus a drink and fries for my daughter. There was a pretty garden seating area outside but it was really packed which made us feel uncomfortable during covid times so we sat in the boring patio. There are 50 million signs in this joint telling you what to do and what not to do which I found really off-putting. It's like we are children. We absolutely will not be back.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This place has great food and sides. The prices are good too! I came here with my brother and mom for the first time, and we all loved our food. We got the Prime Burger, Pretzel Berger, and the Baja Fish tacos. The tater tots were amazing, and the meals were overall great. Definitely some really good burgers, and good tacos too. The bathroom had a small line, but it went relatively quickly. Definitely a great place for kids, and tons of space for them to play. There is an adult only area around a fire pit though, if you would rather not be near the kids."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My friend and I love seafood ! We love fish tacos, especially when you are near the beach ! When I saw my food. I was like that looks good . But no it was Delicious! Wish the tortilla was heated just a bit more but regardless it was good! Also had a side of Calamari that didn't even lasted for the picture haha ! One taco is even gone because I got two and honestly should have got more! 
Next time I go ! I'm ordering 4 and not 2! Thank you for the delicious meal !!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I would have liked to give Padaro Beach Grill at least a three star review, but I have to go with one star due to the fact that I contracted food poisoning from the fish sandwich.

To preface, I know that I contracted food poisoning from the restaurant as all the meals I had the day I went were shared with other people and they did not get sick. The only meal I had where I ate something different from my family members was here.

I would advise the staff/owners to thoroughly inspect their fish preparation method as it is very concerning.

Other than the food poisoning, I thought that the sandwich was pretty good! The bun was nicely toasted and it had a good amount of tartar sauce. The fish was the big issue as it was likely contaminated but I was unable to tell due to the fact that the tartar sauce and lemon juice probably masked any weird flavors.

The view of the ocean is also quite fantastic and makes this restaurant really enjoyable to eat at during sunset or sunny days in general! 

I don't think I will be coming back here as I personally didn't find it worth the 40 minute drive from my house and because I contracted food poisoning. However, if you live nearby, then definitely give it a try, just don't get the fish!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I've been looking for the perfect fish and chips, crispy on the outside, soft tender fish and not too greasy during (and after). I'm so sad I need to drive all the way to Santa Barbara for it. I've never had a bad plate here though my go to is the fish and chips. The carne asada fries are made with good quality steak and my companions are addicted to the calamari. 

Have never tried the burgers but why would I stray from the fish?"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We had quiet a delicious, if chilly, dinner outside here while taking a quick Covid getaway to Carpinteria.  Husband had the tri-tip sandwich, I had a bbq chicken salad and 12 year old had the burger and everything was really yummy.  I didn't realize it was such a beachy vibe or we probably wouldn't have gone on such a cold night, but we will definitely go back again sometime when it's warm."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food is amazing!  This our new go-to spot for a perfect lunch!  The salads, burgers, sandwiches fish and chips are all hits with our family.  The staff us friendly and accurate.  The setting is amazing.  We come her often."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great Food with a lovely beach vibe.  We had the fish tacos and they were delish.  The tortillas were soft, the chips crispy, and the salsa had a kick. The line is a bit long but it was worth the wait.  I would definitely return."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is our go to place!!! It's amazing!!!! 
The food is delicious, and the ambiance is great!!! 
Lots of outdoor seating and the area is very big looks like a park and has a big sandy area for the kids to play. 
The front of the restaurant outdoor seating is nice because it's the dog area and they also have a very nice adults only area which is nice to get away from screaming kids. 
Amazing burgers!!! I highly recommend the pretzel burger, it is delicious. They are very accommodating as well with changing the patty's to veggie or making an substitutions. The California burger Is something we have gotten as well and it's just as good. 
They also have a full vegan menu!!! But be careful asking for an substitutions they will up charge you like crazy!!
The only thing that I would say they need to work on is the amount they charge on substitutions!!! A Vegan cheeseburger is $10 dollars and change the pretzel burger is $7.50 How do they end up charging a burger that is $7.50 to $10 something just for changing the patty to a veggie patty??? That was over 3 dollars they charged me just for that substitution!?!?!?! And when I have tried to order the Vegan cheeseburger and asking for the pretzel bun again they charge 3 plus??? 
I understand up charging but that much??? Little ridiculous!! Especially for bread!!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Just a couple blocks away from Santa Claus Beach, this is the perfect place to grab some food and drinks nearby whether you dine in the park-like patio or do take out. 

A friend and I were happy to have found the spot after a couple hours at the beach and walked over to dine in the patio for a quick and filling lunch. The patio is nicely sized with many bench style tables around that are nicely spaced out. They have umbrellas to block the sun and there's nice night lights for the evenings. The only thing better would be if the hedges were shorter so you can see the ocean right behind. 

Service is pretty quick after ordering and the food was ready in a timely manner even with a busy lunch! Nice staff and easy to deal with experience. 

Parking seems to be street only should be free. 

Their menu consists of various appetizers, fish/seafood specialties, salads, burgers, sandwiches, sides, and drinks (sodas, lemonade, waters, beer and wine) They have a vegan friendly menu available as well. 

Baja Fish Tacos - Fried snapper, cabbage, pico de gallo, smoked tartar, cilantro w/chips and red salsa on the side. Fried had these and liked them!

Calamari - Lightly breaded and fried, house tartar and cocktail sauce. Calamari was pretty good and I really liked the tartar sauce served with it. 

Fish & Chips - Fresh red snapper tempura beer battered and lightly fried, fries, homemade tartar sauce. Fish was nicely cooked and flaky, batter was crisp and light. Really good!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,What a fun outdoor eatery.  The food was delicious.  We ate the Baja fish tacos and the country club fried chicken sandwich.  The French fries were so good too.  Great place for families and kids.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I stopped in here for lunch on a weekday afternoon. This place is quite popular so there was a good sized line to place our orders. They give you a pager and you pick up your food when it is ready. They have numerous outdoor tables and a few inside, and we had no difficulty finding a nice table outside despite the large crowd. They have an extensive menu and everything looks great. I ordered the barbeque chicken salad which goes $10.75. It was quite large and well worth the money. I would definitely return here. The only concern I might raise is that the seating is primarily outdoors, so if you go there try to do it on a nice day."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is a great spot for lunch! We were able to find free parking which was great. There is plenty of seating outside and the vibes are great! They were playing fun music and while there was a pretty long line to order, the food was ready pretty quickly. Everything we ordered was great! I would definitely recommend stopping by for a casual lunch on a nice day. I definitely want to come back and try the fish tacos that are really popular!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Food is good and location is fantastic.  We had about 30 people walk up after a lacrosse tournament and they handled it no problem.  Great patio and the sunset view was amazing.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Food here is fresh and plentiful.

Prices are very fair too.

Varied menus. Burgers, salads, tacos

The back is a bunch of picnic tables overlooking the beach. 

Sand area for kids.

Great for young families.

You will want to stop here again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,So shoal! They used to use different patties and had different fries. I used to come here more often... not sure what happened but they're Quality has changed. Now I remember why I stopped coming here. The patties are tasteless hockey pucks and the buns fall apart and we order a fish sandwich that was still ice cold in the middle. It's making me nauseous just writing this I'm going to go now to go puke. Only two start cuz the landscaping is nice and the lemonade is great! lol oh well bye bye PB grill blahhh.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,I give the food here 5/5 very delicious I've had their burgers and sandwiches. Their sweet potato fries are really good. In my opinion the food is pricey but if your hungry and don't mind spending a bit more by all means yes. But well their service there is sometimes great sometime not so great just depends who takes your order. But the food and view are great.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Cute little place in north Carpinteria. Tons of outside setting with views of the ocean. Stopped by for lunch on a bike ride and tried the Shrimp and avocado salad which was large and tasty. You wait in a quick line to order and pick up your food pretty quickly. Can't wait to return and try more of the menu.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Grease bomb.  I should have known better when they gave me ten napkins.  They knew why.  I had to shower after eating the fish and chips.  Absolutely terrible.  No.  I asked twice if the tartar sauce was in the bag.  It was not.  This outdoor spot doesn't allow dogs.   Bye.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This spot is awesome.  Love the Hawaiian music playing and the vibe.  Walking in is very inviting like a Hawaiian take out joint with plenty of outdoor seating that had a nice view of the ocean.  It really reminded me off bring in Hawaii.

I ordered the grilled fish tacos and my friend the tuna melt.  We shared so we can try both.  The fish tacos were good and the fish was tender and moist.  They were flavorful and were a decent size.  The tuna melt was amazing!  Probably one of my favorites.  The toast is was toasted with butter snd cheese flavor and was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  The bread was fantastic.  The tuna inside was perfect also and wasn't drenched in mayo which I appreciated.  I would definitely order that again!!!!

I cant wait to go back when Im in the area.

Tip - go off hours to avoid the crowds!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What an adorable place!!! Loved the Ambience, the beautiful outside seating, the cozy and warm fire pits and the delicious food! I got the Turkey burger with caramelized onions and avocados, OMG!! My taste buds were bursting with joy!! Love it and can't wait to go back on a warmer day!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great place sit and take a moment...get off the freeway and chill with a cold drink and so,e yummy food.  The dining room is basically the beach so,you can't go wrong with the setting. 
It's right off the 101 as you head to/from Santa Barbara. 
Lots of parking. 
People come in right after spending the day at the beach.  It's very casual. Staff is super friendly."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place reminds me of being in Hawaii with the outdoor seating and palms. The food I think is a 3.5 but the outdoor ambiance is awesome. You can enjoy sone lunch here and go enjoy the beach afterwards.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"What is the wisdom of opening at 11:00 am and closing at 7 pm?? As a restauranteur, I know very well that 80% of dinner customers want to dine at 7 pm? I went there at 7, only to find the door locked and the manager told me, ""business falls off and we don't have the staff to serve you."" I have always got the impression of this place that the priority of the staff and manager is to themselves and not that caring about the customers. The management sets the hours when staff work. They thought, ""oh, we will sell more cheeseburgers at 11 am than at the dinner hour."" What a crock! The culture that the management has created is not right. Many service businesses prioritize the comfort and convenience of their clientele over that of the staff, who are perfectly fine staying through the dinner hour.
My other issue is that literally every time I have been there, the order is messed up. They forget this or they substitute that."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Stopped by on the way home to L.A. from the central coast. Right off fwy and can hop right back on. Free street parking. Great fun atmosphere- generous portions and the good is absolutely delicious. We had fish snd chops which was prepared to perfection with such a light and tasty batter. I had a Maui burger and the grilled pineapple took it over the top!! The kids ate all their food and that in itself is the ultimate compliment! Will absolutely be returning since we frequently travel back and forth to visit family. Highly recommend.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"So, Rincon's greatest new spot for lunch! What an oasis by the beach! 
Order: fast n friendly. 
Location: just off the 101! A spot to die for (come on it's Rincon)!
Atmosphere: chill, outdoor vibe with great tunes.
Food: hot, so yum and the suds are refreshing! 
Sitting outside on picnic tables just sanitized, in the sun amongst others safely distanced was a great experience. The full entire experience was simply wonderful! Cannot wait to head back!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stumbled upon this fabulous family-friendly spot yesterday when driving around the area with the top down on the convertible on a perfect SoCal Saturday afternoon.  

The view of grassy lawns and brightly colored umbrellas, plus tropical trees and plantings looked inviting from the street.

We were thinking of only a snack before dinner later in Santa Barbara, so ordered the nachos and a couple of drinks.  The nacho plate turned out to be an extremely generous helping.  Total bargain for $6.95!  That ended up being our dinner.

They served a gourmet bottled root beer for the root beer float, providing the rest of the bottle to keep filling the cup.  Dear Hubby tried the caramel latte shake and loved it.

Orders are placed inside the doors in a main room.  Self-serve beverage station is also in that room.  The lines for ordering move pretty quickly, with friendly hosts to take the order.  Menu boards provide the details.  Prices are very reasonable!  

Decor is beachy, but not in a cloying way.  Has a feel of a East Coast beach town, more so than West Coast.  Found that charming as a change of pace.

We took our pager outside and found a table by walking over a wooden bridge next to a pond with waterfall and lush tropical plantings.  A large sandy play area for kids lay to the left, with an extensive grassy section beyond.  

The pager went off quickly.  DH went to get the food while I chose a picnic table on the lawn area.  At 4:00 in the afternoon, there were plenty of empty tables to chose from.

As we dove into the nachos, we took in our surroundings and marveled how we'd never heard of this place before.  Later, walking to the perimeter fence revealed a view of the beach and shimmering blue Pacific.

Pretty wonderful venue!  Knocking off a star as it didn't look like they have anyone on staff routinely cleaning the tables and keeping it freshly clean outside.  Other than that, we really enjoyed the mini-getaway with it's tropical surroundings and reasonably priced eats."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great ambiance, good prices, nice staff delicious food! We love this place we brought a game, ate good food and hung out with an ocean view"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I had the fish tacos. The fish itself was not seasoned: not even salt and pepper. The aoli sauce was tasteless. I tried my daughter's fish and chips. The only seasoning on the fish was in the batter. With that said, there are other aspects of the experience that are positive and they are fair to mention. The fish was fresh and well cooked. The fries were well seasoned and my tortilla chips were crispy and light. Also, we only had the fish tacos and the fish and chips. I did take my leftovers home, seasoned and ate.

Here are positive points for the restaurant outside of our order: Quick line, outdoor and indoor seating, clean kitchen, a myriad of eating options: vegan menu, several fish specialties, salads, kids meals, burgers, sandwiches, sides, and desserts.
For drinking options include soft drinks, draft beers, canned beers, wine by glass or bottle. Sat & Sun specials - Mimosa buy one and get the second one half off

There is also an Adults Only area outside and the locale is by the beach! So, as you can see, those might be good reasons to check Padaro out. 

Prices are reasonable and comparable to dinner prices for food items. ""charge tip"" - or ""service charge""- on pay stub is the tip that you gave if you used the credit card

I am glad that I checked it out. I am just not sure that I would make a trip specifically to eat there again."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Padaro Beach Grill is more than just another simple American grill by the beach. What makes them unique is the healthy food options, including a vegan menu!  Don't just stop at tacos, burgers, and salads, grab a dessert and treat yourself.

They handmake their shakes, smoothies and floats. I ordered a classic Root Beer Float that made me nostalgic of my childhood. Simple, classic, and not dense and heavy. 

NOTE: Unfortunately, Padaro Beach Grill no longer allows dogs on the patio, which is a major downside since we take our fur babies everywhere!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Service was great , the food was terrific, the view and the eating area was outstanding we will come back for sure"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Heads up travelers with dogs. This place is not dog friendly even though it states on Yelp that they are. You will Not be able to eat with your furry friend here, sadly."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Warning: No longer dog friendly. 
They do NOT allow dogs in their outdoor dining area anymore which is disappointing after years of bringing our dog with us here. We had already ordered our food & were sitting at a table when we were told our pup was not allowed & we would have to leave or put our dog in the car while we ate. Wish we would've been told before we ordered our food. Needless to say we took our food & left."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Excellent food. I have tried 90% of the menu. If you're out this way then stop by. You won't regret it.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food&beer at a good price. Close to a great beach. What, do you want more?! There isn't, and doesn't need to be..."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely delicious spot at a beautiful location. I've been coming here for the burgers since I was a kid! The vibe here is completely laid back, perfect for the beachfront. There is a ton of outdoor seating, none indoor. It's usually easy to find a table either away from the beach in the shade or close to it in the sun. My favorite is the Padaro burger, and their fries are so fresh and delicious. I finished with the cookie shake which was a 4 out of 5."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,One of the best burgers I have ever tasted!! I had the Padaro Burger (The avocado was mashed and the BBQ sauce was tangy and thick). All the toppings worked well together. So we'll I couldn't put my burger down. My husband ordered the California Burger and he too loved the taste! These burgers were so big we were glad to be sharing an order of sweet potato fries. We will definitely be back when passing through in the future!! Take the time to enjoy the large outdoor park setting with plenty of tables with umbrellas in the back.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Came down to SB to visit family, & ohhh my gosh I can't believe we didn't come here before! Their special tri-tip fries, salad, & calamari were to die for! Definitely won't be the last time we come here! Service was fairly good & fast despite the long line. I definitely recommend you try this place out!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Cute place! 

You walk in, order your food and they give you a buzzer. 

There is only street parking. It looked really crowded but it only took a couple of minutes to find a spot. 

The outside is really spacious. They have a lot of tables that are really set apart. The ocean is near by but you can't see it while eating, the bushes are blocking the view. Nonetheless, great spot. They had some good tunes and a lot of shade. 

The service was fast. The Baja fish tacos were okay. I was expecting so much more. Something about the breading was off for me. The sweet potato fries were great!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Oh MAN... drove from LA (83 miles) just to eat here and enjoy the beautiful DOG FRIENDLY patio. $55 for 4 items, and 2 drinks, great prices.

10/10 Fish & Chips: light and fluffy battered crispy fresh fish, golden chips.
10/10 Coleslaw: light, fresh, and crunchy (my favorite)
10/10 Clam Chowder: light, whipped, full of flavor. I like how this chowder is not to heavy or watery
10/10 Padaro Burger with BLUE CHEESE. 

They sell Hard Kombucha & have plenty of beers on tap.

The quality of the food is amazing. You can taste that everything is made with love and care. I would eat here every weekend if I lived closer.

Parking along the street. Fast service, really clean patio, dog friendly. Beautiful views, on a beautiful beach."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a fun place to eat! It's beautiful. On the beach in a grassy area, picnic tables, gardens, fire pit , and pretty good food. I love the atmosphere. We ordered the fried chicken sandwich and nachos, good portions and they were delicious. Beer on tap, too! I'll be back for sure."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I love this place! Just knowing I'm on my way there makes me happy; once I get there I'm all smiles! The outdoor eating area is THE BEST! Even on a day when the weather isn't awesome this place is!  If you hit it on a sunny California day, you get a pitter-patter in your heart and your insides sing!

So that's just the environment alone, then you add the delicious food and you become completely giddy.  The prices are reasonable, I don't think other reviewers are taking the literal beach front location into consideration. 

When I'm here I smile from ear to ear and I leave this place blissfully stuffed- you will too!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Stopped by after a day at Rincon beach.  Had a refreshing pale ale & grilled fish tacos.  My daughter had a cheeseburger.  The place is so cute!  Felt like we were in Hawaii!!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"We had a fantastic lunch today. My family stopped for a bite and we got so much food! We ordered fish tacos. Each one is very generous and delicious. Plus you get chips and salsa. And my son got the pretzel burger which was really delicious too. We shared the Tri tip French fries and they are a huge portion with a lot of sour cream, pico de Gallo and avocado. Loved it all and the setting! We will definitely return!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This amazing beach grill seats you on a picnic table right on the sand! The food is scrumptious and the salty air welcoming. Great for the entire family!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"It's a one of a kind experience.  A sandbox for the kiddies, very large outdoor area with casual picnic and regular tables.  Issues: Not enough table umbrellas on a hot day, no dogs allowed (really?), and it's on the beach, but has bushes so tall you can't really see the sand.  For sunsets, for sure, yes.

Get in line.  Counter ordering, not full-service, is what causes the long line to be formed.  Allow 30 mins to get thru it.  The menu has a mix of fast foods, sandwiches, salads, and on Sunday - BBQ (I think 11a-3p).

I got an order of the Shrimp Tacos ($9.95) -- grilled tequila-lime shrimp, shredded cabbage, tomato, avocado, cilantro cream sauce, handmade corn tortillas, chips, pico de gallo.  The chips were the best thing on the plate.  The shrimp was just okay (costco?), but mainly the problem was it swimming in the cream sauce.  No bueno.  (2.5 stars)

My gf ordered the Beach Club Sandwich ($7.50), and had to send it back...so darn greasy.  She got a salad instead, and it was the wrong one and way too simple at that.  Not worth getting back to the counter and waiting again, so she ate it like a good sport.  Again, no service so you are forced to do it yourself.

If you have small kids and need a break from it all, this is your place.  Overall, I wouldn't come here for the food, or the live band (ma & pa band doing 1970's covers)."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"How have I not been here before?!

Wonderful beach cafe!

You order at a counter and they give you a pager so that you can roam around before your food is ready.

Beautiful, grassy outdoor area with picnic tables.  It reminds me of a private club or a great party at a nice house.  There is a big sand pit for kids to play.

Great burger, tasted more ""homemade"" than any that I remember in a restaurant.  Maybe it just tasted like my dad cooks them on a grill, so that's ""homemade"" for me.  The onion rings were awesome!  I'll be eating those again.

I thought the prices were great for a beach cafe."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Really enjoyed trying this place on our way up to Santa Barbara. A coworker of mine recommended this place since we are such fans of The Habit and Hook Burger, which I heard are same owners as Padaro.

My boyfriend and I visited this pace during lunch time on a Saturday and perfectly sunny day. I can see parking being hard to find since the location is right by the beach, with lots of visitors parking on the street. Luckily we found one that was a little walk away.

Padaro looks exactly what is named as, a cute beach grill!! There are plenty of outside patio seating, and a sandbox area for the kids. It was such a beautiful day so we of course sat outside. The menu is very similar to that of Hook Burger and The Habit, with a few differences here and there. 

You order your food inside. We ordered the Hickory Bacon Burger, and the Angus Burger, plus the Fries and Rings combo, and with a refreshing beer on the side.

The order was pretty quick, with the food tasting as delicious as expected. If you are looking for a good burger spot to stop by, I'd definitely recommend this place, especially if you have kids with you.

The beach is walks away, but know that parking can be a bit of a pain! I can't wait to come back here during the summer and enjoy the sun and a yummy burger from here."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"After a hiking adventure in Montecito, my boyfriend and I stopped by Padro Beach Grill for a bite to eat. We ordered via Yelp app, fulfilled by Grubhub, to pick up our order and everything went smoothly.  Service was nice. Due to COVID-19 restrcitions, patio-dining area was closed and so we pulled up to a lot with ocean view to eat in our car.  

Fish and chips is a red snapper battered, with French fries and tartar sauce for $11.50.  Baja Fish Tacos was the same red snapper battered with shredded cabbage, tartar sauce, cilantro, pico del gallo on a single homemade corn tortilla for $9.95 -and tacos came with chips and salsa as well. Fish batter is a bit thick, but overall we were pleased with our food as price point is perfect for overall portion size. Great beach side cafe that I'd definitely recommend for bite to eat.  Thanks, Padro Beach Grill."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a nice surprise! This restaurant is like a landmark it's like an oasis, beautiful shangrila by the sea! I was not going to eat I'm glad my daughter insisted I do as we still need to drive a long stretch to get to Solvang. 
There were so many kinds of burgers  I didn't know what to get but luckily I chose the right one ! The California burger had grilled burger, grilled red pepper, onions, grilled buns w yummy Mayo, it's mouth watering n a yuuuge scoop of fresh guacamole  on top of the burger! Wow  it was only $9, anywhere else this would be $11 or $12, I also ordered chili  plus a coke out the door $20. My daughter ordered  corn dog, the dough was crunchy n the dog was delicious.
5 stars! I even rate this 6 stars if that was possible. Whoo hoo! I'm in Meghan Markle neighborhood here near Montecito."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Drove all the way over at 7:35 pm and the open sign was out and hours on Yelp were until 8pm and staff told us they were closed. :(
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I rented out Padaro for our rehearsal dinner. It was such a magical night. The food was excellent and the string lights made it so special. It was a little chilly that night, but Will lit the fire and turned on all of the heaters. Our guests could not stop talking about the beautiful venue, amazing dinner, and laid back atmosphere. A huge thanks to Will and the Padaro team!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Fantastic! This place is excellent. All the food is amazing.   Delicious sweet treats. Wonderful park area that is super kid friendly. Will definitely be back.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,We were told to leave due to having our dog with us. I get and understand being not friendly but as an outdoor restaurant I don't get it. What also made me more upset is that there were 3 other parties with their dogs who we asked about and were told they were service dogs. There were zero indicators showing that they were service dogs including their behavior. Either way it was a shame since we were looking forward to the meal.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Friendly Staff, Beautiful Location...plenty of outdoor seating, which made me feel comfortable! I'm thinking I didn't order well...maybe the seafood is the way to go. I ordered the tri-tip sandwich. The tri-tip was tough and seasoned with a bunch of garlic salt.  I tried a small piece of fish from the Fish and Chips, which seems like something I would enjoy more.  The buttered bread from my sandwich didn't taste like anything. I'll try them again, and try the seafood next time, because I really love this location!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Met some locals on the beach and they recommend this place for families with kids and to hang out with friends and family. Really good food and beer on tap and awesome beach vibe.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Padaro burger is awesome. Kids menu are great as well. All the food tastes fresh and they make it pretty fast. Only option is for pick up and delivery. We picked up.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"No dogs allowed, and it was much too hot to leave Mr Joe Bite'n in the car. For a burger or salad, there are other places in town with the same cuisine that is canine friendly."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely wonderful! The food is fantastic. I had a Grilled chicken sandwich and chili cheese fries! The grilled chicken sandwich was made to perfection the toasted bread was to die for & the chicken cooked perfect it was juicy and flavorful. The chili cheese fries were so cheesy and loaded with chili they were delicious! The best location to have lunch or dinner it is amazing. The train passing by the beach, the waves crashing  on the sand. Beautiful and delicious!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We were in Carpinteria for a vacation and we ended up coming here 3 times because we liked it so much. My kids both loved the chicken nugget kids meals and playing in the sand with all the sand toys that were provided. I enjoyed the chili burger and the fried green beans. My husband enjoyed the pretzel burger and the guacamole and chips oh and of course the beer. It was so nice to let the kids play while we relaxed with beautiful ocean views.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"It was such a beautiful day to dine outside and their outdoor dining area had all the right feels. It gave me a bit of an island vibe. If you're worried about social distancing, the tables are pretty spaced apart. 

Between two people, we ordered the Baja fish tacos and the grilled fish tacos (I forgot to snap a pic). They use red snapper for their tacos. I loved their Baja fish taco!! The fish portion was generous, batter was light and crispy, fish was moist and the toppings just made it all great!! The grilled fish tasted a bit fishier too me and in the taco they shred it up a bit. I felt it was more dry. Both tacos were more challenging to eat (compared to other fish tacos I've had) because the corn tortilla were way too soft. On the bright side, the toppings that fell off the Baja fish taco were used as toppings for the bed of tortilla chips it came with. Yum!! I would definitely come back, soft tortilla or not lol."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"After a great first visit a few weeks ago, we took visiting family here last Saturday evening after spending a few hours at Carpinteria State Beach. 

As it was Saturday night, the line to order was a bit long, but still moved quickly.   Took a while for our orders to come up, but we were hanging out at our table and enjoying the summer weather and tropical atmosphere. 

The burgers aren't huge, but at well under $10, the portion corresponds with the price.  Fair value. 

I tried the shrimp salad for a lighter option.  The serving was very generous.  The Thousand Island dressing tasted like it was made on site and not out of a bottle.  It was a good complement to the salad ingredients. 

The kids ran around till it was time to eat. Which was perfect.  The front lawn area has hexagonal picnic tables spread around with plenty of space in between so that we didn't feel crowded.

NOTE:  They don't stay open late on Saturday nights.  We were hoping for some live music, but there wasn't any that night."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Me & my family came to eat to this restaurant while our vacation in Santa Barbara , my daughter looked it up and we were very happy with our food ! Everything was amazing you can't go wrong with anything on their menu & it's very family friendly you feel so relaxed in their outdoor sitting area they even have a area with sand for the kids . Eat here you won't regret it everyone who works there is very friendly ."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Damn, I'd give this little gem a 20+ if I could! The vibes....ahhhh the vibes....abd the food!!!! So so so good!!! The fish tacos, the shrimp tacos, calamari, the clam strips....all excellent abd so fresh! Everything came out so quickly 
            If you want chill beach vibes, top notch fresh food, friendly fast service and just good times, come here!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food and service!

My only complaint (NOT FOR PADARO BEACH GRILL) was for the parents who were too into their conversation, food and drinks that they forgot about their kids in the sandy area and one of the toddlers started wandering off into the street. It was a big walk for this child but nonetheless, almost made it out had we not made a run for her to stop her."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Omg. This view is EVERYTHING !!!!! Will definitely be coming back again. Fabulous outdoor area. I can only imagine how packed they are on the weekends. I luckily was able to experience this place on a Friday afternoon. While everyone is stuck in traffic. lol. But I'll be in the traffic soon as well. Haha
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Great food. Fresh! Lovely beachy setting with good shade. Trees for climbing. Kids playing. No dogs.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"This is one of my favorite places to eat at when visiting! 

You've gotta try their Oreo milkshakes!!! My go to meal is a chili, Padaro Burger, Fries or Onion Rings, and Oreo Milkshake!

We also really like their Fish & Chips, Tuna Melt, and Chicken Caesar Salad :)"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,For me this place is about all around experience. I could sit there for hours sharing yummy food and good times with family and friends. It's like a great burger joint that happens to be right on the beach. Theres something for everyone on the menu. Great prices. Great staff. Great selection of drafts beers you can order by the pitcher.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I ordered the Tri Tip fries and I've had them before and they're delicious. I don't want to write negatively because I love the food here but a strong suggestion would be to not put hot fries with melted cheese in a plastic container :( the fries melted the plastic and I had to pick at the fries and turn them upside down to remove small pieces of plastic,(it was a 6 min drive home)I ended up not eating them so I was bummed :( I tried calling but I'm assuming they were busy and couldn't get to the phone. These are delicious, I would just recommend they put them in a different container."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Oh my goodness how fun is this place?!  Really good food.  Primarily burgers and tacos with lots of sides.  We had the grilled fish tacos and they were really good.  Everything is very reasonably priced.  They have better selection of wine and beers than I would have expected.  Seating is outdoors around picnic tables.  Close to the beach.  Some tables have views.  Places for kids to play.  And also an area for just adults.  What's not to like?  We will be regulars here.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Love everything about this place.  Location.  View. Staff.  Food.  Drinks.  Atmosphere. A must stop destination for food n drinks..
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Wonderful place for lunch, one of my favorite.  The whole place is like dining in Hawaii.  You get in line, order your drinks and booze, and then sit in their huge outdoor patio.  

Food:  Fish and Chips 12$ are a 10/10.  Fish Sandwhich 12$ was a 7/10, the fish was a tad undercooked and small for the size of bread it was on, and should come with fries for the price you pay.  The Mango Margarita was a 8/10 on the rocks, but over priced as well for 10$.  The Calamari was a 9/10, great tarter sauce 9$.

Decor:  Its like eating in Hawaii, 10/10.

Price:  Prices are average, however alcohol should be lower, 10$ for a basic margarita on the rocks made in under 3 seconds is excessive, should be more like 7$.  Food prices are average between 10-14$.

This place will be my new go to for delicious outdoor brunch next time we visit."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,We come back again and again. Our favorite place to go after a nice beach day on Santa klaus lane. They have a plethora of vegan/vegetarian options which is always extremely appreciated. I think the menu overall has great variety. Portions are big and the seating is relaxed and family oriented. Sometimes the line to order can be long but they try to keep it moving along. Our only wish was all the tables had umbrellas. We are always eyeing to get an umbrella table out front. We'll be back!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Food was good and prices were amazing for a restaurant so near the beach.  Precautions for Covid were great.  Spacing for waiting to place an order and table distance was comfortable.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great food. Reasonably priced food, especially being on the beach. Beer is cheep. Staff are always very friendly and courteous. A+++"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I love Padaro Beach Grill. We came for the first time in June, for dinner with friends and our kids, and have already been back once despite living in Los Angeles. It's a perfect spot for a casual meal with small children, and I think we'll come pretty much whenever we're visiting family in Santa Barbara for more than a couple of days.

It is, as the name suggests, a beachside grill, with a ton of open outdoor space. You order from a cashier inside--service was fast and friendly on both our visits--and listen for your number to come up over a (loud enough but unobtrusive) loudspeaker. You take your food to one of several picnic tables on a lawn with a view of the ocean, just on the other side of some hedges and train tracks. There's plenty of room for kids to roam, and plenty for them to look at, including the occasional passing train.

The atmosphere is super calm and relaxing, and wonderfully, Padaro offers alcohol. I've enjoyed both a strawberry jalapeño margarita and a glass of house white (a chardonnay or a sauvignon blanc, I forget which). The food is simple and, frankly, much better than it needs to be. The shrimp tacos are delicious, with grilled shrimp, shredded cabbage, tomato, avocado, and cilantro cream sauce on handmade corn tortillas, served with some addictive chips and salsa roja. The guacamole is great, too. The burgers are fast food-style, with thin patties, and super satisfying. I like the Maui burger with fresh grilled pineapple, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and teriyaki sauce.

Our toddler enjoys this place, and we plan to bring him back often, as it's such an easy spot to get a tasty meal with a view of the water. On our first visit, he sat on his dad's shoulders and stared at the ocean, and it might have been his first time really taking it in. Padaro Beach Grill is so pleasant that it's almost a bonus that the food happens to be good. I suspect we'll make a lot of memories here."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Awesome service; great outdoor seating and the food came out quick even with the line out the door!! Had a great experience here!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped here for lunch on our way up to SB. We've been to the cafe next door a couple times but this was our first time here. We ordered a burger & some clam chowder at the counter & took our pager out back to find seating. Their private outdoor seating is really nice. There are picnic tables set up & it's really family friendly. They have a small, raised patio area with seating just for adults if you'd rather be away from the little ones. When the pager goes off you go get your food from the same counter where you ordered it.

The food was good. My burger was cooked to a nice medium, very fresh & flavorful. The chowder was good too. Maybe a tad pricy for the small portion size; it cost more than the burger. Overall good experience though. Would return!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"What a fantastic place to share a meal with the most important people in my life.  The location is envious; wide open outdoor dining overlooking our beautiful Pacific Ocean.  Everyone there seemingly enjoying food, conversation and for the most part, life itself.  

You order at the counter and prepay, then take the buzzer with you and pick any table of your choice.   It's all open picnic table kind of seating.  Then once you get buzzed you go pick up your tray full of food and grab your drinks and enjoy.  The wife and kids had a great time and they even have separate ""adult areas"" if youre trying to get away from the little ones for just a  bit.  Burgers were great (get the hickory burger if you are a fan of bacon) and the weather was just right and all was well in my practically perfect little world."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This spot is exactly as advertised and never fails.  The food has been consistently good since I've been going there almost every month for the past 2 years.  The environment accommodates everything from stressed parents of toddlers to work colleagues having a happy hour.  My only complaint is the seasonal/weekend/surfing business that makes it hard to get service as a local.  Suggestion:  menu changes every now and again.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,Food was so good! Got fish and chips with sweet potato fries and a burger. The good came out pretty quickly and was all fresh. The location of this place is great the view is spectacular!
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,The service was great and fast I ordered a california burger and sweet potato fries. It's a nice shaded outdoor area with with a small pond and a sand play area for the kids (no access to the beach) [the beach and restaurant are separated by train tracks]
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place is a classic must stop for our family.  The beachside picnic eating area is perfect for families.  We try and grab lunch here whenever we are in Santa Barbara.  The food is good and people are friendly.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Location. Location. Location. Right off the beach, bench seating under some tiki umbrellas. Amazing place to go on a sunny day. Went for lunch and ordered the shrimp and avocado salad with vinaigrette dressing instead of the thousand island, the sweet potato fries, and a glass of sauvignon blanc, ran a little over $20. My friend ordered the nachos and a local brew, I love when a restaurant does local brews. It was way too much for her. All in all, food was, eh. I just liked the fact that you can have a beer or a glass (cup) of wine outdoors. And if there was a 3.5, I'd probably rate it that. But since I'm an aspiring foodie, I'd say a hard 3 for sure. And I'm paleo, so food has a different standard of rating all together. I'd come back with drinker friends who are tired of Ventura's downtown midday scene."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,Wouldn't know about the food. They don't allow dogs on their giant outdoor eating space with grass and trees. Seems like a  pretty backwards policy. Won't bother coming back
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,This place is fantastic as always!   So nice to chill and have a beer while my kiddo digs in a big sandbox :).  We can stay here for hours.   Food is great burgers and fries and the best salads!   Gotta check it out u will not be disappointed.
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Oh, man!  Best goddamned cheeseburger I've had in a long time!

This might be one of those, ""oh, we have to stop at Padaro's"" rituals every time I drive past Carpinteria."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"My cousin reserved this restaurant for her rehearsal dinner 6 months prior. Upon arriving, we were told that we did not have any tables reserved and that a corporate party was underway. Not only did we not have a table, but the beach view was blocked by wood sheets. Terrible service."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"We were in town on business (ohhh doesn't that sound important) on a Sunday and we were hungry for a burger or two. We looked up the directions to this place and it was just off of the 101.

Parking is all street/strand and it was very crowded today. The inside of the restaurant is just for ordering and picking up your food. The girls behind the counter really kept that long lunch line moving. We kept seeing customers pick up their orders and we decided what to get solely on what we saw coming out of the kitchen.

I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich and sweet potato fries. My fiance ordered the hickory burger and regular fries.

Our food came out super fast compared to how busy this place was! The eating area outside is large and has a space for live entertainment. Sunday It was a Dixie land band and they were very good! They have a sand pit with toys for the kids to play in and lots of benches with umbrellas. The beach is right next to the restaurant. The good thing about this place is they know how to draw the line between family friendly and ""I just need to eat something"". They have a roped off section for adults to eat and not be disturbed. We didn't mind watching kids chase birds while we ate, though.

The food itself was good, but not great. I liked that they had an outside condiment station because if you forgot the mustard you didn't have to leave your food and go very far inside to ask for more. I guess they did this because they have a bird problem. I really liked my sweet potato fries. My fiance said his burger was juicy, but he'd had better burgers. 

I would like to stop in again and try a salad or their fish tacos. A lot of people were ordering fish tacos. Beautiful outside landscape with the added bonus of live entertainment on weekends!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"I try to eat here every time I'm up in the area. Good food and great atmosphere 

Danny G"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Padaro Beach grill is a wonderful place to eat lunch, especially with their marvelous outdoor seating area right next to the beach. There really isn't another place like it in Santa Barbara. 

The food was quite delicious, especially the BBQ chicken salad. It was a very large salad split between two people and was quite filling on it's own. We also split the Maui Burger (lettuce wrapped) and that was more along the lines of a standard beach grill burger (hence the 4 stars). We will definitely be returning to try other things on the menu as both the grilled chicken sandwich and the fish tacos looked fantastic. We also thoroughly enjoyed the salad and would order that again in a heart beat!

This is definitely a gem in Santa Barbara and is a wonderful place if you want a relaxing place to enjoy a wonderful meal by the beach on a gorgeous Santa Barbara afternoon!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Love it! Have been there twice now. The view is to die for. The food was tremendous (Nachos, fries, etc.) except that somehow I forgot what burger I ordered the first time (that I didn't like) and got the same one. I saw ""chile"" burger and thought it was CHILI not chiles. Anyways, I can't wait to go back."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The atmosphere of this place was the best part I think. I loved how it was right over the beach and there was a huge open lawn area with benches and tables and music. This place would be great for kids because they have a big sand pit with toys and such. There's also an area for adults only. I'm assuming it gets crowded on Friday nights. The food was good and the fries were the best part. 

The only thing I didn't like is that we were basically the only ones there. However we did go during the day so I'm assuming it picks up at night."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Awesome good AND atmosphere!  Right on the beach in Carpinteria.  We stopped here on our way to a Paso Robles girls weekend, but it's also am awesome place for families.  Definitely coming back!!"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Decent food, great location.  We chose here because we thought we would be looking at the surf.  They have a great picnic area, but the beach is obscured by a hedge..."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Pretty mediocre food, but I have kids so its a pretty fun place for them since there's lots of outdoor area to play around in. Its fairly huge portion sizes and not super healthy. I'd say the Pretzel Burger is probably the best thing I've had there. The shrimp tacos are decent too."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Ok this spot has a cool concept. Basically you order your food and can sit down in a play area for kids while enjoying your food, drinks and watching your kids play, all while you enjoy the beautiful beach side weather.

We had heard it gets really crowded and been told to make a reservation before coming. So we called a few days before but we were told to make a reservation online. So we did that, sent the message on the website but didn't hear back for a couple days. Then I sent a message on Yelp the day before and got a message back within 2 hours saying we had a reservation. Great!

So the next day we are en route, running a few mins late, as usual with 3 kids, so I wanted to call to notify them. There was no answer. Ugh. When we arrived, we found a line to order all the way back outside the door onto the sidewalk. Double ugh. So this place IS popular. Ok. We waited in line, finally got to the front and placed our order. We got our drinks (yes, they serve limited alcohol/beer, even though the drinks are kinda weak) and walked through the playground to find a table. We found a table with our name on it, even though we were a little behind the time slot written on the card. Some other people had sat down there and were eating but politely moved when we said it was reserved for us. No problem. After all, we were late. I think they gave us a buzzer to let us know when our food was ready. The food was not great. I felt like I was eating cafeteria food (I had a burger and fries) but the atmosphere was cool. It was laid back, relaxed and fun for the kids. It was the typical beach like atmosphere. I'd come back for sure but I'd definitely try to order something different."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"The burgers are so good! super filling get the barbecue burger has deep fried onions, grilled onions and they are generous with the cheese and avocado which i love! fries are alright but the burgers are the real star of this restaurant. Also a lovely view of the ocean is near by. There may be a wait on the weekend but its totally worth the wait"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"I love this place, however I was really disappointed in the tri tip sandwich. Meat was chew and had to pull most of it out . Rubber meat is no bueno"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great fast friendly service!
Definitely will be back again when in town !
Daughter got the kids tenders and ate all
I ordered the Baja tacos and was a huge portion came with chips and it was the best tacos I've tasted"
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,positive,"Great vegan menu! Got the vegan burger with sweet potato fries, both were perfect. I'll have to come back to try their other vegan menu items soon! I love this place, and so close to the beach, it's awesome."
1FURjeGJi_LBXcJQg8eskw,Padaro Beach Grill,Mexican,negative,"Would be great & has been however now even though there entire seating area is out doors they don't allow dogs. When I was in line several people left because of that, your business will most likely suffer."
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I go here all the time and absolutely love it. Authentic, great quality Mexican street food. The portions are fantastic, we usually split the carne fries and can't even finish them because the portions are so filling! The service is awesome, the guys are super kind and generous and really do just the best job. 10000/10 recommend this place !!!!!"
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,"Great find. Had the nachos and fries! Great food! Friendly service, highly recommend! :)"
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,This food is amazing! We stopped 2 days in a row and ordered different items... Everything we ordered from tacos to the burgers was excellent!! BBQ burger & birria tacos!!!
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,"I did it!!!! Deeeelicious tortas!!!!
Asada meat great, bread soft and toasted. Flavorful and worth every dime!!!
I finished it before I could take a picture but...I shall return!!!"
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,Fabulous  food. Big yummy burritos like they are supposed to to be. Savory tacos. Big Cokes in glass. Support this business with your food dollars if you can. One of the best deals in town
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,negative,"I have eaten at Food Connection 3 times. The first couple experiences were great. The food was tasty and left me craving more! But last night I ate the pastor nachos and my boyfriend had the pastor burrito, and unfortunately we are both trying to recover from food poisoning. We both had pleasant experiences the first couple times, but now I don't think I can look at this food truck the same way again."
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,The food is fantastic!! No complaints about that. Only thing that has called my attention is that the times I have came to get food the customer service isn't great and I never even get a thank you. It feels like I am bothering the cashier by ordering. Besides that the food is amazing! Keep up the good cookin!
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,"My coworkers and I stopped by here for lunch only to find the truck window closed. However, as we were leaving the owner walked up and offered to cook us something despite being closed for the day. We all ended up ordering a variety of mulitas - it was my first time trying them and they were delicious (a bit like a quesadilla but with small tortillas sandwiching the fillings); the meats and salsas were all on point. Mostly I appreciated the kindness and hospitality we received here!"
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,"Delicious! Handmade made from scratch tortillas. My goodness. I cook and am often critical  with food- but the chicken, carne asada, and pastor tacos are the best I've had! My man said the burger was the best he's had in a long time. Wait is worth! Definitely order from them. We don't eat from food trucks, but decides to give it a go, and have zero regrets. And to add- the gentleman who was taking the orders wanted to make sure he included utensils in our bag and walked over to where we were sitting and brought us extra. That's above and beyond!"
GEGTsaKaO1R9fFB4sGS5qw,Santa Barbara Food Connection,Mexican,positive,Food truck was on East Beach Santa Barbara Cabrillo Pavillion. I legit had the best tacos of my life at this truck. I'm 42 years old and these are the best! I had the biccia red tacos and they were a amazing! Don't miss it! And the lemonade basil cucumber. Delicious!
Qi-A4ZgcEuSnq_8Fpfo_3Q,Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado,Mexican,positive,"Only open during Fiesta, the first weekend (friday at noon, sat and sun 10am) in August!!! If you are in Santa Barbara at all on this week of celebration and you love authentic Mexican food you must come here!  You will love all the great food they offer here and the dancing and music.  There is beer and wine.  I usually come here for a big bowl of pazole for breakfast, but before I do that you must order some tomales.  Get here early for the tamales because the line gets long.  This place is the real deal.  And not to be missed if your a serious foodie. Viva la Fiesta!!!"
Qi-A4ZgcEuSnq_8Fpfo_3Q,Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado,Mexican,positive,"I had an awesome Old Spanish Days Fiesta experience at Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado.  It's held a bit away from the normal festivities downtown, but that makes it feel that much more local an less touristy.  

The festival was very organized.  I mean, from the vendors clearly labeled, to the tents covering the tables, and the stage set up with performances, everything was taken care of to provide a great experience.

The food was yummy and cheap!

Elotes $3
You can never go wrong with fresh, grilled corn smothered in mayo, parmesan, and chili pepper.

Enchilada combo plate $7
The cheese enchiladas with red sauce were yummy.  They didn't skimp on the sour cream on top either.  The best part was the rice.  I don't know how the Spanish rice was made, but it was full of flavor and the best I've had.  Very simple, yet very tasty.

Gordita $3
Frijoles y queso gordita with the works.  The gordita was chewy and was the perfect vehicle for the tasty beans and cheese inside.  

Pozole $6
I wanted badly to try the pozole, but alas, my tummy was stuffed.  

There's always next year!"
Qi-A4ZgcEuSnq_8Fpfo_3Q,Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado,Mexican,positive,The only place to go for authentic Mexican food during Fiesta!
Qi-A4ZgcEuSnq_8Fpfo_3Q,Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado,Mexican,positive,"This event is held Friday through Sunday every year during Santa Barbara's Old Spanish Days Fiesta.

While the images that are mostly associated with Fiesta are those of public drunkenness and long lines of people trying to get into bars and clubs along State Street , the Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado shows you the true spirit of Fiesta.

It's far from all the tourists and students and has that local flavor and vibe. There's no charge to come into the Mercado. It's held outdoors next to the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church where you'll find booths having some of the best authentic Mexican food you can find. Be prepared to bring cash as I didn't see any ATMs there...

Tacos de Birria (spicy and awesome)

Elotes (hot off the grill!)

Gorditas (not the fake Taco Bell ones, the awesome ones)

Tamales (the Pork ones are better than the Chicken ones, but be prepared to wait, the line can get long)

Enchiladas (they ran out of the meat ones by the time we got to them, but the Cheese & Onion ones were pretty good)

Pozole (didn't get to try it, but my friend says it was great, it looked pretty red and spicy for a Pozole).

On top of the food, you get some free entertainment on the stage- cultural dances, music, etc.

The Mercado is great and I definitely plan on coming for many more years to come."
Qi-A4ZgcEuSnq_8Fpfo_3Q,Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado,Mexican,positive,"Guadalupe church is way off the beaten path but it's no longer a secret location during Fiesta's. This is the place you want to come to for good authentic Mexican food. It opens the week of Fiesta's on Friday at noon, and it lasts through Sunday. They have the most authentic food and the most popular choices among customers are the tamales and posole.

I've tried the taquitos, flautas, roasted corn, and tri-tip sandwiches. They are all delicious!! 

They don't allow you to bring in confetti eggs so leave those in your car or you will be asked to dispose of them. C'mon now is it that serious? They are just eggs! 

Parking is kind of hectic to find since you have to park in the neighborhoods surrounding the church so come with patience."
Qi-A4ZgcEuSnq_8Fpfo_3Q,Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado,Mexican,positive,"Ay carumba! 
 
I know, it's a secret...but it's not.

If you're here for fiesta, do yourself a favor and visit this local institution. 

Some of the best times can be had here - COLOR BALL - LOTERIA! Plus the food is fantastic. Have the pozole for sure and really anything else, you won't be sorry.

Viva la Fiesta!"
Qi-A4ZgcEuSnq_8Fpfo_3Q,Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado,Mexican,positive,"Pass security and bam, best Mercado every Fiestas!

The go-to items include elote (roasted corn), tamales (chicken or pork), Agra frescas (pineapple or strawberry are my fav), and pasole (awesome soup). With games and entertainment, plus alcohol for those who wish to partake, this Mercado is by far the best food and atmosphere.

Plus, it benefits a local organization immensely and isn't full of just visitors. After a nice meal, head to the Courthouse for an evening of dancing under the stars!"
Qi-A4ZgcEuSnq_8Fpfo_3Q,Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercado,Mexican,positive,"This place is the best food and music 
For Fiesta
So glad someone sent me here
Fabulous torta with barbecued tri tip. 
Do fresh grilled to perfection 
Open till 9 going back
Best chicken tamale on the planet
The chicken  flautas were crispy with fresh shredded chicken and guacamole and cheese on the top 
Great authentic dancers and mariachi with vibrant speakers"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"If I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.

I refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Place for latest night eats around and drive through is a must. New menu items and some veggie options etc. forgot to put my dessert order in the bag though so I was very bummed when I noticed far too late!
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"This place has the worst customer service. My friend and I went to jack in the box at 12:30AM on a Wednesday night. We were the only ones there and I went to order my food and said okay so that's it for that order, we're gonna have a second order and he said we actually can't do two orders and I understand that during a rush or something but we were the only ones there. So I said that and said well we are literally the only people in the drive thru, like what difference does it make? And he was like you can come in the store and do two orders and I was wasn't going to do that so I told him I would drive around again even though it was completely unnecessary. So I got my food and went around again (still no cars had been through the drive thru) and ordered a single coke. Not even food which made it more annoying. But anyways. So we got to the window and wanted to get more fries because they gave me a super small amount in my meal but we weren't gonna complain because we were already over this experience. So we were just gonna buy them. And so we asked if we could add on fries and she said no!! She literally said ""uhmmmmmm no"". And I was speechless. Needless to say. Screw them."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I ordered the chicken strips and a couple hours later had the worst pain I've ever felt in my stomach. Didn't sleep much and the pain was so bad that I was close to going to the ER. Not sure if it was what I ate here, but it was the only thing I had eaten recently and the pain started immediately after! Not going to any Jack In the Box again. I don't trust that the food is sanitary."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I eat a lot of fast food and this is not a top choice. The automated order machine was broken and it couldn't accept cash for payment so to the long line I go. Like my previous visit the order was wrong on more than one item including a ""no tomato"" burger having a big juicy red slice. 

The order had taken nearly 15 minutes to be prepared and the two of us came during non peak hours. We swear never to return"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Terrible. Wish I could give it zero stars. Ignorant worker wouldn't let me make multiple orders at the drive thru. Waste of time
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Yeah not much to say about since its a typical fast food joint that has a pretty big variety. We've all seen the commercials...

The only thing I really have to say about this location is be careful when going through the drivethru at night. It happens every time I go. They always forget something in my order. Usually its just an item or some sauces that we asked for that they forgot to put in. Other times they give just one ketchup packet for a large order. We've had whole meals missing. Instead of a large curly fries we've gotten a small order of regular fries before. I think the worst one ever was a jumbo jack with cheese, but there was no meat patty. (some how jumbo jack with cheese was turned into a grilled cheese) Yeah that one sucked because we checked the bag before leaving."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"This JB was at the top of my list for the fast food place to go. Whether it be getting it for lunch during my high school days or grabbing it on late nights. It's your regular fast food place with a decent amount of options. They have really good sides and I can't get enough of their jalapeno poppers. The mini churros aren't bad either. You are going to feel it in the morning, but it felt so worth it at the time. I will always have a place in my heart (or artery)  for you Jack in the Box."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Rude service. Arrived with friend both of us had coupons ...woman behind counter said only one of us could use because we walked in together we were counted as 1 guest. Tried to ask questions she ignores us talking and clowning around with co workers. Very rude to us and people behind us. Then to round it off slide bolt breaking in bathroom locked in for 5 minutes before I could get it unlocked. No thank you.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Worst Jack in the box ever! I had ordered a Jack's Spicy Chicken sandwich with cheese and an order of tacos (2) & when I was given the food I asked the guy to confirm that the sandwich had cheese and he said ""yes""! Then, when I got home to eat it, guess what -- no frickin' cheese!!!! Complete losers and the worst customer service ever!! I am definitely gonna complain first thing in the morning."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,the people who work here are incompetent beyond belief. they constantly get orders wrong and never in a good way (such as giving you an extra  burger  or fries you didnt order). the last straw for me was two days ago when they not only gave me the wrong burger when i only ordered two items but gave me the worst case of food poisoning i've ever had. needless to say i reported them to public health and would warn everyone to stay away from this place. if someone reported them to corporate i'm sure they would shut them down or change management.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,positive,"i had to review this place just because it is a frequent stop for late night munchies with friends. Their drive through is open very late (or maybe even all night, im not sure). I was not at all a fan of jack and the box before, but their sirloin burgers and curly fries are actually pretty delicious."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I think this place is going out of business, they didn't have any soda, ranch, or curly fries when I went in. Guess they're having a close out sale?"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,The absolute WORST jack in the box I have ever been to. The person working there was rude and it took 20 minutes to get a milkshake in the drive through.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,positive,"For all the years I've been in Goleta, this place has never failed me.

LOVE coming by for the 2 tacos for only 99cents. Where else can you get that? Load it up with sauce and I'm all good! What can I say? Broke college student.

Even now, after college...I can't help but come back and check out the value menu. See what's changed, what hasn't...

My current obsession: I love their mini churros. They are filled with some sweet cinnamon sauce that just oozes out as you bite it. Dip it into their oreo milkshake and you are all set!

Extra star for the nicest woman (Hannah? Anna?) I have ever heard at any drive-thru ever! She was loud and clear and just perfect! Not like those people you get that you can barely hear and they just mumble and sound miserable. She was excellent!"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"15 minute wait in the drive thru.  Unacceptable by any standards.  The lady at the window claim she's on her own and that's the reason for the delay.  

Jack in the box has great commercials but horrible customer service."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Since everyone know's how a jack in the box is like (fast food, burgers, fried stuffs, etc) i just want to reiterate how great 24 hour drive thrus are!!! 

and friendly service who love to give me extra sauce and goods!"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Just ordered from the last night mash up munchies menu- ordered the buffalo chicken hashbrowns and they looked nothing like the advertised item. It was basically chicken nuggets on top of a hash brown with a ton of ranch and melted cheese with on top. Everything I've ever ordered at any jack in the box has been pretty gross other tran their curly fries. 
seriously how do you mess up a simple breakfast burrito? 
I would show a picture of the food I just received but honestly I'm afraid it would make people gag too much."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"This place sucks.  I recently got a job in the area a month ago and there are several options for lunch so I've only been here 3 times.  First trip I ordered a bacon ultimate cheeseburger. I get back to work. They gave me a homestyle ranch chicken club. I couldn't go back so I decided I would just eat it.  The chicken was kinda like rubber. I ate less than half then decided to call jack to bitch and complain. They sent me a free combo. 
 Second visit I order a buttery jack combo. At least it was free. Cold and wasn't anything special. 
Third visit I decided I'll order 6 tacos. I  know they are not great and I honestly have no clue what that meat is, but it's kind of like there are certain versions of food that you know what to expect and the tacos at jack in the box are just that. They are the bottom end of tacos but I like them occasionally and you get 2 for $1.29, so not much to complain about. The only problem is I get back to work and there are only 4 levels in the bag. 
 The guy who took my order and gave me my food is dressed as I figure the manager would be, yet he looked in my bag to put 4 sauces in with what should be 6 tacos."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,This jack in the box is awful! They always get your order wrong and the soda machine taste like mineral water
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"The food was disgusting. Yes, I know, what would I expect from a fast food place.  But this was the worse of the worse. I ordered a chicken salad and the chicken was basically eating rubber. I went back another time, cause I was in a hurry and it's the only drive through in the area. Had a chicken salad, same result. I give up on that place, I'll starve before I go back there."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Worst tacos everrr!!!! They are always a hit or miss when you go through the drive-thru. I just had to yelp about how horrible these 99 cent tacos were. I shoulda known better and checked them out before I drove away. They looked like they had been put in the fryer 5x no lie! Thank goodness they were only .99 cents but still if I could have gone back to complain in person I would have but Ain't Nobody Got Time Fo Dat!! My curly fries were fresh so at least I was able to eat those. Rule of thumb ""Always check your food"" before u leave JITB! No wonder I hardly eat there."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Talk about slow..this place is slower than slow. The employees just seem to fool around all the time and its pretty annoying seeing them fool around while you're waiting for your order. I have 30min for lunch and I work right next to this place and about time I get my food 15mins has already past. It's sad because its the only place open at the time I go to lunch
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"When I was getting my nails did in walking distance at Famous Nails yesterday the ladies that were working got a snack at Jack's... totally brought back memories from when I used to have the munchies and was at FT (Fuck Towers now Santa Catalina Dorms) or when I was filling up my gas next door at Chevron and skipped over for a Spicy Chicken Sando (those are the best!).

Hot, quick and greasy... what more could one ask for (question mark)."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Worst J of B experience. Came to eat but bathrooms had such a foul odor (sewer gas?) I'm still nauseated. 3 dried out Airwick sanitizers each in both men's and women's bathrooms could not mask the  stench. Ordered the salad with chicken, but lettuce is wilted and only two pieces of chicken (skimpy compared to other JB franchises I've ordered at). Thurs July 23, 1pm."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Came in after 9pm for their munchie meal but was charged regular price! After I pointed it out to them on the receipt they told me they couldn't rufund me the money because the machine automatically charges it. Doesn't make sense at all.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I know this is fast food and expectations should never be high for fast food but this might possibly be the worst Jack in the Box ever. I've waited in line at the drive-thru for extended periods of time and not complained because it's the closest option available. What really pushed me over the edge though was waiting in line for 35 minutes only to find out that there was one worker handling both register and food due to a shortage of employees. All in all it took me 45 minutes to get a Munchie Meal. Now I blame myself for waiting in line and being a jackass but this has forever effected my desire to go to Jack In The Box. I decided to even give it another shot after that experience and it was shame on me. After 15 minutes of waiting on the cashier to help me, I simply asked ""how much longer til we get helped?"" (There was another gentleman waiting inside with me) The worker looks at me and says ""if you don't want to wait you can leave."" He must have helped 6 or 7 cars in the drive thru before even acknowledging there were customers inside. Mind you there was only 3 cars in the drive thru when I walked in. Never again!"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Just stopped for a quick lunch on our way elsewhere up the coast. Not busy at all.  Guy mopping floor.  Hubby and I stopped in the bathrooms first but women's had no soap.  Reported it to cashier but nothing was done about it during our stay.  I went into men's to wash my hands. Lunch order was screwed up as well. This joint should be avoided for sanitation as well as competence. Terrible.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Got my order wrong the past 3 times Ive gone there which means 100% of the time. It's really not that hard. I don't know why they mess up each and every time.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"The customer service is beyond unacceptable. There were only seven people in the restaurant so I thought it was nothing out of the ordinary when they did not hand me a receipt. I waited roughly 15 minutes just for one order of jalapeno poppers. After they called my order, they asked me for my receipt which I clearly did not have because I was never handed one. The manager then dares rolls his eyes at me and grabs the order and puts it back in the kitchen without saying a word. I sternly told him I wanted my order or my money back. He then replies in a cocky manner that I do not need to raise my voice. If this is the type of worker Jack In the Box promotes to a manager position, I hope this company fails."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I ordered the breakfast platter before driving up north for 4 hours. I also ordered a glass of water. They rushed me off the line in the drive through without giving me my water. When I looked in my bag later, I noticed there was no syrup, or butter for my pancakes. I can't eat this bland meal without dressing. I just wasted my money on this place. 'Never going back there again."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"The service is usually terrible and the drive-thru is always painfully slow. There aren't many drive-thrus around and Jack's being one of the few places that actually has one is just terrible. Once, when I finally got up to the window after soooo long , my boyfriend and I, clearly heard the woman behind the window telling her co-worker ""If they wait, they wait"", with a very apathetic look and tone in her voice. I was just baffled and how unconcerned the staff was about how long they were taking. 
Regardless, I still come here every once in a while because the food is usually pretty good, I haven't had a bad experience with the food."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,The night shift management needs an overhaul . Super rude to people on Sunday 7/22 you could tell she was busy and frustrated with the ammount of people walking through the door . If you dislike your job than move on.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"The coupons that come in the mail make us want to indulge in greasy fast food from Jack in the Box.  Nothing too special, your typical fatty foods. 

I never leave this place without curly fries.  That's probably the only thing I get here.  

Denver breakfast bowl is pretty good...with a coupon.  Jack's spicy chicken sandwich is always a safe choice."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,positive,Stephanie was working the drive-thru when I stopped by for lunch on my overnight shift and she has a lot of positive energy that most people I see on my breaks overnight don't come close to matching. It was refreshing and she is great at her job.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"The drive-thru employees suck!!! THey have the audacity to try and tell you how to order food, however, they constantly interrupt you as you order."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,positive,"Went on a business trip to UCSBA

every visit was pleasant and my order was right all the time.

I know fast food isn't always right but thank you guys for the great service!  especially late :)"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"J-bo's, the best place to get drunk food after a night in IV. It is also the hardest, seeing as you have to have a DD to get there (if you don't feel like dying). The service here is great, and, unlike many a college-town restaurant, they don't charge extra for more ranch or ""house special"" sauce. I hate it when places do that.

Good job J-bo's; fattening up the country, one college kid at a time."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Very FILTHY!!!!!! Horrible customer service! All their junk and cleaners and dirty towel with dirty water on the counters and they places my food right next to it.. dear lord.. have someone fire the people working here and hire better management! I hope they close down....
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Everything about this place is dull. The food, the restaurant, the workers. Honestly prefer going to the McDonald's across the street for your fast-food fix."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I am not sure what it is about this location, but having to wait about 10 minutes in a drive threw is ridiculous. This is mostly a weekly thing here. Seriously, who manages this place in the morning?"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Pretty darn disappointed with JITB today. I went and ordered 2 number 8's with curly fires and a number 15 chicken bowl. The guy at the window asked if I wanted catsup, to which I replied yes however I ended up with a bag full of hot sauce. I had to ask for two more straws. I get home and find that they did not give my me curly fires, and no sauce for the egg roll. My bacon potato wedges had a TINY bit of cheese on them. 

Seems like they were training someone new and he did a terrible job on my order. When I called to complain and they suggested I come back to get a cash refund when I had paid with a credit card. Annoying and inconvenient.

The only saving grace was my chicken bowl. It was quite tasty.

I don't expect much from a fast food joint, but I expect them to do their job and get my order right. Thats not much to ask right?"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Quite literally the worst fast food in town. I only come here on my overnight shifts sometimes because there's no where else if I don't bring lunch. The service is less than abysmal, the workers couldn't even be bothered to fake their energy let alone give any sort of care or service. Avoid like the plague"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Was in the area but was not being too adventurous so I went here. I ordered the Ranch Chicken sandwich combo. The chicken was fried with ranch dressing, lettuce, cheese, and tomato all inside the bun. All in all, it was okay. My only complaint was the fries were cold."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Absolutely disgusting service. Look what they served me when i asked for jumbo cheeseburger wo the cheese and pickles... just the bun and patty lol! I expected tomatoes and lettuce per the picture
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"SAVE YOUR SELF THE TRIP HERE BECUASE THEY SUCK! 

I lived in a few towns here locally and have trieds several different jack in the cracks, they are my favorite but this one should even be called Jacks. It actully made me change my prefference to Carls jr. I love the tacos but dont go here for them unless you want to be grossed out. Ever time I think service here might have gotten better I always end up dissapointed. I love jacks tacos, just not from this jack in the box. to top if dont complain to those that work their unless you want to be looked at funny or have a worker try and defend themselves like your attacking them. Im just letting you know no need to get all defensive, just fix the issue.

I decided to complained to corporate about there refired tacos and how thier service was horrible. it has happened one to many times, im just fed up with them. The tacos stale and dark brown, not sure if its the oil or they just over cooking them or what ever the issue is but they are not suppose to be like that. icing on the cake, they even forgot to put my chicken sandwhich in the bag and my jalepeno poppers. ok, my mistake for not checking the bag, but that shouldnt be my job. I should get discounted price if i need to check the bag thats like half the work.

When I called corporate they sent me one coupon for my item two weeks later. I was like wow great im going to go back for my combo meal that I order, nope i was mistaken. the manager said it was one only for one item WTF MATE i paid 7 buicks for a spicy chiken combo and you give me a voucher for an item that wont cost over $3.50?. How to they expect to keep my business if they only give me a voucer for one item when my whole meal was ruined becuase I had to go back and forth to pick up the items they forget. gas is not cheap in SB and thats taking time out of my day for a lame inconvience.  

Oh and another thing NAT FLIES by the drinking area is gross. I think the only reason why this location stays open is becuase the college kids dont care, they go in drunk on a late night and keep this shameful bussiness going... Im writing a formal compliant to the heath inspector, lets see if that changes anything. New management or workers? Yes, Please either will be fine!!!!!"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I usually enjoy jack in the box and everything it has to offer including its customer service but today was just not a good day for them, I'm a consistent customer at this Hollister location  but today there was a Bald headed person at the register that I assume was a manager because he had a supervisor/manager uniform, I would assume as well that he'd have good customer service. Right when I got there I asked for the bathroom password and it seemed like he wasn't to happy to be there he had a mean mugging look and seemed like he was pissed at everybody I hope he realizes customers are the reason he gets a paycheck, we aren't his enemy. I then got my combo and asked for 3 sauces and he said nope you only get 2 it's only a combo. Keep in mind it was a large combo as well.I've never had this happen to me and I'm determined to never come to this location specifically for his customer service. I've never had this problem anywhere else but regardless some people put more sauce on their combo, 3 isn't a crazy number either."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Husband and I stopped in here the other night because it was late, we were hungry and they were convenient.  Ordered a golden oreo shake and some churro bites.  Asked to use the bathroom and the men's room was not available but men could use the family restroom (the only one with a door wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs too).  The women's was available and we were given the 4-digit codes by an employee I had a slight hard time hearing so I had to ask her to repeat the code 3 or 4 times before I could remember it.  Super awkward and inconvenient.  Women's restroom was not very clean and super narrow.  

Golden Oreo shake wasn't blended quite enough - the cookie pieces could only be sucked through the straw with professional strength.  Need wider straws if you're going to make them like this.  Otherwise food was tasty.  Location convenient and open late.  ""Meh, I've experienced better"" sums it up nicely."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"We were on the road and made a quick stop. Saw that the croissants were 2 for $4. Told the cashier I wanted 5 supreme and 1 sausage when I finished ordering she repeated back and told me 4supreme. I corrected her, common mistake it was okay. When I checked my receipt she didn't give me the 2 for 4 I told her and she got all pissy and made another lady give me my money. I understand it was a mistake but why did she get mad at me? I wasn't even rude about it.."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Terrible service even for a fast food restaurant. I used my Lakers' voucher for two free tacos, and the staff had a hard time processing the order. Even once they cleared up the order, the female coworker gave no word about the order. A tray was simply sitting in front of me with a taco waiting on it while I waited for them all to be ready. 

The inside feels cramped, dim, and uninviting.

Lastly, my taco didn't look too far different from the one that Angela R photographed - brown and over-fried.

I won't go inside this Jack in the Box again."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I've only came here on desperate late night munchies or just grabbing a quick bite to eat with friends. 

Window service is a hit or miss because they do mess up an orders frequently but it is what it is."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"If I can put 0 stars I would ! LOOK AT THIS BURNT PIECE OF CRAP ! My BF went to get some food here  this morning & at one point they all left the kitchen to the back ! Rude as people ! , what kinda service is this ! Seriously get new employees Get A new Manager ! You guys have low rating as it is ! so embarrassing! Have some pride in your work ! Might not be the best but still do your job right for people like us who pay for our meal !"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Horrible service. Says they're open 24 hours, but I've went multiple times and they have been closed by 10 PM due to being ""understaffed."" Avoid this place!"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,If I could leave a worse review I would we ended up driving away without anything because we wanted a coke and fries THATS IT. She wanted 4 dollars then 5 dollars then 7 dollars then asked for another dollar I have no idea what the f$&@ that was but we will NEVER go to any jack in the box again because this was insane. We drove off and left the money because it was so crazy we just wanted to get away from this person. Unbelievable
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Stopped here because it was the first and pretty much only fast food option on our road trip for miles. Service was lukewarm, their soda machine had no ice, but restrooms (for customers only!) were decent. Served its purpose for a quick snack and bathroom break but if you can wait."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I went here at 4am and had a really simple order. I wanted a plain cheeseburger combo. I specified just meat, cheese, and bun. It took the gal working the drive thru literally over 5 minutes to grasp this concept. It was the weirdest exchange I've ever had at a drive thru. Then, on top of that, the food is just super bland. I don't remember other Jack In The Box locations being this bad, although I don't really eat here much to begin with. Also, I can't stand when you order a drink and 90% of it is ice. The curly fries amount I got is very small too. I maybe have like 10 curly fries. I ended the order by being very polite and understanding as I don't like to judge the individual worker too hard, but overall, it was just a very subpar experience."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Fucking awful service. Went through the drive through the other night and waited in line for an hour before even getting our food and then the cashier was rude and barely gave us any service at all. I understand working at a fast food joint. But to have shit service and fucking making customers wait on your rudeness is unacceptable.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Anastacia was so rude that I am left in disbelief. I never take the time to review a place because I'm a student and am busy, but this was so bad that I have to say something. Seriously that girl should be fired. I wanted sweet tea, she gave me unsweetened. I said sorry, but can I have a pink lemonade instead because the tea is not sweet. She then gave me the silent treatment, even after I said thank you. She had trouble putting a lid on the drink and threw it aggressively. Honestly just awful service. I called them three times wanting to tell a manager but nobody answered the phone."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Been here a few times and I've always been disappointed. The food is alright, tacos are horrible, especially the service. Rude employees, always complaining with bad attitudes. This place seriously needs to fire employees or retrain them."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I ordered a Large water cup because I was dehydrated. The lady said she has to charge for the cup which is fine with me. I was expecting to pay 50 cents for a water cup but the lady charges $3.09 for a cup of water. That is more expensive than the Bottled Water that they sell. Not sure why the lady wanted to charge me so much money for WATER. 
Also Ordered the new Double cheese burger combo for 5.99 and the quality was bad, had to throw the food in the garbage after 3 bites. 
No more Jack N Box for me ever again."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"The service at this Jack in the box is absolutely awful. It's the closest place to eat from my work so I stop by when I don't feel like making a lunch, several times I've been standing at the counter waiting for someone to take my order, they see me standing there but continue their own personal conversations. Today while waiting in line, 4 other people were ahead of me, they had 1 register open, an employee came up, did something on the second register, looked at all of us in line and just walked away to do anything other than take orders. If this location had better service, I'd give it more stars but I can't bring myself to to give them anything more than 2 stars."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"They forgot half my order and did not give me a receipt. For me to get a refund I need to drive to ANOTHER CITY to get my money back. For some reason manager can't refund remotely. Unacceptable, avoid this location. I don't have time to be driving to a city I don't live in to get my money back, so I hope you use the $10 that was stolen from me to hire more employees and train them better so they don't miss half of an order."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I generally think of this place as not the lowest quality burger place but this time it is. Worst than McDonalds! The restaurant was poorly kept, very dirty, they were out of fries and it took forever to get our order in! Sorry but just being honest."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Worst customer service ever experienced from a fast food employee especially from the manager running the drive-through window. He seemed to not clear about customers and quite frankly very rude and impolite.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,The worker there was a complete fucking bitch. She should be fired immediately. She was younger and gave me the biggest attitude. Fire her now!
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Went in there and this bald headed goatee wearing  takuache looking ass manager had the worst attitude and the worst customer service ever. Why be at a place were you look like you hate your job?! just quit bro!
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Disgusting. You don't need to spend your money here, and it was the wrong order. The cashier lady named Lorena at the drive thru had an overall bitter attitude and was rushing to get us out and put chicken in my friends teriyaki bowl when she asked for no chicken because she's VEGAN and she gave me the wrong burger. Instead it was a chick n' tater melt which is a breakfast option but I ordered the curly fry burger. 

Try McDonald's across the street for better quality and service 

Not this shithole"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Fuck jack in the box I waiting a whole hour to get my food to order I had to wait 10 minuets to order the food was raw I suggest to close this place down or have health inspection check this place out.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,If there's no one in the drive-through lane and I'm staying here for at least 5 to 10 minutes without being the help and they say it's open how is that possible and it's not the first time I come around 430 and it's the same service either takes 45 minutes to get my meal or it takes me about 20 minutes to get help. Worst Jack-in-the-Box
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Really bad costumer service at this place at this time feb 25/2021 11:00pm  the girl that took our order first very rude like wut else...  almost like I don't want to be here wtf you want ! ? You know ! But guess what ?! You working in a restaurant so you have to deal with and be nice to people !! Dude do your job that pays you'r bills ! And stupid shit you buy and if you don't have a good costumer service you are in the wrong job ! You need to  get trained or look for a new job like in a small office by yourself just saying because your costumers are hungry and want fresh food I love jalapeño poppers !! That's why I love jack !! But seriously guys don't apply if you don't have costumer service ! Stay home and don't be miserable in life w others !
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I normally like Jack in the Box in a pinch, but this location is horrible!' The food occasionally gets messed up (which sucks during COVID bc you can't immediately get it resolved like you could if you ate there), but a few screw-ups are to be expected in any food establishments. What makes this place horrible is the ""service."" This isn't the first time an employee at this location lacked civility, but the employee working the drive-through on a recent Thursday night took the cake. Not just bad service, she SCREAMED at my 70 year old mother, and told her to get out of line bc the employee couldn't find our order number, which we read off to her. TO GO WHERE?!?? They locked the doors (at 8:00 at night)! We used the app and had an order number. She absolutely refused to even look at our order number. We left, and went to Deja Vu.

I've worked at the lowest levels of fast food, to actually owning a fast food place here in SB for nearly a decade. I am definitely NOT a ""the customer is always right"" type of person. And I definitely understand that you never know what someone is going through, so I could just chalk it up to a bad day. 

But this was so over the top ... (and, as I said, other employees have acted similarly, just not this extreme).


TO THE MANAGER/OWNER: what's worse than having this employee(s)? Knowing full well you have problems (judging by the Yelp reviews, this isn't the first time someone complained), and you have chosen to do nothing about it. You either don't read the reviews, or you don't care, and I don't know what frustrates me more.

The next day, I just really wanted another burger after melanoma surgery. Yep, we got on the freeway to Carl's Jr., even though Jack in the Box is literally a two minute commute from my front door if you hit every red light.

This location isn't bad per se; it's just in need of entirely new management."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,positive,It's really better than 1.5 stars. It's a j-box. It's just cold in there all the time.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I went to one of the few games the Lakers have won while holding their opponent to under 100 points. What does that even mean? 
FREE TACOS FOR ME

Truth be told that's the only reason I came here. It look like five minutes to ring up the free tacos. I wish I was kidding but that's literally five minutes. 

Not one apology or anything. Go back to customer service 101 and learn something."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,onight I ordered the chick-n-tater melt and it tasted as though it was dipped in soap before served. Probably the worse experience I've ever had at a jack in the box. Would've waited extra time for my meal to be made correctly.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Forgot fries and a straw for my milkshake and I had a long drive ahead. Absolutely unacceptable
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Rude service! Will not be revisiting. Guy working the morning shift complained to us that his coworkers came in late and left him to do all the work. Who cares? If you're getting paid to work, work! He did not say a single thank you. The fries are good tho :)"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,Literally asked for 2-3 ranches and the guy gave me ketchup instead. It was obvious he did not enjoy working there. poor customer service per usual.
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"We were told that they're out of butter, after we received our pancakes! No communication @ all! She should have informed us before we ordered the pancakes regarding the butter.

Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"No problem

I hate it when I tell the clerk ""thank you"" and they reply ""no problem""



Food is from Jack in the Box

At least when I gave them $20.07 for my $4.07 total, the guy gave me $16.07 change then wanted to argue that it was not $16.00 change I was owed. 

You got to laugh."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"After waiting 23 minutes behind 5 cars just to order food in the drive thru line, I'm not sure how anything can possible take this long to hold up a line this long. Orders can't be customized that extensively for burgers, tacos and fries. Fast food now takes as long as a sit down dining experience? Food isn't amazing, unless you want fake meat tacos go to McDonalds across the street!"
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,positive,"This jack in the box really doesn't deserve the low rating. I mean, it's a jack in the box. I've been here more times than I'd like to admit, but I always have a nice experience. Employees are friendly, and they're always there for me when I need a grilled cheese and curly fries at midnight. I owe them a great deal really. In fact, my friend and I drove to Spudnuts for donuts one night, and they were closed, and we were devastated. HOWEVER, Jack in the box came to the rescue with their donut holes. I'd recommend them any day! PRO TIP: dip your grilled cheese in ketchup and ranch. You're welcome."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"I've been coming to this place for late night snacks for years now. I love their food. But I decided to not be their customer anymore. Here is the reason.

On May 18,2019, at about 1:30am, I went to the drive-thru to get some food for me and my girlfriend. I ordered, a large teriyaki bowl with 3 egg rolls, and a 5 piece homestyle chicken strips with large fries. I got the order, and trusting them to have done the work correctly, I didnt check the bag. Yet when I got back home, I realized that there was only one egg roll, and after eating one of the chicken strips, my gf noticed it was spicy.

Apparently they got the order wrong. Missing 2 egg rolls, and having the spicy chicken strips instead of home style ones, I drove back to the location (obviously upset). 

I entered the dining room, and waited by the counter until one of their workers came by. I told him that they had my order wrong and asked if they could check my order. Obviously I was quite upset, and was not in the best mood. Yet, I believe I still behaved politely in the situation.
However, because I had not bring the order back with me (it was with my gf, and honestly, I expected them have the customer service to own their mistakes and just make the new one for me.) the person i mention earlier said "" but you can't prove it though"" (with the most unconcerned, and unprofessional attitude ever)

At that point, I was just shocked and mad. As for me, the manner of which he said it, implied that either I was lying, or that they just didn't care and did not want to own their mistake. So I went back and grabbed my order, and went back to the store. This time I was furious, but I did not raise my voice, until the person (mentioned earlier) walk up and seemed as if he was going to punch me in the face and started to yell at me saying that I was going at him the entire time. So I started to argue with him, which was uncivilized of both of us. (I'm not ashamed, I deserve to be treated as a paying customer, and they needed to own their mistake, not fight with the customer)

Tbh, I couldn't care less about him. I just wanted my order. I don't know him, and would not randomly attack anybody. They were busy, and I would guess that the guy had a bad day. Yet, being busy does not justify a wrong order. Having a bad day, does not mean you can yell at a customer. Simply saying, ""would you mind bringing back your order so we could verify it please."" Would be better than saying "" ""you can't prove it though"""
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Jack in the box had the worst service tonight. We walked in and waited 5 minutes until we were attended three employees just stared at us as we waited for the cashier. The cashier that stepped in to help us put his cell phone and earphones away and didn't wash his hands. He had no name tag and was not pleased to assist us. We ordered and paid, and he proceeded to handle food without washing his hands. I watched him the whole time as we waited for our food. All the tables were dirty. We cleaned it ourselves and attempted to wash our hands. We need a code, and nobody was at the counter to provide us with it."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,negative,"Probably the worst Jack I've ever been to, and I've been to pretty terrible ones (I.e., the one on state... I've encountered the employee talk smack about the customer in front of me... to me). Slowest service, and the employee who is working right now took forever to tell me the options for the late night munchie meal. Honestly, there were only 3 cars in front of me, but I could have probably taken a nap in line and still woken up before my food was handed to me.

I'll probably ban myself from coming here. It's a shame that they can be doing so much better and have a quicker night... but I guess the employees here don't care about their customers or their productivity."
Wy8Hswf2cLQGRZN6armkag,Jack in the Box,Mexican,positive,"Just writing this review and thinking about this place is making my mouth water. Everything I have ever ordered from here is a hot, greasy, salty mess...and I damn well love it. People at the window are always chipper and one even gave my dog some bacon when he (the dog) stuck his head out the window. Great way to get a week's worth of calories in one meal. One time I saw someone holding up a sign asking for money arguing with the person in the car in front of me."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,New owners turned it into a double threat: Bad food AND bad service. Shame. I loved this place.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Hi there!! I highly recommend this restaurant food is so good especially the chicken is the bomb...
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,This place is where the former Pollo Loco used to be next to the launder-mat. I'm always in search of the best breakfast burrito and this place has it. Delicious homemade flour tortillas made daily along with a fresh salsa bar with 4 different salsas to choose from. They offer daily specials too! I'll definitely be back for lunch & dinner.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Love this place. 
Best chicken and tri tip. All Mexican goodies to eat. Great service."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Bummed to see a few only OK reviews for this place! We love it. My opinion: best all around Mexican BBQ in Goleta- better than Chicken Ranch, MUCH better than Pollofino. I recommend getting the special burrito, wet; both green and red sauces are good, but I prefer red. The combo meal satisfies too. Well-seasoned tri-tip (occasionally a bit tough) and chicken. I really like their salsa bar, but the salsas they have mostly aren't chip-dipping salsas like I think many people expect (they're primarily chili-based taco and burrito salsas; not tomato-based chip salsas). But get a couple of each and pour em over the wet burrito. I can't attest to the tacos, but my partner's had them and thinks they're solid, but not Lily's-level great."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This place as a local feel to it. Food is legit. I ordered the flautas, chile relleno, and the tacos. Prices are cheap, food is pretty authentic. It definitely compares to food that I've had in Mexico. Unfortunately, they ran out of chicken when I was there so I didn't get a chance to try it. The place is worth checking out."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Delicious and flavorful food at a fair price. It's a little odd being next to a laundromat, but hole in the wall places like this often have food that exceeds expectations.

The sitting area is pretty bare bones, but there's everything you need for a great dining experience - amazing food, fast service, a big bucket of beers, and sports on the TV.

When you're in the area, don't pass this hidden gem up.  You won't be disappointed!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,It was a pleasant surprise walking into this restaurant from the customer service to the food. If you're ever staying at the Hampton Inns and looking for great tasting Mexican food at walking distance check out El Pollo RICO. I ordered 1/4 of chicken plate and my boyfriend ordered the 1/4 combo chicken with tri-Tip we left with happy belly's. The salsa bar also carries a variety of authentic salsas from mild to hot. Enjoy!!
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Excellent food and exceptionally good choice of salsas. The picked onions are truly rico.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Food is excellent if you have ever visited authentic non commercial Mexican restaurants. Staff is friendly and a good variety on the menu. Prices was fair and portion was generous

6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"OK, I think I'll come ... like again and again!  Authentic and muy delisio!  Had the chimichanga and loved it. Place was spotless with very friendly staff."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"I was delighted to find a good Mexican-style chicken place that's better than the chains in town.  The chicken is great, and the skin is perfectly crispy.  The salsa is good, and the corn tortillas are fantastic.  Very reasonably priced.

For what it is -- a quick Mexican-style chicken place -- it's almost perfect.  I only docked one star for the useless plastic cutlery."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"I was leaning more toward 3.5 stars but the menudo sent it over to 4. I ordered menudo and chicken taquitos. Taquitos were okay, menudo I really enjoyed. Didn't have hominy but had a good amount of meat!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"I've often joked how I was going to book a vacation based upon the places Marc D. has visited.

Imagine my surprise when bored during a meeting at UCSB, and tired of listening to my stomach, decided to see where I could get a taco near campus and guess who's review pops up??

I wasn't sure what to think knowing this was basically part of a laundromat but knowing I've eaten in odder places, wrapped the meeting up and got on my way.

Right off the street on Hollister (and very freeway adjacent) there is both lot and street parking; I was there mid-afternoon so finding a spot was super easy.

With lots of options from standard Mexican food to a guacamole bacon burger, stayed with my original vision and order up two chicken and two tri tip tacos. As I was the only person in the restaurant at the time, the service attention was all on me with my tacos cooked up quickly and with a smile.

The chicken was beyond amazing with the perfect amount of flavoring and just off the grill. The tri tip was more of a well done than on the rarer side which caused it to slightly loose some flavor. Not bad but could have been just a little bit better with a few minutes on the grill. I'll gladly trade some char for juice. Both are topped with onions and cilantro with lots of salsa options for extra flavoring.

The restaurant, including the bathrooms, are spotless which doesn't mean much if you're taking it to go but would certainly enjoy my meal with a cold one there next time.

And there will be a next time!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Surprisingly delicious!  My friend and I were on the way to the drive in theater and wanted to pick up food on the way.  We were running late and saw El Pollo Rico, which looked a little sketchy but we decided to try it anyway.

I ordered the posole soup and it was really good.  The toppings were fresh and the soup was flavorful and some of the best I've had before.  Their chips were also really good, warm and fresh.  My friend got the nachos and they were good too with lots of toppings.  The salsa was really good, and the only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the guacamole which was pretty average.

It was fast and cheap and had great food.  I would definitely go back, but only for take out because the atmosphere next to the laundromat is pretty dismal."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Really enjoy this place! Great veggie burrito, special burrito was awesome too. I like the toppings, sides and salsa they offer and I like how the burrito comes with chips too!"

6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"so we've been here a few more times since my last review, & i'm disappointed to say that after our last time we WILL NOT ever be coming back.

my first two chimichangas were great (like in my first review) but the next one was disgustingly soggy... so oily that it was leaking in the container. since then i've tried the VEGGIE fajitas burrito, which really unfortunately had some accidental chunks of meat in it, & their veggie nachos which were bland.

my boyfriend orders their special burrito (which is supposed to have everything on it) but the past 2 times they made it a regular & still charge for the special. the lady taking orders can't really understand English, but the worst part is that once she understands what you're trying to say, she'll forget the order. our last time there i had her repeat the order twice on the phone to confirm that she got it right, then once more when we went to pick it up, & the order ended up still being wrong.

the food is prepared sloppily & getting the correct order/price is a hassle. not gonna be spending any more money here."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Awesome spot. Great food and everyone working is super friendly. I recommend the chili verde burrito.

Plate of Chile Verde with rice and beans and fresh tortilla.

Pastor Taco. 
$12
Oh, and they had guac at the salsa bar. 
Place is always empty but they make some real good food."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"I've been going here for a good while. My most recent trip was really bad tho. Lately each time I go the sodas always taste flat with no flavor. The food arrives fairly quick to the table. I typically order a burrito. This time I ordered the convo burrito. And the meat was very salty, accompanied by the salty beans too. It was pretty tough to eat. They also messed up my brothers order by giving him some other meal instead of the one he got. But on the real the food here has gotten worse throughout there years ):"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This is one good Mexican food. I'm originally from LA so i know whats good. This place has some good cheese tacos. they also have salsa bar, so fill your salsa vergde and the green one as much as you want. workers were nice and nice service"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,Went to eat here and workers had door open with music going having their own party but said they closed at 9pm!!!! Yelp says they were open until 11pm!!!!!
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Really superb chicken burrito. Inexpensive, large selection, and delicious. What's not to love?"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Wow!! It's really all I can say - I had the chicken soft tacos and the tri-tip nachos.  Of course I didn't eat all of it - I took the nachos for next days lunch! YES - next days lunch.  Love the atmosphere, the flavors, and the freshness of the meat.  Wishing I could take this back to Vegas with me, but I am here for 10 more days!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,From the outside it does not look like much however the place blew me away With an amazing atmosphere people sitting around watching soccer and the best Mexican food I have had in a long time.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"Mehh.. I was hoping for something better...

The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  We decided to visit this place tonight since we were up in Goleta for the night and based on the reviews I thought it would be good place to eat.

Well we ate ;) but as far was leaving us with the desire to ever go back? Nope.

The tri-tip is very thin and overly salted, the horchata was just from a mix so not satisfying at all.

They have a decent salsa bar but the chips are not free.

So if you are looking for a just-ok Mexican place then give this place a try."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Very, very good. Tasty marinated meats. Nicely grilled peppers and tortillas. A chill authentic vibe at the restaurant. Always fast, friendly and tasty."

6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"* The name doesn't lie! *

You've just got to love a laundromat that offers Mexican food while you wait.  I didn't have any laundry to do, but got drawn in by the huge sign reading, ""BBQ Chicken and Tri-tip.""  I figured I might be in for a real treat with Mexican style BBQ chicken and some good beef!  And I was not disappointed!

Inside the restaurant portion has the feel of a fast food spot combined with a neighbourhood hangout.  Some people were trying to watch CNN on one of the overhead TVs, but I have no idea how as Mexican music was also playing over the sound system.

Spotted one person on their laptop using the free wifi as well.

In any case, on to the food....

The chicken was really nicely seasoned, had crispy skin, yet still had amazingly moist meat inside.  Delicious!  

The tri-tips were also well marinated and had a nice char.  They were a bit too cooked for my taste, but I don't think anybody would call them overcooked.  I just like my beef a bit more towards the rare side of things.  

They offered a variety of salsas.  The green was my favourite as it had a nice balance and slightly more complex flavour profile.  

But as the name of the place suggests, the chicken is definitely the highlight here!  

And the bonus is that if you drip something on your shirt you can always clean it up before you leave in the selection of washing machines!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"My wife and I were in the area and saw the good reviews and so decided to give El Pollo Rico a try.  I ordered the tri tip wet burrito and my wife ordered the chicken fajita burrito.  

While both were very large and visually appealing the taste left something to be desired.  The meat was overly salty in both burritos and there wasn't much other flavor going on.  

A let down because I feel like they have potential.  We did enjoy the outdoor seating.  

They also lose a star for an asinine no free refill policy on fountain drinks... 

If you're looking for decent Mexican food go elsewhere."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"OH MY GOD, best chimichanga i've ever had... not to mention VEGETARIAN! Their hours seem to be kind of inconsistent, which sucks.

I ordered a burrito to-go three bites in there was a long strand of hair in my food. I was just getting into town and had to go get food elsewhere at 10pm. Needless to say I will never eat here and I suggest you don't either."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Great food, friendly people, and a chill environment to enjoy a meal that is not too pricy. The pasilla torta is my favorite. I feel like I tell everyone about it because it's that delicious. Give this place a try if you're in the area."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Their pastor is really good. I wanted to switch my plate of dry chicken (I was surprised cause reviews said it was good) with my hubby's dish. The pastor was a little greasier than other places but I gave it 4 stars cause it was super delicious.  Anyone tried their burgers? Cause it looked pretty good on their menu.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"More like 3.75 stars.

This was my second stop on the grand tour of Old Town Hollister's taquerias. 

The general theme is marinated charbroiled chicken, and tri-tip, but there is so much more. I witnessed the biggest chimichanga ever being deep fried that had me so awestruck, I stalked the server carrying it the table and asked the diner what the hell that was. Even he was surprised at the mass and girth of that deep fried monster.
Wrap it up in some bacon and you've got a meal that just might rival a Luther burger. 

But too bad, I'd already ordered my own meal of two sopes for $5.99. Choice of chicken, tri-tip or one of each. One of each, please. And they came topped with refried beans, cheese, tomato, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole. Like a Dagwood of sopes. 
And oh lord was it substantial. Eating all of it was just one of several regrets I had about el Pollo Rico. The other, hinted at above, was not being able to sample the ginormo chimichanga, and also not seeing the taquitos on the menu until it was too late. Another time, another time.

My dining companion got the tri-tip tacos, and while they seemed puny compared to my sope mountains, they were enough to feed him, and only $2.25 each.

Compare the chicken with the other big chain of marinated charbroiled chicken, but make this business all local and just as reasonably priced. That's el Pollo Rico. There's also combination platters, and gringo food like burgers. And they cater. AND this place shares the building with a laundromat, with wifi! 

Patrons were a good mix of nerdy engineer types and Mexicans. The nice woman at the counter was fluidly bilingual. 

I'll be back, once I finish my Old Town Tour. But first, I need to sleep off my food coma."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,I love this place! The food is freshly cooked and the staff are all SOO beyond friendly! This is easily the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara (which is severely lacking in good Mexican food). Come here to get a solid burrito and a beer! You won't regret it!
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"The enormous chimichanga my friend and I witnessed but did not sample during our last visit has been haunting us. So we ate there today to face our demons and ordered one. Asada, just one, to share.

They delivered a bomb of a deep fried burrito to our table with a smile. Split between two people, we managed it, and the marinated beef steak was delicious. If McMarko and I ever get in a big fight and stop eating lunch with each other, I am in big trouble, because I would not be able to handle that whopper alone.

Also on order was the large plate of chips. Yes, it costs $1.25, or $0.50 for a small bag, and we groused about it for a minute, but once we chomped down on them, we were sold. Really crunchy and yummy. In fact, I couldn't stop eating the chips and my scary-huge chimichanga almost started getting cold. 

With these items, plus a big hortchata, the bill was just over $10, so about $5 a person, sharing a deep fried burrito, and we left very full."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Great mexican food. A little bit of a divey atmosphere in a small building that's attached to a laundrymat. You order off a photo menu at the cash register that features about 20 choices, including all of what you'd expect at typical mexican-american place. Food quality is above average. The wet burrito with salsa rojo and chicken was excellent. Inexpensive for the area"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,I ordered the breakfast burrito(ham) and it was okay at best.  There were barely any ham in the burrito and I was somewhat expecting eggs in it.   The burrito was mainly stuff with beans and rice.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Excellent real deal Mexican food. Beautiful green and red moles. The best I've tasted in Santa Barbara. The have other less common dishes like Huaraches as well. For breakfast I recommend the Huevos Divorciados eggs separated on tortillas one with the green sauce and the other with the red.  Check out the chicken tinga as well! 

The restaurant is across the street from the Goleta Valley Community Center next to a laundry. It may difficult to find as the city has not allowed them to place signage on the front of the street. It has a nice covered outside dining area in the front."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"For a whole in the wall taco shop this places hooks it up. Huge menu, great prices, and good food. If it wasn't for bad location and beet prices this place would be killing the other local taco shops"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This is some good american mexican. Most definitely heavy in calories, but tasty. The food is similar to stuff I could find in LA or SD. The salsas offered are pretty good. The horchata isn't made fresh in house.. but it's standard. The pricing is actually pretty good. The staff is usually nice. I would eat here if I was craving mexican and was in the area."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"I just ordered 3 lunch #17 it was approximately$ 60.00. Worst meal I've had in a long time. The tri-tip was reheated dry and was probably yesterday's, the chicken was burnt and dry. The tortillas were not fresh. I truly hope I don't get sick from the little bit I ate. Needless to say we are definitely not going back."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"The staff is so friendly and kind!  Great food and portions, comfortable atmosphere, and kid friendly.  If I lived here I would be regular so I will be sure to stop in when I am in the area.  Thanks for the great service and hospitality!"

6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"Extremely unwelcoming servers and patrons, food was average at best, and then to top it off as I went to pay my bill they claimed their credit card machine wasn't working and forced me to go to an ATM down the street to get cash - felt completely dishonest and unprofessional."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Food was good, services was friendly. outside eating on a nice day people watching was classic. we will be back!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"After celebrating the night before on Friday night; we all needed Menudo to feel better and continue. Read the reviews and found this great Authentic Mexican Restaurant serving this dish on Saturday, most of us had Menudo I ordered the Verde Posole, another friend ordered the Chili Verde omelet. We all enjoyed our meals and within a few hours we hit the wineries in SB. I highly recommend, very colorful rooms great to take pics."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Freshly cooked Mexican food with various specialties like mole and 7 Mares and weekend menudo. We came on a Tuesday and they had Taco Tuesday 3 for $5. We got the *Chile Verde* with carne asada, very tender meat. Also got the *Sopes* plate with al pastor and carne asada, both very tender and flavorful. Comes with chips as an appetizer. Tasty and the portion size was generous!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"this place is so bad they put lettuce in our taco beans were watered over priced and pretty sure they used fake pictures wasn't accurate, really small portions"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Why do I like this place?  Well, the 'beans' are really yummy in a weird weird way.  And they have mac 'n' cheese.  And sometimes you just need something they have and nowhere else will sell it.  Mostly I came here on chicken errand runs, but for a place with a type of meat in their name, this was relatively veggie friendly.  Easy parking here too."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This place is amazing! My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food, and decided to give this place a try and I'm so glad we did. The food is really good and the people who work there are even better. Couldn't ask for better service. We'll be back for sure!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Good food, pretty cheap, just had the Sopes they are really big and yummy!!!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"I wish I had better things to say about their menudo. A bit pricey for a watered-down bowl, not much body to it. Had to add almost all of the extra side additives to get some flavor. I was really disappointed about the whole thing. I don't think I'll be stopping here again"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Probably the best enchiladas I've ever had! They make them so good here, all the other dishes are great too. It's a good spot to eat for lunch if your craving authentic Mexican food, 100% recommend."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Great place! Under new ownership and the asada tacos are great. All the salsas are obviously made from scratch and the owners are wonderfully friendly. I could also smell someone's tripa plate from across a few tables, made me wish I had ordered it!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"The service sucks and I was overcharged for a tri-tip plate where I was given 3 dime sized slices of, I guess they called it meat and 1 3"" slice of meat and this was supposed to satisfy my 14yo son!!!!!!!!!! And the meat was dryer than Joshua tree in the summer. I don't recommend this place to anyone not even the people I don't care for.. it's just wrong to say that you're a restaurant"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This was truly a special place. Recently opened by Esteban and his wife, they are doing it all themselves. The food was AUTHENTIC and delicious. Esteban came out of the kitchen to see how we liked our food and told us his story. It's places like this, that make you want to come back again and again."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Great food. Super reasonable for lunch. This spot is in an area with some good food and Pollo Rico holds it down.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This place is AUTHENTIC. They have karaoke, and even an outdoor seating area if it gets too loud. The food is amazing; probably some of the best Mexican food I've had in awhile. From homemade mole to homemade salsa, what more could you want!? Everything is made fresh to order, but fast! The couple who own the restaurant are so beyond kind with amazing customer service. Definitely somewhere I will be returning to!"

6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Great atmosphere, food, and service! Was looking for a place that made a loaded breakfast burrito and I was 100% satisfied. Ate until I could not physically eat anything else. There's also a nice outdoor patio, which is great to eat at with COVID."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Once again Yelp brought me to another nice little place. Extremely happy. Had the Chili Verde Burrito. Huge. Smothered in Verde sauce with drizzle of sour cream.  Nice lettuce, onion and tomato salad and more home made chips on the side. The carnitas filling, along with rice and beans, was perfect. Soft and flavorful. The salsa bar was fun too, with about five different flavors to sample. All very tasty. Lovely husband and wife team cooking and serving. Very welcoming. Good Mexican music. All-in-all: heartily recommend."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This place is great. I take a group of disabled guys here from time to time and the staff is always really nice with us- to say nothing about the food, which is delicious. Their quesadillas are my favorite!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Great food and service. Loved the Machaca. The salsa was really good and they make fresh Tortillas.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Whenever I come I still get the veggie sopes with rice and bean. Everything is cooked to perfection and the owners are a sweet and kind couple. They are such hard working people. They have a great flan for dessert and yummy smoothies!
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Fantastic. East coast guy that has been missing great Mexican and this place delivered! And then some. Don't miss it.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"I had booked this restaurant for a corporate event. We arranged tacos for 65 people. They quoted me a price and we paid. When the event came, the owner showed up with all the food already prepared. The food was good and everything looked nice. Things started going sideways at the end when the owner informed me that we owed more money because there were more people than what we paid for. I questioned him about this because there was a lot of food still left and there was no way for me to prove anything since so many people had already left. The owner informed me that they brought extra. So why would you bring extra when we paid for 65? This makes it appear that they brought the ""extra"" food with the anticipation of charging me and my company more. This is just bad business, especially when you already quoted someone AND you still have a ton of food left. Going forward, my company and I will not be using this restaurant for ANY event in the future!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Amazing Mexican food with a generous smile and heart. 
Try the seafood fajitas and shrimp burritos. You will not b disappointed"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,This place is amazing the staff are very sweet and friendly. The food service was 100%. If you are craving Mexican food I would definitely recommend this place. I got the carne asada burrito with rice and bean and was very happy to have enough left over.  This is a family own business and they work hard to accommodate their  customers. Overall I'm very satisfied with their service and the ambiance. Will definitely come back!
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,We stopped by with my cousins the staff was so friendly and very welcoming i ordered the wet burrito and man it was delish and huge i couldn't take it down lol.... They give you salsa and chips while you wait for your food(thats always a plus for me) if it was only more closer to my house but everytime im in town ill make sure to stop by and get my grub on.... One of the best Mexican restaurants i been too!!! Oh and i forgot to mention they have karaoke lol
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This was our first visit eating at the restaurant and boy did we fall in love! My boyfriend got the Torta Cubana which was one of their specials for the day and it was AMAZING!!!! The three meats' flavors work super together!!! I had to take his other half because it was so unbelievably good! The torta came with chips which is enough for one person. I got the Burrito Mojada with green sauce with al pastor meat. The meat again was amazing!!!! The burrito itself is huge and can be split to share. The sauce was amazing and wish it came with a little bit more. I just need more sauce it was soo good!!!!!This plate also came with chips. We got 2 Jarritos to drink and they have a variety of options to drink-beer, wine, soft drinks. The salsas were also amazing!!! I like spicy salsa so i went ahead and tried all of them and the one that stood out was the quemada sauce/molcajete salsa. They also had a mild salsa as well that was super yummy! They did not have names on them so I can't tell you which ones they are. Overall we are super excited we tried this place and will be coming back!!! I hope there is Chile rellenos next time !!!!!!!!!!!!! (: Felicidades a los dueños ! Congrats to the owners !"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The chicken was crazily dry, they didn't even bother cutting it into small pieces. They came in strips. They cut the side of my throats as I was swallowing. The asada was salty. The rice was undercooked and beans might as well straight from the can. It wasn't cheap and I couldn't even finish it bc it was so horrible. I was looking forward to the rice at least and they messed it up!!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Amazing food and spectacular service. I got the carne asada tacos and they were absolutely delicious. It's now one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Goleta
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Delicious food, as well as one of the most fun places I have gone! Very nice people there and it was such a great experience!!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"How do you tell me my food will be ready in 10 minutes over the phone and make me wait almost 30 once I get there? That makes 0 sense, the food wasn't even worth the wait. There was almost no one in the storefront and they still messed up. Save your time and money, go somewhere else if you don't mind waiting almost an hour for overcooked and under seasoned food. Adding pictures of inside and out to show exactly how empty it was when they messed up."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Muy rico todo. Estábamos en busca de camarones a la diabla y nos encontramos con La Guerrerita Mexican Restaurant. Muy amables y muy buen servicio. 100% recomendado!
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,Decent burrito while waiting for my laundry to finish.  Good positioning!  more later.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"I haven't been here since they changed ownership/name so I thought I would give it a try and it had some good reviews. I ordered my usual when trying a New Mexican place for proper comparison. I got my standard crunchy chicken taco and a Chile relleno a la carte. 

The taco was just average. If there was any cheese on it I didn't see it. The Chile relleno was huge, very cheesy, sauce was ok but thin, and it was tasty enough. The problem with it was the Chile wasn't cooked at all so it was crunchy and the best part of any relleno is the batter but this one was just wrapped into a scrambled egg. 

Their salsa choices wasn't vast but I really liked a couple of them. Chips were okay. Service was fine.

Will I go again? Maybe but I'd try something different."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Super friendly service, treated us like family not like customers. Ordered the combo plate and it was really good. Came back in the morning for menudo amd once again left more than satisfied. Defenitly recommend to try this family owned resturaunt."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Food was delicious! I ordered chicken verde enchiladas and the chicken was cooked really good. Atmosphere is a little quiet but the workers are really nice.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,The food was delicious and the service was great! They were very attentive! The food was filling and didn't feel heavy! Definitely recommend if you are in the star:)
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"Terrible restaurant rating overall from the food to the establishment. Sorry to be harsh but the patio was very dirty, with tables not wiped down, trash everywhere, and not a single customer in site. Keep this in mind that there was not another customer nor order and our 6 tacos and ""side of rice"" took 15min. When we get home there are no limes at all even though we asked for extra limes when ordering and she said ""yes of course"". The side of rice is not there. And there's only red salsa. The tacos themselves have no taste and are very watery. There wasn't one good aspect about this place."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"Awful and utterly disappointing after reading the positive reviews we took a chance on lunch there. When we walked in there were two Hispanic plumbers and a Hispanic couple there so I thought maybe it would be ok despite how it looked. Turns out they were all having pozole or menudo so I guess that's what they were there for.  There were crumbs on the table so I took a wipe to it and it came back brown with filth. The bathroom was gross with no toilet paper and so scuzzy I wouldn't let my children use it. The tacos had no onion or cilantro or pico de gallo, just dry meat on lettuce, they had no guacamole at all, the salsa was like flavored water. My husband said the al pastor was the blandest he's ever had. I am a fan of good authentic Mexican food and I'm willing to put up with a lot if the food is good but this was so terrible I wish I could've taken back time and gone somewhere else. I was beyond disappointed."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Really great Mexican food. Flavor is so on point, prices were great, portions were perfect, and that red salsa is phenomenal!!! Definitely coming back"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Wow. What a surprise! 

After spending most of the day in Santa Barbara, we decided to head home instead of trying to sardine ourselves on State Street. It was bustling with weekend shoppers and tourists alike.

We YELPed Goleta Restaurants and came across this place. The outside boasted your classic hole in the wall establishment. It's next to a laundromat across the street from a bus stop.

We showed up early afternoon. Upon entering we were greeted by the owner of the business and informed that they were out of their signature grilled chicken for the day. A good sign right! 

The menu was a knock out list of your classic Mexican top-selling items such as to Taquitos, burritos, tortas, flautist, carnitas, enchiladas, etc. 

I opted for the MENUDO which included the toppings and four corn tortillas. I know what good menudo tastes like. Being 100% Mexican I can vouch that this place really puts a lot of love and effort into their own recipe. The tripe was clean and good quality sans hominy. I prefer the hominy but it wasn't a deal breaker in this case. The broth and tripe alone really did do it for me. 

My wife ordered the tacos dorados which were more like grilled chicken flautas. They were loaded with flavor! The combo platter was served with rice a beans. 

We sampled their salsa bar which also included pickled onions, fried jalapeños, roasted salsa and a variety of red and green salsas. All of them were really good and varied from mild to hot. My favorite was the roasted salsa. It reminded me a lot of what I make in my own home.

The restaurant could have used a bit of a cleaning but I was unaware if the owner was manning the place alone. I didn't see anyone else during our visit. Maybe, he had just had a lunch rush? How knows. Anyways, I can't really discount stars for a couple of dirty tables. 

The food was outstanding! I'd definitely check this place out again! 

Oh one more thing, you have to bus your own trays to the trash cans, empty, and place in dishwashing containers. 

Again,  not discounting any stars for this. 

The customer service and food spoke for itself! 

Buen trabajo amigo!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,Eh. The food is okay. They have a buy one get one free from the AXXESS card. The tri tip and the chicken tasted just okay. The tri tip was also a little tough. I prefer chicken ranch over this place. Probably won't be back.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"I'm from LA so I know what authentic Mexican food taste like. I went in today for the first time ever and had some Menudo, it was soooooo good!!! Best place in SB county for sure! The owner is from Guerrero so it has that home made flavor that most surrounding restaurants lack. Would love to give 10 stars instead of 5, I feel like I'm short changing them. Very friendly and down to earth staff. I felt like I was having lunch at my Tia's house. If you're in the area you have to definitely stop by and check this place out. I'm coming back tomorrow just to try the pozole."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! The owners are the sweetest people ever and the food is delicious!!!!!!! Prices are great, everything is great! EAT HERE :)"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Such a gem of a place! My hubby and I were looking for a quick bite and always passed by, always meaning to go in, but never fully committing. But luck have it that we stopped in finally. 

We ordered mole tacos, potato tacos, an al pastor plate, and cocktel de camarones. Before our food came, they dropped chips and salsa off at the table. My hubby and I are cooks by trade, and he knew he was going to love this salsa before he even tried it. He wasn't wrong! Subtle hints of smokiness, but the fruitiness of the peppers still shine through. 

Enter the rest of the meal. The mole? Beyond description! The flavors were perfectly balanced, not too much chocolate or almond overpowering the myriad of spices that coat your mouth like a warm hug. The courses keep coming, and we are now glazed over, satiated beyond belief.

And yet the best part! Being cooks ourselves, the owners even took the time to speak with us. And I must say, Estevan and Julissa are about as humble as they come. They were so genuine and it meant so much that they would spend part of their evening engaging with us. We will definitely be back, hungry for more!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,This unassuming restaurant ended up being some of the best Mexican food we've had. Everything is homemade and authentic! Definitely get something with the homemade tortillas....and the house made horchata is a must too!
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Excellent food, cheap prices. Usually at prices less than you can make it for at home."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"We stopped for breakfast, each had a burrito - beans (attn: vegetarians... no lard), potatoes, egg and cheese (my husband added sausage). The burros were so large and stuffed with good stuff that we saved half for lunch.

Highlights included a freshly made pico de gallo. And when we ordered coffee, we never expected authentic Mexican coffee, complete with sugar and cinnamon. Service was like eating with family- warm and inviting. We're only in town for a few days, but we will be back tomorrow for more!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"The service here was phenomenal. I have come here two times already and I fell in love with their flavor and seasoning. So good! Highly recommend it if you are looking for a place with real authentic Mexican food. Their food is freshly made! Plus, food plates are big for your money's worth."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Walked In basically because it was across the street from my hotel. Asked the adorable husband and wife owners what was good and got the most amazing dish unlike any Mexican food I've ever had. I'm sure the rest of the menu is just as good - so much obvious love goes into the food.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Wow. Who would expect that a restaurant next to a laundromat would be any good? Honestly, this place serves some of the best chicken I've ever tasted. The skin is crisp, the inside is moist, and the seasoning is delicious. Don't miss this place if you're in the area."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Best Mexican Food In Town Period.

I was very impressed by the authentic taste el polo Rico offers! Myself and a friend of mine would pass by this spot everyday until we finally decided to try it. Needless to say it was amazing!

We ended up stopping by twice in that first day & we came back the next. May even go in today, you need to go try this hidden gem!

Definitely a top recommendation for those of you who love Mexican food. Enjoy!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,So friendly and nice.  A wonderful family owned business with delicious food.  Happy to support them!
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Amazing. Literally the most beautiful burrito I've ever seen/eaten in my life. The people: amazing. The service: unmatched. I have never been more satisfied with a burrito in my life. I'm not even being sarcastic there is not one ounce of falseness in this review. I am unconditionally and irrevocably in love with this restaurant.
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"i tried this place for the first time and spent $27 on 2 ordered of ceviche tostadas and one shrimp cocktail. the lady at the counter was super nice. 
however, the ceviche was... not ceviche? the fish was WARM and it did not have a lemon/lime taste. it actually had no flavor at all.. i did not even eat it. it was very disappointing. i wish i could have gotten my money back. 
the shrimp cocktail was really good so i'm at least glad that was good. 
why was my fish warm??? :/"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"Not memorable. Went for menudo and left semi-unsatisfied and surprisingly light of wallet. Menudo was over-priced and mediocre at best. Salsa bar was a low key highlight. Atmosphere was a bit odd, the restaurant didn't completely fill the space. I probably would not go back unless I was in dire need of menudo. But in that case I would just go to El Rincon."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic hidden gem right next to my hotel. I walked over at a weird time, mid afternoon, and I was the only one in there. The owner greeted me with a smile and was so friendly.

I ordered the Chile Verde Burrito and he told me I made a fantastic and popular choice. I told him I saw pictures and yelp and knew I had to try it. He was so happy to hear that yelp was the reason I stopped in!

He brought over some chips and salsa to enjoy while he made the burrito. He salsa had flavor but it was too runny to really scoop anything onto the chips.

He brought the burrito out and set my table for me. It truly felt like I was having dinner in his living room and I loved it. The burrito was large and tasted amazing. The sauce on the burrito was fantastic and I loved using the extra chips with it.

Overall, this hidden gem was exactly what I wanted. Authentic Mexican food with an extremely friendly atmosphere. I'll definitely stop in again."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Such a great little gem in Goleta! We were in town for a wedding, and we're looking for delicious and fresh Mexican food. El Pollo Rico did not disappoint, and we were quite impressed with the selection, flavors, and personal touches. The salsa bar featured 8 options made by hand, and the menu included something for everyone! The combination platter was a great way to try the must have chicken as well as other items.....the chicken was PERFECT. The rig amount of crisp skin holding in the tender and moist meat....I will definitely come back every time I am in Santa Barbara or Goleta."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Coming up to the airport we wanted some authentic Mexican and came here because of good reviews.  We were not disappointed!! The restaurant is attached to a laundry mat and when we pulled up we knew it was a legitimate family owned and operated business. The husband/wife owners were so charming and lovely to us and our 2 year old daughter.  We got pollo, carne asada and carnitas street tacos (3 of each) and each were delicious! The salsa verde was amazing and they were sweet enough to bring our daughter some papas fritas on the house.  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone, and because of their hospitality we plan to make this a ritual stop when flying in/out of SBA.   

Eat here and you will be full and happy!!!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"I was in the area visiting from LA and planned to attend a Capoeira class down the street, but hadn't eaten all day. I didn't have a bunch of time so I just got the chicken nachos which was really good and filling. It was more than I could handle before my class, so I had to take half of it to go. 

I only gave it 4 stars because the nachos were just above ok. That awkward place between really good and ok. I'm hoping that my next visit will prompt a delicious response and 5 stars. 

We will see!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This place is amazing. The staff is so kind, the prices are great and the food is delicious! Their strawberry smoothie is so fresh and filling. Their juices are also so bomb. I usually get their sopes, if you get the combination it comes with rice and beans! Their torta sauce are also great. Cannot wait to come back! Also, they serve breakfast all day and have kids meals. The owners are such sweet people, they work so hard and open late!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Ordered Chilequiles with Red Sauce and Al Pastor and Huevos Divorciados to go. Huevos Divorciados was perfect and delicious, but the Chilequiles came with green sauce instead and was missing the al pastor. Everything was delicious but sad about the mistakes in the order. Also green sauce was spicy."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"Proving once again that the best Mexican restaurants are often humble, unassuming places, El Pollo Rico shares its shabby-looking building with a laundromat. Many would overlook this book based on its cover, and that would be a major mistake. El Pollo Rico is for real, their food is awesome, and although I am not a local, I suspect this place is criminally under-rated by those who are.

Make no mistake, there is nothing fancy here, this is pretty much the opposite of the nouvelle cuisine that dominates Santa Barbara. There's a walk-up counter where you order and pick up at the same place. But while you wait, you'll catch the savory whiffs of meat meeting ""plancha"" and you'll snack on the complimentary tortilla chips and salsa bar, and you'll know this place is legit.

I had the ""3 Tacos Special,"" which included three different tacos with beef tri-tip, chicken, and carnitas, all made with an identical balance of meat, cilantro, onions, tortilla, and green sauce. Tacos here are neither art or science -- they are thrown together hastily onto double white corn tortillas spilling meat juices and dripping sauce. These tacos are ""finger food"" for the bold, but ""fork food"" for those with spread-collar dress shirts and silk ties, my uniform for my lunch trips here. I loved all of my tacos, but enjoyed the chicken tacos the most. Here, the dark chicken leg meat is marinated in spices, and the taco is at least on par with any chicken taco I have had in my tacolicious city of residence, San Diego. My 3 tacos were served with a scoop of addictive refried beans, a pat of piquant guacamole, and some salty tomato-tinged rice.

On another visit, I ordered the ""Sopes"" with beef tri-tip, and I much enjoyed those as well. Here, the picaditas are painted with a layer of El Pollo Rico's excellent refried beans, then covered with a layer of sliced crispy tri-tip steak, then topped with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and media crema. This served as tremendous relief to my mouth, which was on fire from the complimentary tortilla chips and salsa. Moreover, these sopes brought flavors to bear that encapsulate what Mexican cuisine ought to be about: delicious marinated-then-charred meats and earthy, creamy refried pinto beans combining to create a home-cooked taste that your good Mexican friends will brag that only their ""abuela"" can create.

Out of the half-dozen Mexican restaurants I have visited in Santa Barbara (including that similarly-named very famous one), this is the place I believe is the very best, and the only one I would get off the highway for if I were just passing through.

6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,negative,"Nothing stood out to me about this food. I ordered a burrito de asada. The asada was lacking a good marinade, had lots of nerve-y parts. The inside could use a solid cleaning and aeration. Not a place I'd eagerly return to. Friendly staff though. Super nice and accommodating."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,Hidden gem! The tomatillo is absolute fire  One of the best Mexican food places I've had in Goleta/SB
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"This was a second choice after we found out the restaurant we were originally heading to closed early. We are so glad our first choice fell through! 

The owners were so nice and welcoming, and the food was amazing - we had something from the whiteboard in front - The Piñata Burrito. Not on the regular menu, and if it isn't on the whiteboard when you come, I'm sure they'll make it anyway - highly recommended!!

We showed up near the end of the night, other restaurants were closed or closing, and by that time they were running low on their bottled drinks - again, fate played a hand and she basically brought the few drinks that were left so we could choose, which forced us to try something new - some amazing flavors we wouldn't have thought to order otherwise - we have some new favorite sodas as of tonight!

Back at the hotel now, feeling super contented. We'll be back!"
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,This small mexican restaurant was unbelievable. I had just got in from a long flight and this was just what i needed.

6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,"What a great hole-in-the-wall spot! 

I came here on a random Wednesday evening and this place was pretty deserted. I ordered the Burrito Chile Verde which includes your choice of meat (chicken, pork, carne asada, al pastor, etc.), rice, beans and cheese. What blew me away with this dish was that there were fajita-styled bell peppers in the burrito which made this dish 10x better! It was nicely seasoned and it came with a side of sour cream, guac, and tortilla chips. The burrito is about average size but it can be filling depending how hungry you are. I was able to finish the whole thing.

The only feedback I have about this dish was that it was extremely salty. For the rest of the night, I had to chug basically a lake full of water. Nonetheless, the dish was very good for the heart and stomach despite the skyrocketing sodium intake! 

Come and support this great mom and pop shop!"

They had excellent flavor as well as the rice and beans. 

We passed through after I had training for work one day and I'm glad we stopped!

My wife's menudo was good she said. I can't speak for myself as I do not like menudo. 

If I was back in the area I may stop back by."
6kPHr6gZaU9732ptn9gJrA,La Guerrerita Mexican Food,Mexican,positive,We ate here a few days ago on our way to San Francisco. I would recommend this place to have fresh homemade Mexican food. Their was a small wait but it was worth it as the food was freshly made and very delicious!!! :)
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Had the lengua burrito. It was non greesy and plated neatly. Simple food that was easy on the wallet. Think I will try the flan next time
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The chorizo tacos are amazing!!! We also tried the carne asada and shrimp tacos, amazing as well. The potato taquitos had great flavor and the service was excellent!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I loved this place. These tacos were delicious and the salsa options were fantastic. 

There isn't much to say. You walk to the counter, order the food, get your salsa from the salsa bar, and chow down. 

If you want street tacos, look no further. You've reached the spot."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Stayed down the road from this place and walked past it a few times a day without trying it -- glad I finally did! Incredible veggie tacos! They had two kinds and I tried one of each with their hottest sauce -- no regrets. Very affordable and quick as well. Give it a try!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I stopped here at my stop to Santa Barbara, coming down to LA from San Francisco. The food was amazing, and delicious. I would recommend anyone who like authentic Mexican food to stop and eat here. Good place."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,So good. Real Mexico City style. Alambres are amazing and few Mexican restaurants have them. Very authentic. My new favorite place in Santa Barbara!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Oh my goodness. Imagine a hangry woman speed walking down the street looking for some good eats. 

That was me right before Yelp and this Taqueria saved the day (the alternative was Rusty's Pizza).

I stared at the menu, practiced my Spanish, squinted at the jamon & pineapple, and order the sabores plate (with ham and pineapple).

Did not disappoint!!  I expected the taste of ham and pineapple pizza, but I got Mexican tacos on my taste buds!  Growing up with Sonoran Mexican food,  I loved this unexpected find. 

And I loved that the place was very, very clean. The hot green salsa was also great -- sometimes people are exaggerating when they label salsa hot, but this restaurant wasn't messing around. 

I found me some good Mexican food in SB, and I'm now on the hunt for more."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"some days i want tacos
so when i visit this place i was happy

uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Best tacos in SB!  Front counter guy always pleasant and friendly too. Love this place.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Cuernavaca is a great place for tacos. There are very few places outside of Mexico City street vendors that will get my endorsement for tacos, and this is one of those places.
They have an amazing salsa bar to go with those tacos. Try some of their tripas tacos if your safety bubble is not bigger than arms lenght."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Handsdown the best pastor taco around. The other tacos are decent but pastor is the way to go!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Tiny little place a few blocks from State St. on Carrillo.  Awesome spicy dishes and great tacos.  If you like a good little Tacoria and Gorditas come here and get your grub on.  I would compare this place a bit to Lilly's but they serve so much more.  I am a huge fan of the Al Pastor Tacos here as they are served with a little bit of grilled pineapple on each one.  There gorditas are awesome too.  Price is cheap and the food is great.  Not many places to sit and eat, but when you walk into a place like that and your the only white boy, you know its good!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best carnitas taco (on the daily special menu) I've ever had, really juicy and tender meat. The carne asada torta was also great. Try everything on the salsa bar, all fantastic!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"A short jaunt from the transit center, this place is a really convenient stop on the way home from work/school. Yummy, cheesy, meaty tacos, and they're CHEAP! They also have tortas, liquados, AND vegetarian options. It's also a really cute, warm atmosphere. Tacos al pastor is a winner (love the added fresh pineapple!), so are their potato tacos (a lot of places don't seem to make these, but so glad these guys do!) 

The place is small and can get really crowded around lunchtime, but it's also a very nice and warmly decorated dining room for a little taco place. I'd go here over Lily's any day."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Having grown up in San Diego, I'd like to think I know Mexican food pretty well. There are probably 2 Mexican eateries for every person living down here. While you can find a burrito on every block, that doesn't mean they're all created equal. Having eaten my weight in carne asada burritos over the years, I've compiled a wish list for what I look for in a good burrito:

1) It doesn't leak; nothing's worse than picking up your loved one only to have them drip all over your pants.
2) The tortilla doesn't fall apart, come undone, or otherwise misbehave in any inappropriate matter.
3) The meat (beef/ pork/ chicken, etc) is GRILLED. Not boiled. Not pan-fried. Not heated by a magnifying glass channeling the sun. 

We stopped here on a whim after driving back from Avila Beach. I ordered a shrimp burrito and my wife had the 2 taco plate. The burrito was delicious and may go down as the best I've had in recent years. Not only did it meet my requirements, but it exceeded them. It was ""just right"" in size, i.e. not humongous and leaving you in a food coma. Also, it was cut in half, making it much easier to eat and put salsa on. As you eat. The tacos were also great and well-proportioned. Service was friendly and fast. Place was clean. Get in here. Quick."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"True Mexican taqueria. True authentic Mexican Food. Muy buenos tacos, sopes y gorditas.

My family and I were at UCSB for a Softball camp and stopped at this restaurant on our way back home to San Diego. I must say, it was well worth our stop. 

As a Tijuana native, hime of street tacos, I approve this taqueria."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Uhm, delicious!  We were in the mood for some no fuss, delicious Mexican food. This place hit the spot nicely!  I tried the tacos al pastor (one of my favorites), and it was amazing!  My companion got two other tacos and they were good as well. We also tried a chicharron and green chile gordita, that wasn't my favorite, but my companion said his was better than mine, even though we got the same thing.  The salsa bar was pretty good...when they say hot, they mean it!  The seating was cute, but we didn't eat there and took it to go.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for laid-back, delicious food!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is my first time to this restaurant.  My first impression was the cleanliness. The place looked nice and well kept a place I felt comfortable eating at. Parking wasn't a problem when I came around 4 pm but I can imagine parking might more difficult during peak hours. I came just for the tacos and tried the tacos al pastor and chicken tacos.  The tacos were great and the portions I feel we're good value for the price and the extra condiments were free (salsa, onions, radish, cilantro, limes). The Jamaica drink was delicious and the food was made to order. The wait for the food was fast and took about 5 minutes. Thanks for the great food. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Very good food! The churros with ice cream were pretty amazing. Nice atmosphere and a very friendly and helpful staff that accommodated my girlfriends food allergies. A nice place off of State street.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"We were on a mission to find tacos al pastor after a great Vegas trip. This is where we ended up. The tacos were delicious (albeit not nearly as amazing as Tacos el Gordo). Service was super fast, tacos and salsas were tasty. No complaints!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Excellent Mexican food. I typically get one of their Alambres specials, and have never been let down.I also throw in a couple of their Al Pastor Tacos, as the meat is served hot off the rotating spit, with some fresh corn tortillas, and a slice of Pineapple. Outside of the normal Tacos and Burritos, they serve quite a bit of other mexican cuisine like Gorditas, taquitos, sopes, and more. Also, don't be fooled by the Avocado green salsa, it's pretty darn spicy. They also make fresh horchata. Depending on time, parking can be difficult, however its worth the walk if you trekking there. An Excellent alternative to Lilly's tacos (whom is also closed on tuesdays as well)"

They were that good.  Loved their al pastor tacos, tried their quesadilla, burrito and taco de chicharon, even brought some home.  Also loved their taco de raja con queso.  I understand they have one in Ventura and opening in Oxnard.  Would most definitely make the drive.  Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting SB."

uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Yelp guided us here after a visit to the SB Mission. Was lucky to find a spot in the tiny parking lot. I had tacos al pastor and my wife had an alambre plate. Everything was delicious; this place is legit! Can't wait to visit again soon!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Best al pastor tacos I've ever had! I also had asada and the vegetarian taco #1 (potato) and they were all very good. Can't go wrong with this place and prices are so reasonable. I'll definitely stop by here again.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"For simple mexican food it is delicous and a great value. To the point, no frills. I will continue to go back for more!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place is quite brilliant! The value and quality of the food is unmatched in SB. I have tried many of the menu offerings and haven't been disappointed yet. The salsa bar can get pretty gnarly due to the insane volume of selfish customers passing through. I am knocking it down a star for that and for the musical chairs that you sometimes need to play when it is busy.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,Food use to be good here they got some new cooks and the quality of food really went down most of the food is way to greasy really disappointed it use to be one of my favorite places to eat lunch

If you're like me and like gringo Mexican food then go somewhere else, but if you want some legit tacos with HOT salsa this is the place for you."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Randomly stumbled upon this spot while we were visiting SB. When we first walked in...  It looked extremely small and we were so close to leaving.  Walked a little further and there's additional tables in the room next door. So we decided to give it a try. 

We were contemplating to try their Torta Cubana or just stick with our usual carne asada burrito.  So glad we chose to try their torta.  Their bread was crispy and not soggy, their marinated pork was packed with flavors and had a bit of crunch,  it also had beans, cheese, ham and avocado. You must try it with their spicy green  sauce from the salsa bar. Also tried their chicken sope and it was pretty good to our liking.  

At the salsa bar..   We first thought that they mixed up their signs between the medium &  spicy.  Medium was the red sauce &  spicy was the green.  A must try. 

The only con is that they didnt sell chips &  guacamole."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,The best pastor tacos around. Their food is delicious all across the board. Truly authentic mexican food.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I've had lots of al pastor in my middle age, living in LosAngeles, but this place has the best. Period.  Based on Yelp reviews, I originally wanted to try a Mexican place on Milpas. There were a few places but no parking, police activity, and mostly tourists.  Yes, that's what I said.  In my experience, being from l.a., whenever tourists are involved, quality goes down, especially in family run Mexican food!  I don't go near the chains!

Anyway, after being bothered about the parking and avoiding the crowds of State St., I stumbled upon Taqueria Cuernavaca.  Tacos al pastor are my fave so getting 3 was a no brainer.   Yum yum yum!   A squirt of lime, some onion and cilantro.  Delicioso!  Not greasy at all and love the pineapple on top!   The salsa selection was decent. The two green salsas seemed too spicy, and the pico de gallo seemed to have no spice, besides tomato.  Oh well.  I'm here for a few more days, I might hit this place up again.  Highly recommend it and will return!!!


Great location, they close early, maybe to keep the late nite Munchie crowd away. Definitely a casual family eatery you want to try!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Wow! Driving from San Luis Obispo to Orange County and needed some good tacos. Yelp reviews were positive so we stopped and loved this place. Everything was very very good. Recommend the Cubano!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great place to stop by for some quick, delicious, authentic Mexican food. Tacos are great! They have a great salsa bar and the atmosphere is nice and cozy. The place is small and it is hard to find parking since they share it with other businesses but it is worth the hassle. If you are craving some tacos, this is the place to go! Haven't tried everything but looking forward to it when I am in town again!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,A favorite casual lunch destination. Tacos and alambres plates are divine. Gorditas are fantastic.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Good street style tacos.  Simple and cheap.  No complaints.  I will return when in the area.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I visited Cuernavaca on Yelp's recommendation and wasn't disappointed. When you order, you're given two sauce cups because they know you'll want some. Warning: I like spicy food, but I know my American palate. I got the mild salsa and it had a fair heat level, which I loved. The pico de gallo was a ridiculously fine mince I envy in my own kitchen.

Worth a stop."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Great traditional Mexican tacos. Favorite is their mixed alambres. Perfect for lunch! Well priced for downtown.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,I could eat here every day. I go through spurts where I eat several meals a week here. They have super cheap prices and just consistently great food. The employees are also nice and the restaurant is very clean. I highly recommend the chicken tinga tacos!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"New traditional Mexican food from Ventura. We used to live on Ventura ave where the original one is and it was our favorite and we were SO sad to leave it when we moved to SB. This new location has changed our lives!!

The al Pastor meat is to die for and the tacos are amazing. They have such good tortas (cubana) and Alambres (plates with tortillas on the side). The price is right on and the salsa bar is so good. 

The owners are the nicest people and they made a big leap coming up here so support them and their amazing food!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The absolute BEST fast food Mexican place in Santa Barbara. The tacos are amazing, and the Plates are generous."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"if I could eat their tacos al pastor every day I would! love the pineapple addition to those tacos. My boyfriend can't get enough of the BRC, taco al pastor and chroizo tacos. 

All in all a perfect bite for lunch!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic, cheap, and quick.  I love lily's .. but this place gives it a run for its money.  Low-key, nicer inside, more than just Tacos.  I'd heard about Cuernavaca from a variety of people, now I see why they rave about it.  I had 5 tacos .. less than 10 bucks, for a perfect dinner (I'm a big eater).  Pastor, chicken, Asada.  All good, maybe Pastor the best, but all good.  And the salsas are terrific.  Great place, great price.  I'll be back."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Yes! Finally an amazing Mexican place that gives you plenty of tortillas, has a salsa bar and tastes great! This place will be a regular in the future."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Really amazing tortillas. They are so fresh and soft. I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas and they were so good.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Since bae was paying, I of course decided to go completely crazy and eat an entire El Fortachon alambre by myself. Dear god, a whole plate with multiple meats and like 20 tortillas? Even a meat-lover like myself was stuffed (I still of course ate the whole thing). It was a great portion for less than $10 and would have easily fed two people and not just one greedy glutton like myself. Everything tasted comforting and well cooked!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Love this place,  the food is bomb,  the atmosphere got better when they expanded their eating area.  I love walking into a place where they recognize your face and smile.  Super good,  super friendly..."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great food. Their food is always fresh. I like to get the taquito plate. The food is consistent. The salsa bar is nice, too. The creamy green salsa is my favorite. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good quality food."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"There isn't much seating here for families, but whole entire families come to this place anyway. And rightly so. The food is delightful. I'm strictly a burrito-man but when it came to making a freshly-rolled, no-tricks kinda meal? This burrito was worthy of its rather large weight. I think it has some special sauce that might be ranch dressing mixed with something else, but anyway, it's tender. If I lived here, one would see me entering the Cuernavaca with a fifty-gallon jug meant to use for filling up with water or rainbow gold, but this time, I would be filling it with only chx burritos add avo. So I could store them in my fridge for later. Shame, I don't think they would taste as good fresh. The staff is nice and freshly governed by OG man behind the register who speaks both English and Spanish. Come grab something. I heard the Cuban meal takes the cake too. Great work. Remember reader, this isn't about Michelin stars here...safe, friendly, good-food."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Stopped in for tacos to go before hitting the beach. We got carne asada tacos and a quesadilla con rajas and champinones (jalapeno & mushrooms). Both were super flavorful and we left satisfied. Worth it to hit up their salsa bar too. Staff is super friendly.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Buenisimo, pedi el alambre especial, en ningun otro lado en California el sabor es tan parecido al del sur de México.
EXCELENTE sabor, sazón.
Totalmente recomendable"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome!!! If you're looking for authentic, delicious Mexican food, this is the place! They have great options for vegetarians too."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great food for reasonable prices. We will definitely be back! We only ordered asada and shrimp tacos, but they were delicious! The salsa bar was great. This place is very clean and the staff are very nice and attentive. We will definitely come back!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,We were heading back to LA from a fishing trip and wanted to stop for our customary Mexican Food...man were we in for a treat. The tacos (asada) and Sopes (marinated chicken) were AWESOME!!!! And the price was great too.  Great pit stop...Will definitely go again.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,You know the food is delicious when you're already planning a return trip before you've even finished your meal! I had the Especial and hubs had the Mixta... Both amazing!!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place blows Lilly's out of the water. The pastor is so good and the salsas are fresh. They just expanded so there is a ton of seating in the back room. The employees are friendly and always smiling. Parking is usually awful but the food makes up for it.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Don't judge a book by its cover is a cliché that could appropriately be used to describe this restaurant. A friend and I, while visiting California, were in search for the best burrito in Santa Barbara. Yelp and almost an hour of walking past several nicely decorated though slightly touristy looking Mexican sit down restaurants led us here.

We had low expectation when we walked into this restaurant, and I mouthed ""I'm sorry"" to my friend for leading her past a bunch of really trendy looking restaurants to this hole in the wall. ""We walked all the way for this, let's just eat"" she said. We ordered two beef burritos and I poured salsa into those tiny paper cups. 

Burritos were served and after the first bite my friend said ""this is the best burrito I've ever had"", or at least that's what I think she said, because I was too busy stuffing my face with the best burrito I had ever had. People have claimed to have seen god in a grilled cheese sandwich, or a potato chip, but I found one in a delicious beef burrito from Cuernavaca.

It's been a week since I devoured that burrito and it has appeared in at least two of my dreams. My only complaint about this place is that they don't deliver to Florida."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Seriously THE BEST mexican place in town! I found out about this place because it is right next to Mels, a dive bar, which I have recently been frequenting. The beef tacos with rice and beans is the bomb dot com.  for real. If you want authentic, good  and flavorful mexican food i highly recommend this place!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I dont know how I heard about this place but I am glad I did. This place is AWESOME!! I ordered the alhambre and it was very filling and scrumptious. It is a mix of a few different types of meat, some peppers, cheese and topped with an avocado with some tortillas. The plate looked and smelled great and the taste was even better. They have other menu items that look good i.e. tacos, tortas etc. but I have only tasted the alhambre. Im not going to change something if I am completely satisfied with what I have been getting already...

Over all, if you like good gut sticking mexican food this place is must. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. You can thank me later."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Excellent, authentic food.  Great tacos and alambres.  We also really liked the Mangos Licuados for drinks (they were a special the day we ate there)."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is good! Parking is not the greatest, but the food is great. I ordered a torta de carne as Asada and it was fantastic. It comes with carne asada, tomato, avocado, and cheese. Then I got some of the green hot salsa from their salsa bar to top it off. Really good stuff. My wife got the marinated chicken gordita. She enjoyed that as well. Only problem was we ordered a gordita that was supposed to have cheese and Serrano chiles, but it didn't have Serranos. Not that we could taste anyway. If you're ever in downtown Santa Barbara, check them out... you may have to walk some distance though."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Literally, best Mexican food in Santa Barbara... possibly in all of Southern California. You don't taste these flavors outside of Mexico. The ""Alambres"" are similar to burrito bowls/fajitas. They give you a pile of tortillas to make your own tacos with. The Al Pastor is a must try. Salsas are fantastic too. We also had the gordita de tinga, and again, the flavor screamed of deep rural Mexico. Service was friendly and place was clean. I live in Orange County, have tried all the popular Mexican places up here, and this place is so good, I may need to take my mom on a special trip just to eat here."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Best al pastor north of Acapulco. They even got the pineapple right. Delicious salsas to boot. Buenisimo guey!!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I decided to give this place a try, the street tacos are delicious! At $1.60 each, it's a great price for what you get, especially in Santa Barbara! I got the Taquito plate, the chicken was delicious and well seasoned, but the beans and rice had no flavor :(
Salsa was delicious, but hot!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"The people who work here are nice, but the food wasn't very good. I got a carne asada burrito. The meat was so tough and gristly that I picked out/spit out half of it. Gross. But the rice, beans, and tortilla were yummy! The horchata was not from scratch and tasted powdery. Guess I got the wrong stuff!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"First time in Santa Barbara for a while, and had to satisfy a taco craving when I got in. 

I have to say, I the portion of meat you get for $1.60 (al pastor and carne asada) is pretty good. It was a bit dry however, and was screaming for some salsa to be added. I'd say that the salsa selection is the best part of Cuernavaca, especially if you're looking for a nice kick.

Parking is limited, but street parking looked to be available."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Food is great, lots of meat, and prices are amazing. Great salsa bar with pickled onions, cilantro, lime, diced onions and radish slices in the back."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I read a review that the Al Pastor was good here so I decided to check it out.  I ordered a burrito and I was not disappointed.  Not the best I have had but very good. The guac salsa is really delicious and spicy! I loved it. On the menu is something called a ""Gringa"". It looked good but because I am one I was embarrassed to order it! LOL.The prices are a little high but this is Santa Barbara. I will definitely go back again!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I know, I know. I keep giving 5 stars. But after the dearth of good places in my last place of residence, I'm kinda going crazy over these great eateries! RelishSB turned me on to Cuernavaca, and we went the same day.
I had an Cubano Alhambre with milanese and al pastor, and it was the best--a LOT of food, so good if you want leftovers. The yellow salsa is amazing! Seriously, a unique flavor we've never had before. Flavorful, but plenty spicy.
The Husband said best carnitas in SB yet, and he's a connoisseur. It gets busy, and there's a reason why! 
Another reason for 5 stars--VERY clean restaurant and bathroom. Staff are also super friendly."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"We got in late and needed a quick bite to eat. This was the spot. This is your standard Mexican fare but done very well. No Tex Mex. No trendy nouevau Mexican food. But very very tasty. It was so good, it almost made me wish I was drunk because I know how good that greasy Mexican food is on a stomach full of beer. Price is not cheap but you won't break the bank either."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"My friend and me were really hungry and I found this place here on yelp. Thank you guys! it was amazing! I had the torta cubana- soooo good! I would definitely go there again!:)
there were also some kind of different sauces on the tables, stuff was friendly and the prices are good too!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is an amazing  place!   A great find!!!!  The staff was very nice.   The bathrooms are super clean.  The tables and floors are clean.   Worth a visit!!!

I had the beef tacos and the chicken tinga Gordita.  I've never had a Gordita before.  It is delicious.  It's like a thick corn tortilla sliced in half and stuffed with shredded chicken.   They also serve mini burritos that are not on their menu.  

I would highly recommend this place.  One block off the Main Street."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Love this place! Reasonable prices and good portions. Just had the torta Cubana for the first time. Delicious! The alambres, gorditas, tacos, tortas, it all has great taste and at a good price. Definitely will continue coming back."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Delicioso !!!! Food is amazing, staff is really friendly and they have a lot of seating space! Loved it !"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Hands down best Mexican food in Santa Barbara. The al pastor is epic and all the salsas are fresh and full of flavor. I'm pretty sure everyone in my office eats here at least twice a week.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"After a local hike we wanted a decent lunch that was pug friendly and casual. Cuernavaca is the sister branch of their location in Oxnard and is located in small corner strip center which has private parking. I called about a patio and the worker advised me they had one outside table which wasn't occupied.

The minute I stepped into to place my order I had a good feeling about this place since their clients were - 99% Hispanic. I ordered the El Fortachon plate and a El Pastor and Lengua soft tacos. The plate had a variety of protein including chorizo and was topped with fresh slices of ripe avocado that was a home run. The tacos were also solid and packed with pork and beef tongue that was delish.

I would definetly sugest this eatery and the price was resonable for being in Santa Barbara."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is soooo good. The Chicken Sopes are ah-mazing. The meat is super moist with just the right amount of kick. If you want real authentic Mexican food, come and eat here. You wont be disappointed. 

The Horchata is the perfect compliment to any dish. It's not overly sweet or overly watery. Definitely a beverage worth having."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,The plates are like ordering a pretty tasty Mexican hash or scramble covered in melted cheese you can scoop up with the stack of corn tortillas they give you. A very good deal if you're hungry.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Shrimp tacos are the best I've ever had. Every Santa Barbara trip this is a must stop!!!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"We stumbled upon this restaurant while coming back from a road trip up north. We pulled off from the freeway and roamed around til we found a Mexican restaurant (again, in SANTA BARBARA). We thought it had limited seating, but oh surprise they had WAY more tables in the back. We ordered burritos and one of those platters with a LOT of meat. I was surprised to find REAL (read my words carefully, R-E-A-L) carne al pastor!!!!!!!!!! Yes! The one sliced off the 'trompo'. Santa Barbara might not be LA, but Cuernavaca surely helps. That al pastor meat tho... oh man!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great food. Full of locals. Clean, fast and fresh. Food is reasonably priced, and portions are healthy. It's the real deal."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place is great. The food is so good and they add nice touches like fresh avocado. There is plenty of indoor seating and so close to state street. I highly recommend you walk a block and enjoy this reasonably priced food.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"My FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara. Born and raised in LA, I was accustomed to authentic Mexican dishes so moving to SB was completely different since most restaurants are catered for upper middle class meaning overpriced food (3 tacos for 15 dollars are you kidding???), inconsistent flavoring and no sign of Mexican culture ..... Cuernavaca surpasses all restaurants here and they have great prices for it being in SB. I love the art inside and the staff is very efficient and friendly. Clean establishment, amazing food, genuine employees and a great appreciation for Mexican culture! I love it"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Not typical Mexican food. But good. My steak fajitas were good, so was everybody else's food but they messed up our order, it took really long, they forgot my tortillas for my fajitas so by the time they brought them, my food had cooled down... the waitresses were nice. For the type of food we had, the quality of it, it was a bit too pricey. Plus, I really wanted a margarita... which they didn't have. Next time I'm in SB, I'm looking up a different place or just having American...."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"At almost 4.5 stars, and us being from out of town, Yelp pointed us the way to this place for a good burrito. And while it was flavorful, it did not warrant the high ratings. The burritos were just rice, beans, cheese and meat. Where are the other stuff? Sour cream, Guac, pico, was not available apparently. Again, once it came out it was ok, but could have been so much better given the other options. And for $7 each, I expected more."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This eatery is authentic and delicious! We share several dishes and always enjoy the salsas. My favorite is the quesadillas that are more like tacos by my definition. The mushroom and cheese is ahh-mazing!

The sopes are also exquisite. My husband said the chicken burrito is bar none his favorite and the best he has ever had. Yum! 

This place is especially spectacular if you are on a budget in Santa Barbara. 

Consider visiting the art show on Cabrillo on a Sunday morning, grabbing a bite here, touring downtown and taking an evening stroll on the beach."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,The best Mexican spot in California!! You are literally blowing it if you don't eat here!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,One of the best Mexican restaurants three thumbs up it's a must try had fajitas wow so good my daughter cleaned her plate there was no need to wash it
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great al pastor, nice asada. Good neighborhood taqueria but can get loud in the echoey dining area. Very casual counter service w plastic utensils. Good salsa."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Love love love this place. My coworkers and I go once a week. They are super friendly and the burritos are to die for. I go with the asada burrito with avocado inside plus the murky green salsa. It's honestly one of my top 5 places in Sb.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Look out Lilly. These are mighty fine tacos.

El Fortachon alanbres plate was fantastic
Carnitas taco from the specials menu was moist and delicious. Some of the best I've had. 
Packed at 2pm on a Saturday and I know why
Salsa bar has three to choose from, 2 green and a red plus a pico. The green with fresh chopped jalapeño rocks! The red is heavy with smoked chili but not spicy and the smooth green is a creamy avocado, again with little to no kick. All with tons of flavor but I'm sticking with the green jalapeño.

The only down side I can find is parking. It's a small lot shared with Mel's. Cuernavaca is fit for lunch or dinner. Come in and taste for yourself."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"If you like tortas and authentic mexican food, this is the place for you. Their bean rice and cheese burritos are also so yummy and I think it's because of the amazing ingredients, mainly the cheese that they use.  They also have the best Tortas El Pastor!! Super friendly staff who always greet you with a big smile! I really hope that this place makes it because it is really great food! So excited! Now it's perfect and spacious! ! My favorite place for tortas has now added an entire new huge section to the restaurant. It's absolutely beautiful! They could really use some chips and salsa, never been to a Mexican Restaurant that did not serve this. Sorry, that's why no 5 stars."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"We were looking for a quick bite to eat while passing Santa Barbara. I got car sick while browsing the Yelp app, but we ended up stumbling upon Cuernavaca anyway, which is one of the places I bookmarked. 

I was a little confused at first, because I thought it was a restaurant. When I saw the front door and the ""express"" sign, I went to the second door, and it said the same. So I meandered to the third door, and that was a completely different establishment. 

I wasn't sure what to get, so I ordered El Fortachon. It had so many things in it that I figured it couldn't be anything but delicious. The boyfriend got 3 tacos and ended up wishing he had ordered 5, since they were small. I gave him some of my food, though, so it all worked out.

My meal was, as expected, very savory and satisfying. Even though I didn't eat the whole thing, I was stuffed by the end. Btw, tacos come out fast, but everything else seems to have a wait."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Looking for authentic Mexican food in Santa Barbara and we stumbled into this restaurant. I'm glad we did. I didn't know if the alambre plate which I ordered was going to be fulfilling so I got an al pastor taco also. I was definitely wrong. Not only was it a big plate, I ended up finishing the taco and left a small portion to go. They only have sodas in cans and bottles along with horchata waiting for you in a medium size cup. The murals on the walls were definitely detailed work from a good artist. Nothing bad to say about the food. Can't wait to come back sometime if I'm in the area."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"If any of you are familiar with Gustavo Arellano ( AskaMexican) I saw him speak and he mentioned Cuernavaca & how lucky we were to have this restaurant. He specifically mentioned the Alhambre's...I've gone quite a bit to this place. Both teh Ventura ( The Ave.) and the new location in dt. Santa Barbara...Lilly's tacos is very good but they have some competition with Cuernavaca.

The good:
Alhambres- look great. I've never had them but I've seen patrons with thier order of alhambre's and they looked very good. 

Al Pastor - the al pastor meat at this place has to be the best in Ventura/Sb county. I've have tortas, burritos and tacos w al pastor

Tripas- I love tripas. The issue with tripas is some restaurants might not fry them enough which makes the texture rubbery. The rubbery texture is not the ideal taco but many places will serve them this way...not cuernavaca. Their tripa tacos are always crunchy.

Salsa Bar - Good options in their salsa bar. 

The bad:

Parking -location does not have much parking plus it's a very transisted area ( carillo street)

tables - not many tables in this place. Not sure how many tables but not more than 6-7...Most times i've gone there during lunch it's packed! 

Overall, it's a great mexican place & it's pretty affordable for SB prices."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The most authentic Mexican food you will find in SB. Very delicious, clean environment. Hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant in  town. Tough to find parking at times , but it's a must go!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This a great addition to the neighborhood. I am a big fan of the pastor with pineapple and they have a great salsa selection
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Every time we come to SB for a concert or show, we stop here for dinner. Really love their food."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Amazing! Their burrito al pastor is great and has me going back constantly . The quesadillas are just perfect! Great staff and and great food.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I went a couple days ago and I must say that this place has the best al pastor and salsas I've ever had. I got the torta Cubana with an horchata. The torta Cubana was so delicious! I would recommend it to anybody. The salsas made it even better. The horchata was really good and flavorful it was not too sweet. Place is clean and has an excellent vibe! I love that the items on the menu are in Spanish first and then explained in english. Overall, if your looking to satisfy your appetite I strongly recommend coming here."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Short version:

* tacos al pastor
* veggie tacos
* great prices
* overall: hell yeah.

Long version:

For some time I've seen the reviews rolling in for the Ventura location, so when I heard the owners were opening a SB location, I got pretty excited.
I rallied some friends and went in one evening. Two things immediately stood out: we were the only gringos there, and it was hella busy. 

We did the typical mouths agape gazing up at the menu for way too long and ordered a pile of food. Only afterwards I asked them what were the most popular items from the Ventura location and the guys said we'd covered it pretty well, so yay on that count. And the guys behind the counter were really friendly, even though we were pretty clueless and holding up the queue.

Al pastor, as nearly everyone has said, is one of Cuernavaca's specialties. The pork is not only marinated with pineapple, but served with a fresh chunk of it on top of the taco. Sweet and spicy all in one. It's ridiculously good and just $1.60 each, so order two of them because someone in your group is gonna want a bite of it and you'll be all, ""nuh-uh.""

I also really liked the veggie taco #2, which is mushrooms, rajas and cheese. Others at the table ordered the potato, rajas and cheese and it looked delicious, but I did not try. The more simple rajas and cheese was okay, a bit too soft and mushy for my tastes.

Onto the gorditas, we got one of the specials, which was a crispy fried pork, like the ""fond"" of carnitas, I really liked that. We also got the chicharron gordita, and their style is soft cooked in green sauce. I like my pork more on the crispy side, so I preferred the special gordita over the chicharron. 

The folks working there said all the Mexican drinks are made from scratch. We got horchata, which was spiced in a way I'd never had before. Perhaps a bit on the sweet side, but overall very nice. I don't know how else to describe it other than a horchata reminiscent of bubble gum...? 

The menu isn't enormous, but there's still a lot more I need to get to and I'm very excited to do so. The items I've had were mouth-wateringly delicious. No wonder the original location has such rabid fans.

A few logistical notes:

$10 minimum for credit cards. No worries, pair up with a friend and get a pile of tacos. 

It closes at 8:30 pm. This is not meant for the late night drunk crowd. Think more for lunches and family dinners. This is not a complaint on my part. Just a note in case you're browsing this review at 2 am, eyes unfocused, in a perceived state of dire starvation. 

Parking is very tight. About 8 spaces, shared with Mel's and the Grapeseed company. You will likely have to park on the street and walk the extra 50 feet, if you can bear it. 

The interior, although nice for hole-in-the-wall style taqueria, is very small. There's seating for maybe 12-15 people. The time I was there, it was packed, mostly with families. I think this is a very good sign for the restaurant, but be prepared to rub elbows with other folks, or get your food to go. 

You know what? Those last two bits shouldn't even be an issue, if you live downtown. Y'all should be walking more anyway."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"My favorite tacos in Santa Barbara. Anything that has the al pastor is delicious. I also really enjoy the Veggie Taco #1: fried potatoes with a ton of cheese. They have an excellent salsa bar but the salsas tend to be on the hot side.

They aren't as quick as another taco place in town, so plan on sitting down for a couple of minutes while you wait."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Yes, this place is a little off the beaten path of state street but that is all the more reason to try it.  My hubby loved the dish called the ""Normal"".  It was delish.  I had chicken sopes and Mexican chorizo sopes (they let me mix my order which was nice).  We also tried a chicharon gordita, but I wasn't a fan of that.  Would have much preferred the chicken over that chicharon.  I was hoping for for fried chicharon, but it was kind of gelatenous and definitely not my thing!  So all in all we'd come back for the ""Normal"" which was anything but, and I would opt for chicken tacos as that chicken was tasty!  Salsa bar was great too."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Stopped at Cuernavaca for lunch and was very excited to try this place. While the food was decent, there was a mistake with my order that left me quite disappointed. I walked 15 minutes each direction to pickup a chicken burrito, only to find they served me a bean, rice, and cheese burrito by mistake. I wasn't about to walk back to get the order corrected as I was on my lunch break, but it's a huge disappointment to receive an incorrect order even after leaving a tip. I'll give them another try in the future as the food was decent, but I'm worried I might receive another incorrect order."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Tacos were very good. Just a bit on the salty side. I like food very well-seasoned, and the different meats in the tacos (except for the lengua) were still a little too salty for me. Not a fan at all of the chicharron gordita. The big bummer is that they don't sell chips. Probably a good thing, though, bc their salsa bar would certainly make it very easy to down a few baskets in one sitting. We had:
-asada taco: very good and meaty. Not greasy! 
-al pastor taco: I can see why this is popular. Very, very good. I don't know why people complain about the pineapple. I just ate it first. It's not even mixed in.
-chorizo taco with cheese: good and flavorful. Even for chorizo it was on the salty side. I liked that it wasn't floating in a pool of orange grease.
-chicken taco: it's shredded chicken. I'm not a fan of this kind of chicken but friend liked it.
-lengua taco: super tender but not much flavor.
-chicharron gordita: what a disappointment. The chicharron was just slabs of tasteless, wobbly, wiggly fat.  Pulled that all out and just ate the gordita without it. Decent that way.

The al pastor, asada and chorizo tacos would constitute 4.5-5 stars. The tacos were really good, and we would go back again in a heartbeat for those and the salsa bar. The chicharron gordita was disappointing, and I thought the chicken and lengua were just okay."

Authentic Mexican food , good prices , looks clean and staff is friendly"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is top shelf, fresh, made to order authentic Mexican food with counter service which keeps prices low.

In my travels of Mexico and California this is the real deal. The ONLY thing lacking is hand made corn tortillas. The flavors, the Salsa, the Horchata, the Art, the People, the Prices...this IS real deal mainland Mexican food.  

Simply Excellent."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Tasty food and flawless presentation... But no chips is a bummer, especially with that beautiful salsa bar. What a waste and a def downer for me personally..."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,I absolutely love the suadero tacos! The day I went they had a blackout and a friend of mine lost her keys in the dark. Everyone was really nice and friendly and helped us look. I live in LA but I am really considering going back to Santa Barbara just for the suadero tacos.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is an unusual and unusually good taqueria. The food is excellent, but non-traditional -- muy mexicano. My favorites are the tortas!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"El Fortschon y Sopes:Chorizo. Delicious.  No signs of sustainable,  organic, local, or free range. Nor alternative currency acceptance or collective work environment. The search continues :)"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Had the quesadillas which were essentially cheesey big tacos. I did mix and match. The flavor is great and typical of a good side restaurant in Mexico. The atmosphere in back is nice. Def hit the spot and what I was looking for.

All three quesadillas were great! I recommend chicken tinga if you like spice. If you're less adventurous the queso one will do. 

I would have taken pics but I ate every last morsel within minutes."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"The gordita was the best thing we tried. The chicken tinga was actually pretty spicy, but the other chicken was exceedingly bland. The al pastor was pretty dried out. I should add that we came close to closing, and they were out of most  items that we wanted (including horchata!). I found it disappointing and wouldn't go back."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great food, service was ok. Decent seating. Had torta and gordita. I was nice and full, all my accompanying party had something mostly diffrently and everyone enjoyed everything. Would definitely come back"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best chicken burrito I've ever had. It doesn't come with anything, so order sides if you want them. The inside of the restaurant is clean and inviting. The service was fast."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The sopes are perhaps the best thing here. Add chicken!
Also, try their horchata and their Nuez Shakes. Great prices but they are closed on Tuesdays! Makes no sense!
Pretty stocked salsa bar and the restroom is clean!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is sooooo good. I'm so glad I finally tried it!! The chicken was so juicy and full of flavor, it was the perfect chicken taco. I don't even eat pork regularly but I tried my bf's carnitas tacos and they were amazing as well. So good that I would probably order them myself next time. The salsa was incredible and the rice was delicious. Word of caution: the hot salsa really is hot. I could only put it on one of my tacos. Both of us spent under $8 and got enough food to stay full for hours. This place honestly blew me away, the meat was just incredibly full of flavor. Can't recommend enough!!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I love it when restaurants get the simple things right! It may be exciting to have your tacos laced with Chiplotle-Hazelnut Glaze and a sprig of Organic Norwegian Lichen but it all falls apart when the tortilla sucks, or the rice is pasty.

Cuernavaca doesn't have any of that fancy crap, but the rice, beans, meat, tortillas are just done RIGHT! Everything is cooked to perfection, seasoned nicely and assembled with care. Also, it's the only Mexican restaurant I've been to that actually gives you enough tortillas for the quantity of food. What's up with getting 2 tortillas and a pound of fajitas!? That doesn't happen here!

The salsa bar has a couple rare and tasty options that aren't found in many other places (the Peanut salsa is a smokey, hearty treat and the avocado salsa is refreshing in spite of its high spiciness).

Everything I've had is delicious and there are a couple really nice vegetarian options... I have a hard time staying away from the Sabores though. The Pastor is truly a delicious treat."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"We went to the location in Ventura first, on our way up to Santa Barbara, and it was amazing. Original delicious and spicy salsas. We had the special shrimp tacos with garlic sauce and cheese. Amazing. They told us about this location, and we had to go again in the same weekend, and it was just as good as the one in Ventura. It's too bad we are so far away."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Fresh ingredient and tasty food and spices.  The tortillas are hot and fresh tasting. The restaurant is  clean and well maintained.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Come here with the proper expectations and you won't be disappointed

This is a top notch taqueria serving very good tacos in an honest and friendly style with fresh and tasty ingredients at very low prices.   Food comes out freshly prepared and fairly quick.  We tried a wide variety of meats like to Carne asada , pollo, and carnitas.   Our favorites were the Carne asada and the carnitas  -- very succulent and well seasoned.   Tortillas were fresh and tasty as well.  Salsa bar is stocked with incredibly flavored salsas and was well stocked throughout our time there.   Small parking right in front.  Crowded interior but high turnover as most do takeout.  

In short, if you want a fancy dining experience, you should not be at Cuernavaca.   But if you want good food at cheap prices served fast and fresh, you should make the trek over to here.  

For 1.60 per taco we stocked up on lots of different ones and still found ourselves craving for more."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Solid authentic Mexican food. There were a lot of Hispanic locals when we went so we knew we hit the jackpot. The prices were very reasonable, and the meal was satisfying and filling. 

I would recommend the sopes. I had one of each and was not disappointed by any of them! I really liked the base -- it was warm, dense, and the flavor was just right enough to compliment what went on top. I just didn't like the al pastor that much. The meat didn't taste as flavorful as it looked. Sorry not sorry. 

Also, there is a free toppings bar in the back of the restaurant. It looks small at first but there's a room to fit many people in the back. Ordering is also very efficient."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"If you want delicious,  authentic Mexican food,  go to this hidden gem.  Tacos Cuernavaca is in a small strip mall on a one way street.  They serve some of the best tacos,  I've tried the Carne asada and the lengua, the meat is so tender and tasty. My husband & 2 sons order carne asada burittos, all differently (no rice, no beans, extra cheese...etc. etc).  This place gets it right each time.   The only downfall is parking,  hard to find at times."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Cheap small tacos, from $1.60 for the meat tacos and $2.30 for vegetarian tacos. Flavorful and on the spicy side. The pico de gallo and other sauces are also HOT. Beware and be careful. You know it's good when there's a lot of Mexican folks line up and order the authentic fare. I definitely will come back and try their burrito."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Al pastor tortas and shrimp and queso tacos. Shut the front door.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Holly yummy! Just passing through and this place did not disappoint at all. The alambres was the best Mexican entree I have ever had. Also, good prices!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Friendly staff and delicious food. I usually call ahead and place my order especially when you want it to go. They can get quite busy. Their burritos are out of this world. The torta cubana one of the best that Santa Barbara has to offer.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is the real deal, GREAT food. worth the trouble to park your car, well worth it. Leaves me wanting more !!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,I like their flour and corn tortillas but other than that the other items had no flavor plus it was on the pricier side so just expected more. Plus they had no  chips . being in sb I thought the.mexican food would be better than my SF hometown .. But nope not this place. this was the definition of meh for me.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Authentica Mexicana Comida.....and cheap too!  Had the Fortachon Plate which could feed three.  Also had AlPastor, Carnitas, Soft Tacos.. all good with a Salsa Bar containing multiple, spicy, salsas.  Horchata is also tasty.

The place has a small parking lot and lots of tables in a side room."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"One of the best taquerias in SB. Love their burritos, but everything is good. Best when you add avo and sour cream!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"My husband has been telling me about this place for a long time now and we finally came! This is the BEST taco spot I've ever visited and I'm 26, live in southern california and eat out a LOT, so that alone says a lot. I ordered chicken and alpastor tacos AND a sope of asada, I was a bit hungry  (i skipped breakfast). The tacos were sooo moist and the meat was well seasoned. Okay and that green  salsa mixed with avocado is beyond words. We'll definitely be coming for more!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"By far the best chicken burrito in Santa Barbara. Chicken burrito, add avocado, and get some green salsa to pour on for each bite. There isn't a better flavor combination you can taste with each bite. 

I recently moved away, but I know the second I come back to visit Santa Barbara, this is my first stop. 100/10. Great and friendly employees as well, and the food comes out quickly."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Bomb.com. The carne asada tacos, the torta, the gordita, and the salsa bar are all excellent. 

Listen....I like Mexican food and I was skeptical when I walked in because no one does Mexican cuisine better than Los Angeles or San Diego; however, this food was filling, flavorful, and authentic. 

I have been here almost once a week since and it has become one of my week night staples."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place has some of the best tacos in Santa Barbara! So many different meat options but it's a nice, simple menu. The gorditas and tortas are also really good, but I'm still trying to get through some of the other menu items since everything looks so amazing! Only thing I wish they could improve on is the salsa bar. I don't see much variety and would like to have more options there. Otherwise Cuernavaca is amazing and definitely a place you must visit when coming through town!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Great food. Beso de monja and for a chon were awesome. Meat has a roasted seasoned flavor that is super tasty. Large portions...3 dishes filled up 4 people.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Cuernavaca is a GREAT new place on the SB food scene.  The food was very good putting them at or near the top of the leader board for walk up mexican in Santa Barabara, and that is a very tough league.   The staff was diligent, setting is new.  the only downside is the size of the space... too small and once the word gets out on this place it will be very hard to get one of the few tables.   We had chicken sopas and a taco al pastor. The shell on the sopa was done perfect and it was delivered quickly."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great food, nice restaurant, friendly staff. The salsa is amazing!! Will be back to try other stuff on the menu."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Stopped here for a quick lunch before going shopping for the afternoon. Nice clean place with good lighting so very welcoming. We both ordered the carnitas. I asked for cheese to be added and they were very accommodating. They come pretty plain but have a topping bar to dress them up as you want. I really liked that they grilled the carnitas, it gave it a little crunch and crispiness you don't normally get. Good tasting tacos and even though they don't make their own tortillas you can tell they are very fresh and they are heated. 

Very popular place with a mix of locals, workers and tourists. They even have a parking lot. They are about 2-3 blocks from Nordstrom. FYI no chips for us gringos."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Pretty authentic in my opinion. I got the veggie taco #1 and a chorizo taco. The veggie taco was awesome if you're don't feel like eating meat. The cheese they used in the taco was not American. Delicious. The chorizo taco was good as well, not really all that greasy!! A clean and flavorful taco. The salsa were all good BUT the hot was too hot for me."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"We had sopes de tinga, gorditas, rolled tacos, and a chicken burrito. Everything was delicious, probably the best tasting tinga I've had."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,Not bad tacos. Average prices. No beer available. You may have to park on the street and walk a little ways to get here.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"My god do these guys make good burritos!  I wish they opened up one where I'm from in San Jose.  Now I've had a lot of burritos from a lot of places, but the care in preparation like the toasting of the shell, the fresh meat, the perfect rice, sour cream, the excellent beans, and super fresh avocado set this place apart.  No it's not fancy stuff here, but the quality is off the charts!  Excellent!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Never had tacos this good- authentic- smells heavenly as you approach. I'm a vegetarian and only ate the potato and mushroom tacos and they were just fantastic. Wish I lived closer!?
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great service, delicious food, convenient location coming from 101 :)
Driving from Santa Cruz to SD...two great burrito places, and found this place as a pit stop. Excellent! I will remember this exit for next trip!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"More like 4.5 stars. 

One of the places that I can truly say is worth going to in Santa Barbara. 

The place doesn't provide much seating. So I would probably always do take out.  The salsa bar had a good variety, 3 types of salsa, limes, pico de gallo, etc.  

I had the tacos with al pastor. chorizo, and carnitas.  All of them were good.  I really liked the fact the the taco with al pastor had a chuck of pineapple on it. I don't usually like fruit in my food but it blended perfectly with the al pastor. Also had the Taco Cubano, which was a pretty big sandwich. The flavor and texture worked really well.  

Food was good, but just in FYI, one taco with carnitas was a little dry and the Taco Cubano was a little greasy.  Definitely worth checking out. I would go back. 

Low cost with pretty high quality food. Service was straightforward and pleasant."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Delicious food ! Bad service from the cashier though she has an attitude but the food was so good it made up for her attitude and still got this place 5/5
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is a great find! No frill taqueria. I wish they open in the Bay Area soon. I googled what alembre means before ordering, but I also think since I always like Mexican food, I am up for anything. No regret whatsoever. They also have great selection of tasty and fresh salsa. The lengua taco is great with the sauteed onion available in their salsa bar."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Carne. Asada. Burrito. (with salsa verde poured on every bite). So good it might have you singing hymns. 

The location is a bit off the beaten State Street path, so it may take some looking to get to, but the journey is worth it. In the cool, spacious, mural-laden dining room, the mood is laid-back and clean as can be. 

The staff here is always friendly, if a little fast and willing to get orders out as quickly as possible. They appreciate the tips, and it's deserved, especially considering this is about the best price for a high-quality burrito as you're gonna get in Santa Barbara. 

Definitely a recommended spot for the food alone, and especially for that price."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,El fortachon. Nuff said.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I happened to chance by this place while looking for another Mexican place to eat at. I'm so glad I did, and make my way over here at least once a month. My the food here is amazing.

After my first few visits, I've settled down for always getting their Taco Cubano. It's amazing. The milanesa they put in there (a breaded cutlet) is absolutely phenomenal and adds a nice crunch to your bite. The food is presented as a stack of tortillas and a scramble of meat, cheese, and grilled onions, topped with avocado slices and a nice large slice of a tomato. The green and red really makes the dish look appetizing and it smells great. I always leave feeling stuffed with great tasting food here.

Their salsa bars is one of my favorites in SB. The spicy avocado salsa is so great. It makes you sweat and cry and pant, but it's so satisfying. Piling heaps of onions and cilantro directly onto my plate is one of my guilty pleasures.

Even though there are a great many Mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara, I'm never hesitant to come here. Highly recommended."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The street tacos here are on point! Great for a quick bite in the afternoon. If my husband and I are out with the dog we often bring him with and take the picnic table out front. The service is fast--we're usually in and out in 15 minutes--and I love that the menu has so much more than just street tacos, so if you're in a group there are options. I tend to keep it simple, so my favorites are the al pastor and chicken."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Stopped here for lunch during a road trip with some friends.  Solid, simple tacos... the chicken and al pastor were my favorites.   The mild salsa was on the hot side of things, though... taste before you just go crazy with it.   

Would definitely be back."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"So good I came here two days in a row! The chicken taquito plate (three taquitos, rice, beans, $8.50) was great. The chicken enchiladas verdes plate (three enchiladas, rice, beans, $12) was AMAZING, definitely going to be craving that until I go again. My husband had the steak burrito ($6.85), the steak was very soft and the burrito overall was very good. Great prices and great flavor, can't wait to go back!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place is really good the salsa bar is awesome the place is nice and clean and then prices even  better....
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Great Mexican food with good prices! The tortas are my fav and the salsa is excellent. Will be coming here more when stopping by Santa Barbara. My girlfriend also loves the horchata :)
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"One of a couple of good Mexican places in town. Everything is delicious and prepared fresh. Food is great, lots of meat, and prices are amazing."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Cuernavaca is one of my favorite places to eat!  Their vegetarian alambre, made with sauteed mushrooms and pineapple, cheese, and avocado, is absolutely phenomenal.  The service is surprisingly fast and the food is delicious.  I highly recommend Cuernavaca."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I love their gorditas de prensado which I couldn't even find in LA. 
Parking is hard, though when I pass by and I see a spot I stop for a gordita."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"There web show great pic of the food in the menu  we where on our way to LA and stop for some tacos, and they were nasty no flavor at all. Worst Mexican food I ever had to top it off the tortillas were not hand made liars. We saw they were in the bag and microwave I don't recommend this place."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Got two alambres to go, El Fortachon and chicken, total came to $22. Kind of steep and sadly, that's the norm here now.

The place is very clean and the guy at the register was very friendly.

Salsa bar is pretty weak with only three variations and no pico de gallo. The food was ok, very fresh tasting but no love. Later on I created something with the leftovers and I was very pleased with that. Oh...the tortillas are hand made and tasty.

With so many Mexican joints in town I'm not sure that I'll return here any time soon."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Exactly what I want from a taqueria. Not the best blow me away tacos, but very good. 

$7.35 got me 3 tacos and a Mexi-Coke bottle. Top it all off at their salsa bar. 

The pastor and chuleta tacos were really good- the lengua taco was excellent. The shredded chicken tacos looked really good on someone else's plate. 

Order at the counter, grab some salsas and toppings at the salsa bar, sit at one of the 8 tables til your # is called, type of place."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"The food was good, but not amazing.  I liked it and would be fine eating there again, but wouldn't go out of my way."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"What a find. This was a new Mexican cuisine for me, with ingredients mixed together and served with tortillas for wrapping. It was delicious. The place is small, you order at the counter, and the clientele seems to be almost exclusively Mexican. This s great inexpensive food."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,My tacos were delicious and they were a fair price. It's relatively quiet during the day but they have their occasional lunch rush so I suggest calling in for an order. It's one of the few good mexican food places in Santa Barbara so I definitely recommend!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place was awesome and super impressive. We ate a ton of el pastor, pollo asada and carne asada tacos. They were all delicious and very authentic to traditional Mexican street tacos; the only ingredients were meat and maybe some pineapple in the el pastor....they serve limes, cilantro and onion on the side (as they should!), and they had a legit salsa bar. We would have seriously eaten here every day while we were in Santa Barbara had we known about this place earlier!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great food, nice people! Come here at least 2-3 times a week to get my taco fix. I have a medical issues that causes me to be picky about my food so I keep tabs on the places that I can go to and easily get things the way I need without it being a hassle or having to explain. They have always been very kind and accommodating to my sometimes weird request of several different side orders so that I can put things together the way I need to myself. I am so happy to be adding them to my list of lunchtime favorites. Great Job!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Every time I make my yearly trek down to Santa Barbara I get treated to some pretty fancy restaurants by my darling in-laws which is always fun...but the truth is I'm a simple girl, with simple tastes. And this simple girl wanted authentic Mexican food and I found it here. My husband and I both ordered three al pastor tacos each, and man, I think we could've had more! The meat was perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection. Their salsa bar had all the trimmings for a great taco. They have salsa, but they also have chopped onion, radishes and cilantro for the ""taco purist"" out there. I ordered an horchata to drink and it was just as tasty as everything else. I am definitely making this a place to return to on this visit and on my next visit down!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"So good I don't want to write a review because I don't want more people going there! Excellent salsa, awesome alambres (like fajitas, but with cheese too), and a great taco selection. The staff is nice too."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Great place the torta Cubana and the tacos were amazing would highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for some authentic and great tasting Mexican
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Oh wow! The best in Santa Barbara! Their carne azada torta was huge and so delicious, a layer of refried beans, steak strips, avocado and cheese! Crazy good. The grilled shrimp tacos are the real deal. Hard not to order EVERYTHING on the menu, especially when it's all under $10!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place has amazing tacos! The tortillas are homemade which makes the tacos taste even better! I had Asada and my fiancé had tripe and chorizo we both raved about how well the meats were seasoned!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I gave them 5  
The food was great... I had 2 tacos 2 gorditas and let me tell you.. it was good ..the meat (wow) they must have just cooked it."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"By far the best authentic Mexican food in town. The salsas are out of the world and the potato tacos  are to die for. Another one of my favorites is Mushroom tacos. Plenty of options for vegetarians. Jamaica, horchata, tamarindo are all really good. 

 Won't recommend for a large group of people though, seating is limited."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Cheap, fresh and great tacos! Salsa bar without nachos, what a pity! Tried their al pastor buritto, el dorado, add guac and HEAVEN!!! Tacos of buche, lengua, shrimp and tripas were all excellent!! What a gem =)"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Some of the best tacos and town and that's hard with all of the competition. Plenty of seating and options I'd pick this taco place over a dozen others
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great, affordable Mexican food in Santa Barbara! Who knew that exists?

I was introduced to this place by a friend. It's located in a very cramped corner plaza, and there weren't that many parking spots, even though it wasn't super busy. When I first entered, I was immediately let down because I thought it was a very small store with just two tables crammed to the side, but I soon found out there's a separate room to the left with plentiful seating. The restaurant as a whole was surprisingly clean, down to the restrooms. 

I was told the tortas here are life-changing, and while I'm sad to report they are *not* life changing, they're still pretty freaking delicious. I got the al pastor for my meat selection, and it was very flavorful. The melted cheese brought everything together, and I love how they were pretty generous with the avocados too. For an extra kick, their medium green sauce is delicious. Apply generously. 

Worried I wouldn't be full, I also ordered a Beef Stew taco. Just by eyeballing it, it seems you only get an average amount of meat, unlike Lily's Tacos, but the taste was great. The cubes of stewed beef were ridiculously tender and flavorful, and was a party in my mouth when paired with the (you guessed it) green salsa. It's also competitively priced, so I'd highly recommend!

Affordable prices, clean environment, fast service, and great food. 5 Stars."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"mexican food that hits the spot.

el fortachon plate - soft tortillas, filling mix of carnitas, etc...and avocado
asada burrito

the salsa bar has several different salsas. there is a smokey red salsa. there is a green one that is EXTREMELY HOT with habanero. man, it was delicious!! be careful with it though. load up on radishes for calming your tongue. (and a cilantro salsa that i didn't taste)

el fortachon plate was a make your own taco plate. you put as much filling in the tortilla as you want, salsa, squeeze of lime, and top it with a slice of avocado.

asada burrito was the kind that i was craving also.

there is seating in the room where you order your food and another room of tables inside. they have flat screen tvs mounted on the walls playing soccer games. 

i highly recommend cuernavaca to satisfy your taco, burrito, quesadilla, sopes desires. better than the other ones we have tried (can't remember the names and too lazy to look them up..haha)"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Very tasty. And pretty darn authentic.

I've had their suadero, tripa, and lengua tacos and they were delicious.
Their Gorditas and Tortas are very good as well.

Also, everything in their salad bar is very fresh. I highly recommend the green sauce! (I like to put both the red and green sauce on my tacos)

A solid 4 stars from me. Prices are reasonable too."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This was quite the little find on my most recent trip to SB. Totally authentic, like my grandma used to make. Menu in Spanish.  I got my husband hooked on their horchata!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Beats the heck out of food in Las Vegas. Got here on the recommendation of the clerk at Ralph's. 
You won't be disappointed. 
I had the Alambres Taco Cubano."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"I am SUPER disappointed with Cuernavaca.  No more pico de gallo in their salsa bar - I asked for it and was told ""We only make it on weekends.""  That's crazy! Now I will be going back to Los Agaves and El Sitio!!

One of my favorite places to go for Mexican food.  It's not pretending to be anything it's not, and I dig that.  

Favorites are: al pastor tacos (yuuum!!!), steak gordita (so bomb!), alambres (sp?) normal, and their beans & rice are delish!

Salsa bar used to be good!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place deserves 5 stars.  The food is amazing and the salsa are very authentic.  The people at the walk up window could smile and pretend that they care even once in a while.  I would highly recommend anything on the menu.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,In Santa Barbara for the weekend and decided to try this place out! I have to say it's pretty darn good! Food is delicious and place is nice & clean! Def. will be coming here again on my next trip back to S.B
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Randomly came across this spot after we spent the morning hunting for seaglass. It was amazing! 

We arrived 10 min after it opened and there were already people in there gobbling up their burritos-- salsa running down their chins, noses sniffling from all the delicious spice...no shame! 

Ordered the carne asada burrito and asked to add onions and cilantro (they didnt have pico). The burrito came with rice, beans, meat, and cheese. It was heaven! The rice was fluffy and well seasoned, there wasnt an overload of beans to make up for the lack of meat,well flavored meat, and cheese...everyone loves cheese. 

They gave us a few to go salsa containers to pack up our salsas and we loaded up with the hot green one. Do it! 

We start walking to our car and wouldnt ya know...theres a dive right next door! They welcomed us in (food and all) and even the bartender raved about the clean restaurant next door."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Listen. We hosted a 10-person, 10-burrito double blind taste test of what we believed to be the top contenders for Best Burrito in Santa Barbara, and Cuernavaca won by a landslide. Their chicken burrito -- with no modifications -- won by a full 100pts with a standard deviation was a FRACTION of the other contenders. 

Unspeakably delicious tacos (al pastor, veggie #1, chicken, carnitas) are also ""a thing"" they do here.  And when I say ""a thing"", what I mean is, they ship perfection in their sleep. 

People are going to tell you that Lily's serves fierce competition for this taco house -- and they're not wrong. But Cuernavaca wins hand over foot (is that the right expression) -- every single time."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best Tacos In town!! Cant beat the Al Pastor meat with pineapple on the top, hot salsa, cilantro, unions, squirt of lime, and a big mouthwatering jaw receiving its first bite! Stop by ! Way Better than Lily's Tacos! the only thing that does suck about both joints, is that they chose to close the shop on Tuesday! come on now!! Tuesday stands for TACOS!!!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Bottom Line: Yet another legit Mexican spot you will NOT regret visiting

Lets see - lets check off the boxes -

- Spanish on the menu before English
- A TV in the corner blaring something from Telemundo
- Very few gringos around....

this place had all of the signs of a great Mexican spot....so we ordered a burrito and some taquitos and enjoyed!  
    The food was great and the salsa bar is great.... pretty much everything was great!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,First time here and I had the Carne asada Torta and it was yummy! The only bad this is they had no chips to go with this amazing salsa bar that they have. Also I really wish they would switch to soda fountain and not soda by the can.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Here's what you do: order 2 al pastor tacos, 2 asada tacos, 2 chorizo tacos, and 1 chicken taco. 

The end. 

PS the asada is better than the al pastor."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"This is the worst place ever for tacos. The carne asada was the cheap steak not skirt steak. Tacos de lengua the meat was just boiled noflavor. The al pastor tacos were also terrible. Cheap meat and no flavor. Just red coloring. 
Very disappointed. They were expensive and not worth the money. The burrito de asada was just as bad. To be fair we didnt buy anything else but be warned. I gave them one star because you cant write a review for zero stars."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Who in the world is closed on a Tuesday!?!? OK I'm back and the food is delicious. Having an enjoyable lunch with my parents. They really enjoyed the food and salsas. Surprisingly.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Stop here on the way back to Salinas, Ca and I gotta say by far the best gorditas I have ever had !!! Extremely delicious. The service is so fast I wasn't even done getting salsa from their salsa bar when they were calling my number. This is what mexican food should taste like. Delicious, will be going back .
Also get the horchata!!!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Fantastic Mexican food. Visiting for the night. Wanted to get away from the crowds of State st. Took the 5min walk up to this place and it didn't disappoint. Sopes where excellent. FYI there are some places to sit inside but it's more of a walk up and order spot.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is SOOO GOOD! Favorite Mexican place in Santa Barbara! You can put anything you want in a burrito like mushrooms bell peppers avocado pineapple, which is great for vegetarians!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Small counter service traditional Mexican food that is phenomenal. And the salsa bar equality delicious. Totally recommend the  alambres. We were just passing through by can't wait to find an excuse to pass through again!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is one of the few taquerias I have ever been to that finds a perfect balance of keeping it authentic enough to attract the native-born Mexicans, and Americanized enough to attract the gringos. It's the perfect SB taqueria! The meat is really tasty, tortillas taste like their home-made, and the salsas are fresh and picante. The employees are very friendly, it's clean, quick, and affordable. I wish they could put a bench or small table outside during lunch, because it does get crowded, and I often grab my burrito and sit on the curb."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Walked in, read the menu, saw a bunch of words that I don't know, and I knew that I came across the right place.


I had to Google everything on the menu beforehand to get a sense of what I wanted to order. I ended up getting the 3 chorizo sopas, 1 pork gordita, and 1 al pastor burrito. The sopas were soooooo good. The bread base was the best part as it was fried but not to a point that it's hard (actually, think about the shell for a taco bells chalupa, this is like that but even better). The chorizo was very well seasoned and not too oily like how most place makes them. The gordita was pretty similar to the sopas and also was very good. The burrito was okay. A little too much rice for my taste, and I ended up having to eat it with the salsa that they provided. 

But yeah, too bad I'm not a local, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting sb."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,I love love love this place. We recently moved to the Santa Barbara area and we were on the hunt for great mexican food when we found this place. It is amazing. The tacos are incredible. I get the carne asada tacos and my husband gets the veggie tacos which have mushrooms and peppers. We have brought every guest we have had so far to Cuernavaca and not a single one has been disappointed. Love this place!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Excellent food and very traditional.  It's one of those places where you order and pay at the counter and then go back up when it's ready.  

Both our meals were very tasty.

Very limited parking lot, so you may have to park in the street."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Amazing, authentic Mexican food. I don't write reviews very much but this place definitely deserves 5 stars. Passing through on the way to San Francisco and was not disappointed with the alambres. If you like Mexican food, go here"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"1. The salsa bar is not consistent; the evening I was there, only two options were available (red and green).

2. There is no table service. You order at the counter, and grab your food when they call a number.

3. There are several types of tacos including old favorites and some new types I had not seen like a sauted/simmered beef option that was delicious.

4. The tacos are on the small side (or I guess, they are normal), so three per person is a good snack.

5. I am definitely coming back for the burritos :)"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Always great food and service, their avocado sauce is the best for the tacos! Love this place food always fresh and very fair prices!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I was going to give it 4 stars for being a tiny restaurant and crowded, but I can get past that..  Ingredients here are really fresh!  One of the most unique tortas I've ever had, as far as the bread goes (really flaky crust). try it with al pastor meat in it.
I"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"As someone who has been eating authentic (and inauthentic) Mexican food for almost 30 years, this is one of my favorite spots in Santa Barbara. It's always a solid choice. Their asada tortas are delicious and their tinga sopes are unsurpassable. In a town where food is severely overpriced, Cuernavaca comes in clutch with $6 and $8 menu items. The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and the food comes out fairly quickly. Cannot recommend this place enough."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great tacos and salsa bar, good beans and rice too. I usually get the al pastor, and am happy every time. 

Its located downtown, and the dining area has expanded. Overall I'd say it is a clean, convenient, and tasty Mexican joint!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is great.  Clean dining areas, friendly staff, delicious salsas, and outstanding succulent meats.  I got the Cuban tacos and they were very flavorful.  It was a huge portion and I loved it the whole way through.  One of the best lunch experiences I have had in Santa Barbara."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Yummy, we happened to come across this place in our way home from Solvang. Loved the gorditas! My daughter had the quesadilla with bell peppers and potatoes, she loved it!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Really delicious! You know it's legit when everyone there was speaking Spanish. The guy who took our order was really nice. We got the El Fortachon and Taco Cubano plates. I'm not really sure how they were different as they both included a ton of different types of meats, cheese, avocado, etc. We loaded them up with all the goodies at the salsa bar and were in heaven.

Also, everything was really clean. The kitchen looked clean and the bathroom was nice, which is always a plus! The seating is very simple, but comfortable enough."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place was amazing.  Pretty unassuming in downtown Santa Barbara but the tacos, salsas and alambres were out of this world."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best place to eat tacos at Santa Barbara , CA I loved this place all meats are excellent !! Asada and pastor the best !!!! I highly recommend this place!!!  definitely coming back!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I had meant to take a pic of the food I ate, but when my number was called I just went into auto and demolished the plate. I was happily surprised at the set up of he plate. They separated the meat and cheese into a pile and it was up to you to assemble... It was ALOT of food for a very decent price. Will be back for round 2 real soon."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,The torta cubana is the best thing I've ever eaten outside my home. Everything else was exceptional but the Cubana is out of this world.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Truly excellent food. Really well priced. Self serve atmosphere was only downside. Well worth the stop. As a Canadian, there were lots of different  new dish options than the typical stuff we get. Loved it!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Been here a few times now and have to say this is one of the best, if not the best Mexican restaurant in town.   Great service, consistent food and convenient location. 

So, what to get?  My favorite is the Chili Relleno burrito with rice, beans, cheese and yummy chilies.   Second favorite is the chicken burrito. 

When you go, grab the salsa from the salsa bar. The avocado based salsa is super yum-o and the diced onions/cilantro really adds some depth.  The only downer is they no longer offer pico de gallo. 

So, when are you coming here for lunch?"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,No matter what time of day it is Cuernavaca is the jam! You can't go wrong here and the service is great. I highly recommend checking it out.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Yum is all I can say! This place is bomb.com! I stopped her with my daughter on our way back from San Jose. So delicious and priced well.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,The best tacos Ive had! Was visiting recently and stopped in here to eat and I must say the tacos were GREAT..... The shrimp taco was hands down my Fave. The salsa bar was great too :)
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Their tacos cubano are amazing. Crack tacos. I used to come all the time, but then I realized that I never order the less-unhealthy dishes, because the cubano is way, way too delicious. Now it's one of my favorite treats in SB."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Thankful SB had this restaurant open! We were in need of a good, reasonably priced Mexican Restaurant & Cuernavaca is that.. So fresh & flavorful, salsas are on point! Love it, because it's all homemade; they def do not take any short cuts. I hope they continue to make the plates fresh, not like other places in SB that you can tell it was pre-made & heated up. 
I recommend it all, the sopes are the bomb & its hards to find a good sope:)"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best al pastor in Santa Barbara. I have tried the tacos and burrito so far and both have been outstanding.

 Great flavor to the hot salsa at the salsa bar."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Found this little gem on my way to work if you love Mexican food come here. Take out is definitely available and it's fast service. I always order a Asada torta and it taste amazing specially if you love avocado in it unlike other places you don't have to pay extra.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Everything I have tried here has been delicious! From the carne asada tacos to the al pastor, lengua and everything else. I highly recommend trying the alambre. The carne asada burritos are also delicious and they toast the tortilla as the finishing touch. Everyone there is friendly and this place is definitely my favorite taco place in Santa Barbara!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Comida Autentica Mexicana, We had the Alembre and some Tongue tacos with 2 Gorditas de RequesonDam delicious"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"three words: 

bomb dot com! You can't go wrong dining here. Authentic, clean, and good ol' fashion mexican food! 

DELICIOUS!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Yummy food, and relatively easy menu. Lot's of similar items. 

Good: 
The chicken alambre. 
Little tacos are good for simple fuss free food.
Salsa bar is top shelf. 

Bad:
Salsas are better then the food at times
Portions aren't always consistent.  
The register guys aren't the friendliest. 
Parking can be a joke. 

Recap: Tasty in a random place."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"A hidden gem in SB. Great carne asada wet burrito. Service was quick and they have extra seating in the back. The parking lot is small, but the food is very good."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Awesome. Do not expect chain restaurant or cheese sauce. It is fast food style ala carte with no frills but fast service and the kind of food you should expect in a Mexican restaurant.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I would definitely go again. 
The food was great and the pricing is perfect. Everytime we visit with my family the place is nice and clean at both dinning areas.
However, the gentleman on the register always seems to be in a grumpy mood.
The true rating would be 4.5"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I love their carnitas tacos and their green salsa is to die for! Perfect amount of spice to it. Their tacos are the best in town. When you grow up eating authentic Mexican food, it's hard to give ""Mexican"" restaurants a good review. Cuernavaca is better than any other Mexican restaurants in S.B. You will NOT be disappointed ;)"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Ordered al pastore and chorizo tacos along with el  fortachon plate. The tastes were creative and good.  This is well worth a side trip when in Santa barbara
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Saw the mixed reviews but decided to try it anyways since it was near a few places we were headed, and I must say I'm really happy we did. Super fresh and tasty, staff was amazing, helpful and friendly. Salsa bar was great as well and the prices were super reasonable. For $18 (including tip) we got 3 tacos, a quesadilla, and three sopas. All of which were AMAZING. Only thing that was a bit annoying was that they didn't have any pico, girl said we only have it on the weekends."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Came here with the family for a quick Mexican food dinner and I had 2 carne asada chalupas. They were more filling than I had anticipated and I probably could have been just fine with one. But for $3.50 each, I thought they would be small. What was in it you ask? It was one deep fried (and looked homemade) thick tortilla cut in 2 to make a sandwich, refried beans, carne asada, cheese, lettuce and cream. The meat was a little tough, but again, for $3.50, it's a deal."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Really some of the best ""street tacos"" anywhere north or south of the border, and SB has no shortage of good taco choices.  Seriously delicious.  I think I've tried them all but my favorites are lengua, carne asada, and al pastor.  Toss a little onions and cilantro on top, maybe squeeze a little lemon,  and pour on your choice of their excellent salsas!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Two al pastor burritos with added avocado was just what the doctor ordered, literally. My boyfriend wasn't feeling well during our trip to SB and always wants something spicy and these burritos (plus their hot sauces) hit the spot. The red salsa is very flavorful and very spicy! I preferred the yellowish one on mine. Still has a kick but not quite like the green and the red. The rice was super flavorful and the meat was cooked to perfection. Would definitely recommend! 

My one 'complaint' (if you'd call it that) was that the burritos came cut in half - not necessary.

And the horchata was delicious!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"All I have to say is this is hands down the best Mexican food we have ever had. Try anything...seriously it doesn't matter. It's all so very good! The rice, not so great but far better than any other place I've had it. Refried beans are with getting too."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This is probably my new favorite Mexican food place in Santa Barbara. The food is great and the service is excellent. Everyone there was extremely friendly 10/10 would come again.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is fantastic. The food is delicious, portions are large and its inexpensive. Just a heads up that the dining room is pretty small, so you might have trouble finding a seat if it's busy."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Solid. We split the carne asada burrito and it was pretty solid. Also tried the pollo, carne asada, and al pastor tacos. Quick and fast service. The best thing is their salsa bar- fresh cilantro, lemons (no limes perhaps because of the shortage), three types of salsa, radishes, carrots, and onions. Check it out for a quick lunch spot."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Taken hereby some friends.I have to admit the food was really good. I had the  Sopa's which I enjoy so much. I also tasted my friends taco,big flavor!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Food: Good.
Shrimp and cheese taco - looks simple, but tastes yummy and flavorful. 
Chicken burrito - good, but not particularly memorable. 

Atmosphere: If you're looking for something quick and casual, and off State St this is a good place to go."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I had the carne asada and al pastor tacos.  They were delicious!  The portions were plentiful.  The price point was good.  The staff was friendly, courteous, and professional.  The kitchen and dining area appeared clean and well maintained.  Parking is a little sparse, but you can always park on DeLaVina.  The dining area has good ambiance but it's a taqueria, so I wasn't expecting much.  There are about 6 tables.  The dining area is small.  But you're going for their excellent food right?  So just take it to go and enjoy the beautiful outdoors!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best, most consistent tacos for an affordable price in Santa Barbara. The tortas are also great. Don't expect a service-oriented environment -- although the larger dining area is welcome. Look at the menu, choose some tacos, and then order. Get some salsa, eat and enjoy. I do often.

The salsas are very good and fresh, and the al pastor is my favorate. The torta cubana is my go to when I need a large amount of varied meats on a tasty bun. And they have lengua and tripa if you want to go there."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"My chicken tinga gordita was pretty amazing, taco was ok, my boyfriend did not love his torta though. I would say if you come definitely get the gordita!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Randomly stopped here getting off the 101 with empty bellies and a grumpy baby. What a serendipitous find. I got a chicken burrito with guacamole, fiancé had crispy chicken taquitos with fresh queso fresco and crunchy lettuce. We also got 3 tacos to share which were equally impressive (adobada was best). We were given plenty of delicious spicy salsa (they're not stingy like some places.) The service was friendly and fast, and the bathrooms clean (which always means the kitchen is too.) And best of all, super cheap. Will definitely be back."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Excellent little hole in the wall! Yes parking isn't the greatest, Yes there aren't very many tables, but this shouldn't take away from the food quality people! I'm a SB local of 40yrs, have had my share of all other so called ""authentic"" mexican food spots in town and i'm beyond satisfied with Cuernavaca's food, service and cleanliness! I am a fan of Lilly's tacos, if i'm ONLY in the mood for tacos. SuperRica is another one, except for its super highly priced and nothing to really brag about except for their ""raja taco"", I literally have not yet had it better anywhere else in town or out of town. El Bajio (on Milpas) eh... pretty good, but I'd rather park a block away and feast at Cuernavaca.

Highly recommend it, Enjoy!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The tacos here are to die for: 3 kinds of veggie tacos and such succulent shrimp! The 3 salsas were also each super. After the first round, we had to go back for more... I can't wait to eat here again."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Food was delicious and cheap. Service was good and the place was clean. I highly recommend this place.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I was beyond happy when I found out a place with the name Cuernavaca since that's the city I was born. I nearly cried when I saw their menu, it brought back memories of foods I hadn't eaten in decades and the sentiment grew strong when I taste it. The food is not only authentic but extremely delicious. The owner and her son were very welcoming and for a moment I felt at home. I will definitely come back for more and highly recommend it."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I stopped by Ceuernavaca this afternoon after getting an excellent coffee at The French Press a couple blocks away.

It's setup in a traditional taqueria style: big menu over the cash register, order at the counter. You will quickly realize the menu is in spanish. This is a good sign (pun intended). As I recall, the menu features mainly tacos and Alambre (fajita-esque dish).

I was tempted to try try the alambre, especially after seeing a fellow customer's dish that was topped with avocado slices and accompanied by a generous portion of tortillas.

However, the $1.60 price tag on the tacos was too tempting to pass up. I took faith in the recommendation of my fellow Yelpians and ordered the al pastor. Four tacos total: two al pastor, one asada, one chicken.

The asada and chicken tacos were decent, but the al pastor tacos were excellent. The meat was flavorful, and not too salty (as another Yelper commented), and it came with a pineapple wedge that complimented the meat flavors perfectly. 

I also got an horchata, which was less than stellar. Maybe this is what a true authentic horchata tastes like, but I wasn't a fan. There was something weird about it that I can't pinpoint.

Anyhow, my overall experience was definitely positive. The al pastor tacos were so good that when I finished my four tacos, I was kind of sad it was over, and I wanted another four tacos.

Also, this is a great place to go if you are dining alone. It's casual, fast, cheap, and tasty. 

I give Cuernavaca my full endorsement. 4/5 stars at the very worst."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Went with some friends that had never been and my hubby; we all walked away very satisfied and making plans to return soon!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place has the best tortas! Love the asada one. The flan  is amazing! It's the traditional Mexican flan not that jello shit.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Tasty carnitas and Al Pastor.  Great price.  Horchata marvelosa.  Great spot for a quality quick bite
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best plate of cheese enchiladas I've ever had in my life. We also got shrimp tacos, potato taco, and the chicken enchiladas. Everything was amazing. I from SoCal, went to school in LA, visited San Diego several times. This place stands above the rest. I will come back to Santa Barbara for this restaurant, alone. I'm still thinking about it lol"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"To me wow wow so much meat for 1.60$  the taquitos are Bomb. For the long weekend to Santa Barbara n this little place wow the food is so great .. Only thing is the cashier he looks like he mad need to smile a little but defenely recommended to everyone .. Compas de Santa Barbara caigale a estos taquitos shaaauuuu ... 
NO PASA NADA"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is a small place but the food was excellent. And there prices are good to. I got five tacos 1 el pastor,2 chorizo, 1 chicken, and 1 asada. All for just 9 bucks. The portions were pretty generous for the price. And the service was good to. I will definitely go back."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Top notch taco joint.  Don't be mistaken though - this is pretty much a high-end taco truck in an actual store front.  That said - delicious and a nice reprieve from the endless fancy meals that i'm sure you'll indulge in while you are in SB.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great tacos try veggie ones so yummy and fresh. Clean reasonable salsa bar  
Today I had Torta Cubano 
Wonderful flavors the marinated pork and avocado combo were California/Cubano
Roll toasted perfectly 
Great flan. Perfect texture and very fresh"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Excellent authentic Mexican food with great service. I'll definitely be back when I come into town. Highly recommend the El Fortachon.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great service, awesome food and a clean environment. Staff looks happy and the salsas are to die for. You must eat here!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,I would love to give this place a 5 star but their customer service is not that great! The food is delicious but a lot of the times the poor customer service makes you not want to go again! Their tacos are probably the best in town!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I love this place! They certainly have some of the best tacos I've ever had, and I also love the alhambres. All the other items I've tried were also very good. They have surprisingly good vegetarian options and they're always very friendly. Even though the place gets busy they're very quick."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Get. The. Torta. Cubana.

Carrillo is one of the busiest streets in downtown Santa Barbara, yet Cuernavaca has gotten away with being a bit of a hidden gem in plain sight. At dinner time on a Friday, the line was just starting to pile up, and there was no doubt that it was the kind of place where the locals know best. For less than $20, we ordered three tacos and a torta cubana.

I have never felt such an urge to marry a sandwich. The thick layers of avocado, marinated pork, and milanesa, in conjunction with the ham, tomato, and cheese, really made for the best dang sandwich I've had in a long time. Not only did it make for a beautiful stacked sandwich photo opp, it also was the first sandwich I thought was well worth the $8.95 price tag in a long time. 

Surprisingly, the tacos were the most disappointing part. I ordered a lengua taco to accompany my torta cubana and was not impressed. While the lengua was soft, it was incredibly fatty and chewy, which I was unaware could even happen when the tongue is a muscle. There was too much liquid, which soaked through and tore my tortillas in half. Adding onions helped with the textural problem, but didn't salvage it.

The interior was clean and had ample seating. There was a decent salsa bar (no free chips, sadly) as well. We noticed that the lighting was kinda funky inside. Although dark and almost romantic, the lights there were shone directly down on the tables, causing us to squint to make eye contact. But hey, no lighting's going to stop me from eating another torta cubana."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Tried the gorditas, tacos, sopes, alambre etc. Everything is bomb. The agua de melon is the best."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Service is fast and no nonsense. Taco Cubano alambres is very tasty. Granted I added onions, cilantro, radishes and pico de gallo from their salsa bar. Hey, I like fresh crunch with my meat. Everything (salsas, tortillas) tasted great! Hit the spot."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Excellent food, lots of seating in back and great salsas. Probably the best deal was the alambre plates. There's so much food that I had enough left over after I was full to have a whole other meal. I will definitely be coming back. If you're in a rush tho I'd suggest you call ahead."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place had everything I could ever want. The taco cubano plate was to die for because of the milanese and the al pastor was so juicy My tip is to add some flour tortillas to the corn tortillas for the perfect taco. Thank you!!!!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Tacos al pastor, they are beyond delicious. I just wish they would put more than one sliver of pineapple in it. The rubs and marinades they use are so yummy and the meat is tender. Every time I come to Santa Barbara, I make sure to stop at this taqueria. As far as I know about Mexican food, it's hole in the wall authentic."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Excellent service! I got the Taco Cubana and it was just one of the most delicious food I've ever had. Very recommended when around Santa Barbara.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Love this place!! Super inexpensive, super delicious!! Individual tacos are under $2. The chicken is juicy and amazing. They've even expanded the inside and have additional seating now!! Highly recommended, but don't forget, they're closed Tuesdays!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Stopped here on our drive back to NorCal. I ordered a veggie burrito with potatoes and a mango smoothie. I asked if the smoothie had any dairy in it, and the cashier told me he could sub water instead. I wanted something refreshing and in hindsight getting a ""fresh"" smoothie from a Mexican place was probably not the best idea. It tasted like fake sugar and water slush. Bleh. As for my burrito, I really don't like potatoes in my burritos. The cashier suggested it so I obliged. I also asked to add sour cream, and they only put a teensy bit on the bottom. They had a decent salsa bar, but WHERE ARE THE CHIPS? You just can't have a salsa bar without the chips..."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,That Cubano Torta I just ate was YUMMY!!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This was the most authentic dining experience I've had to date. I could hardly decipher the menu, and I needed help to order from a kind mexican patron in line behind me. I got the mixed grill, which was all chopped up with a few kinds of meat, onions, peppers and cheese. It came with a stack of tortillas..really fresh and super bomb. 

This place is not for your average gringo Chipotle eater, definitely a culinary leap but one worth taking! A true mexican eatery, this place is authentic! I'd love to come back and try everything on the menu."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Good service, very friendly and the atmosphere was really cool. And it is my favorite Mexican food in city."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Food was great price was decent. When you first walk in you may think it's small but there is a whole other room and a patio to it. I had a al pastor burrito and the bf had tinga sopes and Gordita was super bomb !!!!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Cuernavaca is among the taco elite of Santa Barbara. The Pastor is insane. Vegetarian options are unusually great, especially the pasilla and potato tacos. Outstanding salsas A+. I only wish this place had beers and chips, and everything would be right in the world. Keep doing you, Cuernavaca."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Great place for quick tasty authentic Mexican food. The staff is always friendly. Great salsas and Aguas Frescas. My favorite is the Gordita with chicken and avo!! The tacos hit the spot every time.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The words of Ron Burgundy ""This burrito is delicious, but it is filling"" describe the burritos from Cuernavaca. Carne asada burritos are the best thing on the menu!!

This joint is exactly what you expect from a typical taqueria... delicious food, fast service, and inexpensive. As far as this white girl can tell, Cuernavaca has some pretty authentic meals!

I love that I also don't feel like a fat lard after a burrito here... probably because they are not heavy on the queso, a plus in my book.

Salsa bar... I like to get creative and mix the red and green, more red though. And the pickled carrots make for a happy girl!

Anytime I am looking for fast food, I come here and get it to go. 

YUM."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is now my favorite taco spot in town (beating out Lilly's Tacos and 
Taqueria La Colmena).  The al pastor is shaved on demand and the shrimp tacos are a huge portion of shrimp with cheese fried onto them.  Top it all off with a horchata and you are good to go.  Even the pickled carrots at this place taste better."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Love this place! Tacos are amazing and cheap! I usually get the chicken tacos. The restaurant is small and often no inside seating so I usually get it to go. Salsa bar is great too!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place has the best tacos in California! And the prices are amazing as well! I also go with the steak tacos but I'm sure the rest are just as amazing! I was on a road trip up the coast and I just had to come back when I was coming back so the coast. If you're in the area this place is a needs to be on you're list of places to stop by! I just can't say enough about how good this place is!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best plate of cheese enchiladas I've ever had in my life. We also got shrimp tacos, potato taco, and the chicken enchiladas. Everything was amazing. I from SoCal, went to school in LA, visited San Diego several times. This place stands above the rest. I will come back to Santa Barbara for this restaurant, alone. I'm still thinking about it, one year later"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"For all the Yelpers out there that are: Gluten-free, Lactose-free, Ketogenic, Vegetarian and/or simply fans of any and all Latin foods like myself, be sure to stop in to Cuernavaca. They offer dine-in (the inside is much larger than it appears) and take-out. Note: The parking lot is limited so you may have to park on the side streets.

Interestingly enough, the menu has an unfamiliar item that you can't find at a ""traditional"" Mexican spot. Of course you can indulge yourself in the classics like tacos, tortas and gorditas. However, as the name indicates, they serve a central Mexican delicacy called an ""Alambre,"" reigning from the Morelos capital of Cuernavaca. I would compare the Alambre to a skillet where they chop ingredients and toss them into a pan to cook. Each Alambre is customizable withy our choice of meat (ham, steak, chicken, chorizo, and/or pork chop), in addition to multiple additions such as cheese, onion, bell pepper, pineapple, mushrooms and avocado. The alambre comes with homemade corn tortillas that are piping hot and ready for some taco making with chopped cilantro, onions, lime and/or salsa. Oh and did I say I truly live for their avocado salsa?! Bravo, Cuernavaca!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,I eat here 2 to 3 times per week the tacos are unreal. They have the best tacos in SB by far..
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The food was great, everything tasted fresh, they used hand made tortillas and the tinga was perfect."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is bomb! And super vegetarian friendly, you can pretty much ask for anything you want stuffed in your burrito! I love mushrooms and potatoes in mine. Best part is, it's cheap!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is a hidden gem. Probably one of the best and most authentic mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara. Anything from tacos, alambres, tortas, everything is amazing. Their flavors are spot on with anything you get. 
The place itself is not too big, but there is usually an open table. 
And I forgot to mention, they have a self serve salsa bar..."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,It is fast food style ala carte with no frills but fast service and the kind of food you should expect in a Mexican restaurant. Salsa bar was great but would of loved some chips.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Authenticity blended with value. A rare find in Santa Barbara. No line and fresh salsa bar.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Had lunch here.. really good authentic Mexican food. similar to the one located in Oxnard California. This one has a small menu but really good food (40 min drive if your up for it) Oxnard location as a pizzadilla which is to die for! so yummy!.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,Far service. Good food. Veggie taco 1 was my favorite though the carne asada was good too.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I had no idea what to order so I took a chance and tried a few things. Everything was delicious. Quick service, clean tables. Very casual and limited outdoor seating. Salsa was way too hot for me. Mexican coke made up for it. My daughter is a picky eater and would try a thing. They don't serve tortilla chips or flor tortillas so there wasn't any filler to keep her occupied."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,The sopes are really good! The menu only provides 2 meat options but they let you pick whatever meat you want. Yum!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Delicious as always! I stop by whenever I'm in Santa Bárbara. They have a great outdoor sitting area with social distancing in mind.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,One of my favorite spots in Santa Barbara. Delicious food and excellent prices. Excellent service and clean establishment. 10/10 would recommend.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Had a quesadilla plate that came with 3 good sized hand made corn tortillas .
Cuban torta good size, different sauces to choose from in salsa bar"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Just in town for a few days & friends & family raved about this place. It ain't fancy but the food is superb, nuanced and inexpensive. The place is small, so if you go during dinner time you might have to wait a few minutes because people are going to find out about Cuernavaca!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Quick, delicious, friendly, AUTHENTIC, and affordable. 

No price gauging, constantly good. We go weekly for lunch!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Does Cuernavaca need another five star review? Why not, it's a place that's easy to love. I usually get the simple tacos which are great. On a few occasions, we picked up 30 or so for a family get together. The restaurant is run by some very nice people who make you feel welcome, like you're a family friend."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Tried the Vegetarian Alambre here and liked it a lot! 
Many vegetarian options and food was very flavorful. 
Loved the flavors of pineapple :)"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Not really in the mood for a pricey mid afternoon lunch we stopped here while in Santa Barbara and loved the food as well as the service!
I went with the al pastor as well as the two veggie taco options and loved all 3 and wound get each one again.
The meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned, excellent and the best out of their meat options as my husband tried the carne asada and my son the chicken.
My  husband loved his alambres, so many flavors going on, really everything they brought out was bursting with flavor, so good.
The veggie tacos were cheesy and very satisfying, one with mushrooms and the other with potatoes, very very tasty.
The quesadillas unlike any others, really more like a large taco on flour with lettuce and cotija, not hot or with melted cheese, pass on those next time.
Great salsas, beyond excellent service and very clean restaurant as well as bathrooms, we were impressed.
Prices are fair and the food comes out quickly, I would come back every time I go to Santa Barbara from now on!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Pretty standard mexican food with friendly service and a higher price tag than I am used to. We stopped by on our way through town and my husband and I each got a variety of tacos to try their different meats, kids got a cheese quesedilla and shared an Al Pastor Torta. Overall I would recommend the Al Pastor and Carne Asada, but not really the pollo or carnitas (my favorite most other places, but they made it a whole new way that wasn't my jam). The horchata was ok, but obviously grainy and from a mix and the salsa bar was either picked over and had very little variety or maybe that is the norm. Three kinds of salsa of which 2 were green and one was an orange that was very bitter and unappealing to me. I missed any kind of tomato based topping pico or blended. The pickled carrots were pretty tasty and cilantro, raddish, and onion standard and looked same day fresh. Not sure I will go here again, but felt like overall it was pretty middle of the line and a steep cost of $42 for the simple meal we got, hubby left hungry."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place has some of the best authentic Mexican food in Santa Barbara! The ingredients are fresh and the salsa/sauces they offer in their self-serve salsa bar are also good. They've got stuff for all kinds of dietary restrictions (I'm vegan). The place is clean and the food comes out relatively fast. This place really is fantastic.

In my opinion the food is a bit overpriced, but it's Santa Barbara, so I get it. Everything is overpriced here.

The food and overall experience is good enough that I have repeatedly come back to this place, and I think that's the most telling thing."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Came here for lunch with a friend and was very pleased with the food! We sat outside under a tent, and our food came out in 5-10 minutes! 

I got 4 tacos (2 carne asada, 1 carnitas, 1 tongue) and they were all very tasty. Tacos all came with a substantial portion of meat, onions, and cilantro. It also came with two salsas - mild is a creamy green salsa and medium is a pretty spicy green chunkier salsa. My favorite was the carne asada but all were excellent. 

The bill came out to $10 including tax and tip. Excellent value and quality for the price. I wish I had a lunch place like this near where I live! 10/10 would come back here again."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,One of the few places in town where you can find tinga and it is excellent. I love the authentic quesadillas made of hand made corn tortillas. The green salsa serrano is to die for. Hope they roll out an online menu and ordering system at some point but calling in orders and paying at pick up works for now.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Excellent authentic and tasty mexican food. This is one of the best. Mouth watering salsas, easy on the wallet and huge portions. We had customized our food so that it was completely vegetarian and it was done perfectly. The ordering is through a window in the restaurant and we have to get the food once it is made. The place is like a V and has limited seating but moves fast since you can't stop eating once you start it!."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,it starts at 7$ for a burrito and goes up from there depending on the type of burrito. I had a bean rise and cheese burrito and it cost me 7$ which is a little crazy for a simple burrito without any meat but it was really yummy. They have a lot of authentic Mexican food though that is really good
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Pretty good, not my favorite place...but the tacos are cheap and tasty."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I had an amazing experience the food was delicious authentic, & inexpensive I defiantly recommend!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Great authentic street tacos! Fun atmosphere with Mexican music. Nice patio to sit on or there's indoor dining. Clean restroom.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Torta de lengua, sopes de asada y pastor. Sopes de pastor where deelicious!! Totally recommend! This was our first time here, we got lucky to find this spot"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Chicken sopes were amazing! My boyfriend got the al pastor tacos and loved them. Nice outdoor seating and friendly service. They don't serve alcohol, but Mel's bar is right next door (like pretty much attached to it) and they let us eat our food there! Super enjoyable experience."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great tacos try veggie ones so yummy and fresh. Clean reasonable salsa bar  
Today I had Torta Cubano 
Wonderful flavors the marinated pork and avocado combo were California/Cubano
Roll toasted perfectly"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,I work in downtown Santa Barbara. This is one of my go to places with my coworkers for a quick good Mexican food lunch. I always go for the Al Pastor or Carne Asada torta. But my buddies tell me that the Cuban Torta is pretty darn good as well. Good eats. Definitely recommend it.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Came in for a carne asada sope, not expecting much... and it did not disappoint. As a Hispanic/Mexican I know real Mexican cuisine, and the carne asada sope with their red sauce was really good and authentic. Enjoy!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This is by far the best torta I ever had. I really hope they can stay open during this pandemic. I went right before all of this started and hope to go back soon.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place his been 5 star worthy since it opened. I lost my way a while back, strayed to few newer taquerias in town for a while - but I'm back suckaz. The Taco Azteca is money, every time.

And of course, the salsa bar is like a litmus test for the overall awesomeness of a taco shop (duh), and their hot, jalapeño/avocado salsa is probably the best version of that saucy brew in Santa Barbara.

Don't be lame. Go get ya' some."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic mexican food from the Cuernavaca region, couldn't get enough when u lived down the street for a year. The gorditas will blow your mind almost as much as their green salsa will blow your face off!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best taqueria in town! Like Lilys, La Super Rica or Super Cucas? This place blows those out of the water. Al pastor tacos, veggie tacos, torta cubana, alhambras sabores are some of my favorites."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Decided to stop here for dinner on my day trip to Santa Barbara. Their burritos de carne asada and tacos de lengua were bomb!!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Their pastor is the way to go. Tacos, burrito and tortas. Great portions of meat in their plates for the very generous price. One my lunch spots here in town!!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This place has really solid tacos. I've eaten at many spots around town and these are up there in the top 3 places to grab some tasty street tacos.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"We were visiting from OC and found this place, great find. Food was delicious, agua de horchata was amazing and full of flavor. The salsa was flavorful and spicy loved it!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"After traveling for days we wanted a nice place, good food at a good price. And this was perfect! 

Great Mexican food, plenty to share. Staff was very friendly and told us what the items were-answering all our questions."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I came to Santa Barbara for a friends wedding, so I got into town a few days before the events just to check out the city. First night there after a long day of travel I stumbled upon this place after picking up some essentials at Ralph's and it was so worth it. They have a larger seating area that's kind of tucked away and a small seating area right next to where you order (a window in the kitchen). Super whole in the wall type of vibe so I knew the food was about to be bomb. And  it was. I got 6 tacos (3 lengua, 1 asada, 1 tripe and 1 shredded chicken) and a chicharon gordita. The gordita was good but not my favorite only bc I thought it had a little too much sauce on it - not really their fault though because I usually get the sauce on the side and the young lady taking my order asked if I wanted sauce on the gordita or just on the side, bad call on my part. The tacos were so good. Simple flavors but really hearty and well made. Lengua tacos are my favorite (hence why I got 3) but all the rest were just as good. The tripe taco was crunchy and light, both the chicken and asada were well seasoned and not at all dry. Prices are a little more expensive than on the pictures you can find on yelp but still very very reasonable. Overall 10/10 would recommend to a friend."

uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"this place!!! I was visiting Santa Barbara with my boyfriend for the week and for the first day there we stopped by this place. I ordered a carne asada torta and my boyfriend ordered the carne asada burrito. The carne asada is super good and the torta bread was soft to the bite which I've never had! The food is super good and we were not disappointed at all. Agua de horchata and Jamaica were good. Covid-19 guidelines were placed and hand sanitizer were available inside but not outside. Also a customer entered without a mask multiple times and they were not said anything. Other than that, would definitely recommend!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The tacos were tasty and the service was great! Prices are fair, so are the portions. The food was made to order quickly, everything was fresh. I enjoy their salsa as well as the tacos. Worth checking out."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"The place is clean  and the location is good
The food is overpriced for what they serve.. the vegetable alambre was dull and not enough vegetables in it just a bunch of tortillas piled on my plate 
The meal cost me $14 and  it was not very flavorful 
Used to like this place but they are overpriced now"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This place is really, really good. Every time I come to SB and eat tacos I always come here. The shrimp tacos are amazing, especially cuz they add cheese. The al pastor with pineapple slices are delicious. I love it when they put pineapple on al pastor tacos. Parking is a little tight but there's a lot of street parking. My only peeve is the tortilla they used for the taco. It was a little
Soggy so it means that they were steamed or reheated. Other than that it's amazing."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Cuernavaca has become my go-to burrito spot since moving downtown. Their burritos de pollo are amazing and have brightened many dark pandemic Fridays. Thank you Cuernavaca!!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Best tacos and value. Typically I love meat in my tacos, but the veggie tacos are amazing!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Get the same thing every week. Bean rice and cheese burrito with their habenero salsa never disappoints. Always fast and delicious.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great tacos...slightly off the path from the always popular State St.  We tried four of the street tacos...two beef, one tripe, and one pork.  They were really tasty...lot of compliments to put on them including cilantro, onion, salsa (s), and spicy carrots.  We loved the simple feel of this place...so glad we selected Curenavaca when we landed on tacos for our choice of food for the evening.  Very good prices, friendly staffing, and easy in/out.  Try this place soon!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I'm going to keep this short sweet and to the point . These were easily the best tacos I've had in Santa Barbara. This is definitely my new ""spot"" and I'm extremely happy that I decided to drop in on a whim."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is one of my favorite sops spots in the area. They offer 3 sopes for under $10 with the option to have them all different. The vegetarian one, chorizo and chicken tinga are all bomb.com! You won't be disappointed."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This spot is legit! Authentic tacos. If you like tripe and tongue, I recommend those. If not chicken and carne asada were excellent. Everything tastes fresh. The tacos are on the smaller size so I recommend more than 1. The beans were my absolute favorite."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The tripas were perfectly cooked , they really know what there doing . The gorditas are phenomenal freshly made to order with the perfect crunch"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"One of my favorite Taco and Burrito spots in Santa Barbara. 

Their Lengua and Tripa tacos are delicious. Very easy to order and your food is ready right away. Great place to visit for your work lunches. 

Overall. A top quality and authentic Mexican restaurant."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,This is the BEST Mexican food in town. We've driven by many times and decided to give it a try last week-- I'm SO glad we did! This place needs all the 5 star reviews. THIS is the Mexican place you've been looking for.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Cuernavaca is a city about 30 miles south of Mexico City.  It was founded 3200 years ago and is nicknamed ""City of Eternal Spring"".  Cuernavaca is also a wonderful Mexican Food restaurant on Carrillo Street.  

I have been there a few times.  The first time a made the mistake of ordering tacos.   Yes they were good, actually they were better than good, they were excellent!!!! But as I learned in my next visit you don't go to Cuernavaca for their tacos!!   You go there for their plates!!!   

As you look at the menu of all the different plates and all of the different choices, don't be too stressed.  One with pork, another with pork and chicken and another with carne asada and pork... It doesn't really matter because they all have a similar flavor and you can't go wrong.   It would be like choosing between Ferraris and Lamborghinis, there just isn't a bad decision. Last time I made it easy and just ordered the #1.

The plates come with a small stack of tortillas and have a generous portion of avocado sliced on top!    I think that they are all priced around $9 or $10 which is a deal!  If two people aren't too hungry sharing would most certainly be sufficient. 

Beyond the food they have a good space.  The back room is large and open and is pleasant place to enjoy the great food.    They have salsas which are as good as any and better than most.  The chips are included in the cost of the meal.

I went the other day with my son.  He didn't take my advice, ordered the tacos -- He liked mine better."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The food literally freeking amazing. Who would have ever thought that you could have such great Mexican food this far north from LA and Orange County. It's my pit stop every time I'm exploring and on a vacay home away from home in oc. 

The food here has its own twist to the original Mexican stuff but it's a good twist. The sopes and the gorditas are sooo delicious. I took my mom here and she loved it. 
A Mexican mom is hard to please because they think their food is better than anyone else's. So they're ya have it."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"I tried the torta de asada for the first time thinking  ""I should give it a try."" Well, the verdict is: never again! The bread  was soft but the biggest downside were the thick lumps of gordo (fat in English) I found in my torta. I ate it only because I was hungry  but picked out all the fat lumps. I wish they would've chosen a less fatty kind of meat to chop up and use for the torta. I don't think I'll have the ""torta de asada"" there any time soon"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,First time here and soo far they have the Best torta cubana! I really recommend it! Excellent service and kind staff!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Anywhere I go I will always get a burrito and this was one of the best burritos I've ever had. I got the Al Pastor burrito. Very simple, delicious, and affordable. Paired with green salsa and it's out of this world. Will be my go-to place for burritos in Santa Barbara!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Just stopped for my lunch break, absolutely amazing! Everything from service to the food is fantastic. Quick and pleasant first visit, I'll be coming back!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"I had the carne asada and the chicken taco on their outside patio.    The tacos were authentic Tijuana style, but the taste wasn't as good as the ones I've had in TJ.   For me, it is 3 stars... but my wife liked the place much more:  she said the veggie tacos were incredibly good.    

If I find myself back in SB, I'd definitely give it another shot..trying the veggie taco and the al pastor next time."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Authentic food, lots of vegetarian options, not expensive. Very pleased!

We had originally been hoping to check out La Super Rica, but the line was incredibly long, so we opted for Cuernavaca instead. I'm SO glad that we did. As a vegetarian, I was so excited that there were a variety of vegetarian options (unlike at LSR). The food was reasonably priced and delicious as well. Very authentic taste. definitely a hidden gem in SB for Mexican food."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Real deal taco place right off the 101 freeway on Carillo Street in Santa Barbara. Tried the Al Pastor, Shrimp, and Chorizo tacos. Also, tried the carne asada burrito. Everything was really good. Tacos are double-tortilla style topped with a pineapple wedge. Note, the shrimp tacos did not come with a pineapple wedge. The pineapple helps with the sweet and spicy element, especially after you add salsa. I believe only the pork tacos come with pineapples, but not sure. Salsa bar options are ample from green to red plus fresh cilantro, radish, and marinated carrots. My favorite was the Al Pastor. The burrito we ordered was also really flavorful. The rice in the burrito was buttery and soft while the cheese sealed the deal. Highly recommended!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"A pleasant surprise to have such good food and so reasonably priced. The family had chicken quesadillas, tacuitos, and the gringa plates. Overall, much flavor and a slight spicy kick; the available salsa bar enhanced the dish."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Passing through Santa Barbara on my way to LAX I decided to stop for lunch and try the Torta Cubana. As their website menu describes, it is a bomb of flavor! The pork is tender and thinly sliced. I also had the green hot sauce, but dip. The flavor of the Torta on its own is very intense (in a great way) so I would alternate bites with and without the sauce to enjoy two amazing flavors in one meal."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,I loved this place. Their gorditas were flavorful and their salsa was top notch. I am looking forward to coming back here many times.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"AWESOME!!!!!!
My FAVORITE go-to taco place i Santa Barbara.

ALWAYS  nice-fast service, really reasonable, and super meaty DELICIOUS tacos. 
Salsa bar is fresh and bountiful; it is especially wonderful to be able to help yourself to cilantro and limes. 
Very clean. 
The cooks are always smiling. Good energy! 
Really good wall art transports you to their area of Mexico."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,A very good place to eat the best tacos in town . Tacos al pastor with a Mexican original flavor . My favorite Alambre . If you go there really try it you are not going to be disappointed.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,One of my favorite places in California food cooked with flavor definitely stopping by when I'm on this side of town
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"So delicious that we forgot to add the salsa until we were almost done with our plates P:

I was looking for a lunch spot in Santa Barbara, and everything seemed to be too pricey (like $15 organic salads at cafes), too generic (sandwiches and salads... meh), and/or was situated in downtown with street parking only (wishful thinking).  It was therefore an easy decision when I came across Cuernavaca, with budget prices, an astoundingly diverse menu, and *score* a private parking lot.  

Before I get your hopes up too high, no it's not one of those Mexican places where you can get endless, endless plates and end up with a bill so low it defies the laws of economics.

The highlight of Cuernavaca is the wide array of menu options, including dishes that I haven't before seen before at other Mexican places.  The EL FORTACHON (~$9) sounded like a hot mess of a scramble with every ingredient you can imagine, but it was delicious.  The amount of cheese and avocado were just right, not too heavy but added a satisfying, creamy dimension.  Paired with the soft fluffy tortillas, this adventurous entree antiquates fajitas.  We also got the SOPES (~$7 for 3 I think) because it's less common than tacos.  I've tried sopes once before at a sketchy taco truck in LA, and the ones are Cuernavaca are better (and less questionable).  The crispiness was on point, and overall it went very well with the meat, lettuce, dab of sour cream, and crumbled cheese.  

A lot of people rave about the salsa bar, which I found alright with lots of salsa selections and chopped radish, but nothing too mind-blowing.  I liked it mainly because it made my pictures look good.  

Service was polite, and I liked the energetic vibe of the kitchen--we occasionally heard the staff laughing in the kitchen.  Following the good cheese comes from happy cows maxim, I can attest that good food comes from happy cooks."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Amazing lil taceria!  I made sure to fill up on the hot sauces, tasted the mild and thought maybe it was mixed up with the hot. Nope! Definitely not! The hot is hot enough to burn your ass the next day , and the mild is hotter than most hot sauces with a hint of avocado. Both absolutely delicious on my chicken tacos and shrimp."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Un restaurante nuevo en nuestras visitas a Santa Bárbara, no lo recomendó una persona que vive aquí. Y déjenme decirles que la comida muy rica sobre todo los alambres  100 por ciento recomendado. 
Gracias."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,The tacos are good but I expected them to be excellent based on the reviews. I tried the chicharron prensado gordita but it had a weird taste
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I've gone by this place and I've been wanting to try it so  my husband and I decided  to go try it out today.  We ordered the alambre, lengua tacos, and  gordita chicharones. 

My husband had the lengu taco, they were very good, moist

I had the the Alambre, it was very flavorful, very large portions 

We shared the gordita by far the best out of the three...the chicharones were perfect  and the bean, you can tell they were fresh 

only thing is the tortillas were not home made - fresh....I was expecting Fresh Tortillas since that's what they advertised on their website...but over all the food was delious....we will be back"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"I got the WORST food poisoning here! It's too bad because the owners are so nice, the selection great and the prices reasonable. However, I would get a little sick each time I ate here, then the last and final time I really got dangerously sick. Wrenching stomach cramps, clutching the porcelain altar for a good 48 hours. I mentioned this to someone else and they said their daughter got really sick from eating here as well. Be careful!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Found this place via the yelp search and am so happy we decided to go there for lunch. We had the chorizo, el pastor, chicken, and asada tacos. The asada was my favorite but they were all good. The best thing was the salsas! Soooo good! Service was friendly and there is lots of seating. I will be coming back next time I'm in the area."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"The food was great!!!  Salsa bar was good too. Stopped in for a quick bite and will definitely be back!   I had the chicken tinga sopes-so so good!!!  Can't wait to try more things on the menu!!
Although it was time for closing, the restaurant was neat and clean, and the staff was friendly.  He told us we had time to eat inside too!!   Very accommodating!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Delicious and totally authentic Mexican food. We visited Santa Barbara and found this place on Yelp. It's a small establishment. There are two rooms: one where you order food and another is just an additional dining room. The staff were calling out orders in both, English and Spanish as many patrons were Hispanic. We waited in a short line to order. The staff member was very friendly and patient with me. I wanted tacos, but got a bit confused of which ones to order. He quickly explained the option to me. My husband ordered a burrito. Our order was ready in just a few minutes. We ate in the room where people order. I feel, we should've gone in the other room, because people just kept coming in. The line of about 5 people remained there the whole time. My tacos were amazing!!! My husband loved his burrito. The portions are huge! Will most definitely go back if I have a chance."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,The staff were really nice and super friendly about our naivete. I like their food hehe
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Quick and tasty Mexican food for a good price in downtown Santa Barbara - can't really beat that! My top picks:

- The tacos al pastor are great
- The gorditas are really tasty (this aint no taco bell!)
- The cheek taco, although very strange sounding, is great. Very tender meat 
- Whatever kind of taco they have as a special! I had the veggie taco a few weeks ago      and it was perfect! Spicy and fresh - the way a taco should be! 

I'm not the most adventurous when it comes to my taco choices, but my boyfriend will try anything. He liked the eye and the cheek. He didn't give rave reviews to the steamed beef, but then again, he's a man of few words... 

Good tacos, great price, and big salsa bar. Only downside is that there is not much space to park. They do have a small parking lot, but it's located on the corner of Carrillo (very busy street) and De la Vina (a one way street heading toward the beach). Just plan to figure out which direction you're coming from and it shouldn't be too difficult."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,We were just passing through and stopped at the first sign of food to grab a bite. What a treat! Super delicious tacos. The outdoor seating is so pleasant. Lucky us.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"I really HATE to leave this place such horrible review, but customer service comes first to me. 
If you don't mind tourist-inspired high prices and rude customer service, then feel free to disregard my complaints/review. 
The food here isn't the absolute BEST, but it certainly is one of the better ones I've had in a while. 4 stars for taste. The restaurant itself is beautiful and clean. The restrooms were also very very clean. 
The man in the front was quick to take our order but was very snappy and had zero patience. I panicked because he was pressuring/rushing us so much as we ordered, that I ended up ordering just a couple tacos. The second time my brother ordered, the same treatment. He was very rude to my brother, and the restaurant was not busy at all! Only reason why I didn't go off is because I didn't want to waste my time or embarrass my brother. I probably will be back, but if this happens again on my second visit, I won't be. It's really important that business owners/workers treat customers with patience and respect. NOT rolling eyes and throwing things because of a SIMPLE request."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Amazing food! I like the gorditas with a side of rice and beans. The two green salsas are delicious and spicy enough to slow me down. Haven't tried anything else on the menu because my go to choice just keeps me happy every single time! The gentleman who works at the register is incredibly kind too!
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Legend has it as best tacos in SB!

Let me say, hell yes they do!!!

I had the El Pastor  

Typically served with pineapple. I opted without. I added fresh cilantro and salsa from the self serve salsa bar.

OMG the bomb!!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Best TACOS in town. Sorry LILLYS
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,If I could give it 10 stars I would do it. I love driving from LA just to have their al pastor tacos. So amazing and delicate. I love coming here for tacos. Please follow me on my new Instagram @ultimatefoodconnoisseur.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Super tasty and reasonably priced too. I love the asada and the el pastor. The tortas and chicken tinga gorditas are delicious too. The salsa bar has some kick too. Try the green and the smoky red one if you like the heat.. The only drawback is parking so I usually end up a block or more down.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This restaurant is quite clean and I recommend ordering on the phone just so you can avoid the line and wait for the food. My family and I ordered 12 tacos: al pastor, carne asada, chorizo,  suadero, pollo, and lengua. They were all delicious! We also got a bunch of salsa and they gave us the onions and cilantro on the side which we didn't mind at all. That way we can put as much as we wanted on our tacos. We swung by just to get a quick bite for lunch and it was a good stop. My mom even wanted to come back again. For me personally, my favorite tacos were the al pastor and chorizo. I heard that the al pastor is the one people like the most which I can agree with. If you want some quick authentic Mexican food, I recommend coming here!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Pros: Lengua Taco, Chicken Burrito
Cons: None that I can think of

You really can't beat Mexican tacos. This spot is pretty legit. I ended up trying the lengua, asada, and al pastor tacos. All of them we're pretty good. My wife got the chicken burrito which was pretty tasty too. Included rice and cheese in there as well. Usually I'm afraid the chicken is going to be dry but this one was pretty moist. If you got a craving for authentic Mexican food in the area, this price hits the spot."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Nice and relaxing atmosphere. Good vibe or locals and visitors. 

I ate a carne Asada burrito which had rice and meat. I wish it had some frijoles also. 

The street parking was free and close. 

Good place. Will return on my next trip."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great tacos here. I was looking for some good Mexican food on the way back from a holiday trip, and a bunch of other restaurants were closed. I got three tacos: carne asada, al pastor, and tripas. They were all fabulous, but I think the tripas was my favorite--it was beautifully crispy and had great flavor. 

You order at the cashier and it's self seating. Because of COVID, they don't have an open salsa bar, so you just ask them for salsa on the side.

Would definitely come back here if I'm ever in the area."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic food. I just moved into the neighborhood and don't have my kitchen up and running yet so I decided to go exploring. My girlfriend and I found this place and decided to give it a try. I'm always skeptical of trying new taquerias in sb as my go to, el sitio, has yet to be dethroned.  
This place gives el sitio a run for its money. I got an asada burrito and tried a few of the different tacos l. My girlfriend got a torta. All of it was amazing. We have since visited 3 times in two weeks. Bad for my waistline but good for the soul."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"One of the best enchiladas that I have had on the Central Coast. Their tomatillo sauce on the enchiladas is amazing. It's tangy and has quite a kick of heat! Made my eyes water a little, and I loved it. Everything had a homemade taste and look, so I'm happy to inform you that they do not use refried beans from a can. 
The staff was very friendly, and everyone seemed very organized with their tasks so customers were being helped in a timely manner. I like that they have their own little parking lot. 
Overall very enjoyable, and I will have to be back to try out other items on their menu."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I'm so glad we stumbled upon this on our way back to our hotel after a long day of shopping. This place had some delicious authentic Mexican food. I got three tacos. I got the chorizo, tongue, and beef. My favorite was the tongue. The meat was super tender and soft. Then, I loved the beef. My least favorite was the chorizo because it was slightly dry. I loved how they had a topping bar. You could add cilantro, onions, radishes, pickled carrots and different sauces on your tacos. The pickled carrots were so good and literally all the sauces were so flavorful."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"Not a fan of bad reviews. But as a new customer I was very aggrivated at how I was treated by the cashier right now. She said : how can I help you as she smacked the counter, and when I walked to the counter she immediately turned around and shouted someone else's order. When she came back to the window I asked if the NORMAL ALAMBRE came with rice and beans and she yelled: no no no no! And I responded okay I was just asking and left. Not coming back here again if the cashiers are so disrespectful. Most combinations at restaurants come with rice and beans, and it was just a simple question. 

No need to shout or be disrespectful.  We are paying customers."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Doesn't look like much when you pass, but this place is incredibly delicious. True authentic Mexican food in the heart of Santa Barbara! I love this place and will continue to comeback and bring my friends!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Amazing tacos, excellent salsa and the Pastor Burrito will make you want to slap your mama. Well, maybe not, but it is damn good! Perhaps you'll want to kiss the chef! That's better. 

The restaurant itself is very clean, conveniently located downtown and affordable. They added an addition to the back of the building with more seating and an additional tv. 

Dine in or take out, you'll be full and happy, quick!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Boy does this place make a good Gordita, and I'm not referring to Taco Bell. 

Santa Barbara is lucky to benefit from so many authentic Mexican quick-serve food joints. Each seem to put their own twist on their fare. Cuernavaca certainly should not be overlooked. 

The restaurant is oddly shaped with a fairly awkward front room complemented by a nearly-hidden back dining room. The off-street parking is nothing to write home about either - maybe 10 spots split with the neighboring bar. Lucky for me, it's walking distance to my home. 

I've been a few times and do love just how fresh the food tastes. It's made to order but served within a few minutes of ordering at the counter. The Gordita I ordered on my last visit (essentially a taco sandwich) was very tasty and I could tell the tortillas were made fresh which was an added treat. Cuernavaca also serves Tinga (a certain style of shredded chicken) which I haven't found at many other spots. A win in my book, for sure. 

Their hours are sporadic and you may find a line out the door, but trust me, it's worth the wait."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Chicharrón gordita 
are very good!!! First time coming and was satisfied. Parking was a little small but can park outside streets. Close to many little shops."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I don't come here as often as I'd like simply because of the location. This place is located on a very busy intersection, and the parking lot sucks! Very limited spots and not to mention a tight squeeze. 

If you don't know the area then I recommend parking on the street but that's only if you're lucky to find a spot. Weekends are usually the best to get parking. 

Aside from that this place is a must try if you're craving authentic Mexican food! They offer burritos, tacos, sopes, alambres, etc...

My fave has to be the chicken Tinga sopes which is shredded marinated chicken and the gorditas! The sope and gorditas are both handmade with masa. What I love about them is the thickness is made just right and not too much. I can actually finish them without being overly stuffed. 

I've also had the chicken taquitos plate which was a good deal under $10! Very yummy and satisfying. 

The carne asada burrito was good but the amount of meat was lacking yet again! Another restaurant that skimps on the main feature. 

Overall this place is legit and I look forward to trying more items on the menu."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Delicious taco stop in Santa Barbara! I was really impressed with the lengua especially. It was cooked really well, like the rest of the proteins! Tender, juicy, and flavorful. 
There's plenty of seating (there's a room in the back) and the staff are very kind and accommodating. Great for groups and plenty of street parking. Would recommend!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"MY GO TO!! living a busy Santa Bárbara lifestyle isn't easy. Thankfully there's Cuernavaca. They hit all my criteria's. Good food, good prices and quick service. My favorites are the carne asada burrito as well as the sopes and if your feeling adventurous the gorditas are gasssssssssss"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Tacos were competitive to lily's tacos, but I prefer the tongue meat here, the tongue pieces are cubed and chewier.

Tacos were $2ish each so it is pricier than lily's tacos, but the tongue taco is so worth it. I got the green enchilada plate and it was delish, the green salsa is so good paired with the chicken enchiladas. I definitely ordered too much food so I had pack it up, but I would come here again for their tacos, more economic. 

Try their watermelon juice! It's the best."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,The order taker was so rude!! and the food was not great will not come back! He needs to be nicer to his customers!! I am so upset i didn't get his name but he was on the heavier side.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"We stopped by Taqueria Cuernavaca for some quick, authentic Mexican food after a day of wine tasting in the area.  The COVID-19 set up with tables in the parking lot is actually quite nice and I preferred eating where we did more than I would have enjoyed indoors during ""normal"" times. Maybe they can keep some al fresco dining tables post-pandemic but I digress.

The food...

The tacos were solid. We tried the chicken, al pastor, lengua, and carne asada which each come on two corn tortillas.  While quite good, these did not blow me away.  The guy working at the counter said that al pastor is the one that ""most people like the most"" but he personally liked the chicken the best. I agreed with him, my favorite being the chicken, but that is personal preference. All were good, but lengua (tongue) is just not my personal jam.

The sopes were outstanding. We tried one of each - chicken, vegetarian, and chorizo. I've never had sopes before so I have nothing to compare them to, but the homemade corn shell that the meat sits on was thick, crispy yet soft, and wonderfully indulgent and delicious. I enjoyed all three equally - the mix of flavors from the meat combined with the corn shell are near perfection."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,"No parking, No chips, No cerveza, and most annoying, NO Chipotle Salsa like the flagship (and best location) restaurant in Ventura. WTH?  The main reason I keep coming back to Cuernavaca on the Avenue, Ventura is that salsa, I could drink it it's so good. The Alambres and all the food in Ventura is top notch, this place is LAME. Such a bummer, as I'm  a local."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"OMG! What a gem. This place is seriously one of my favorite Mexican spots in SB. Their gorditas are to die for, I had the chicharrón en chile verde and it was a perfect blend of flavors and textures, the soft masa inside and a crispy outside we're a definite moment of bliss. The hubs had a vegetarian one and had a similar experience. He also had the vegetarian tacos and said the mushroom one was one of the best flavored tacos he's had. My kids had the asada tacos combo and they ate it all up without complaining. We will definitely be retiring in our trips to SB."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I am not giving a 5 star just yet, not because it's not - i'm new to town, so I haven't compared other taquerias to give the full 5. this will probably change because I can't stop thinking about their al pastor burrito. 

but their salsas.: are the true star."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Huge portions, good prices.

Ordered the Cubano for lunch and won't need to eat again until tomorrow! Very generous portions for the price. Yummy meats and quick service. They a covered patio in the parking lot if you're eating on site.

Great spot to fill up if you need a quick and hearty meal."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I absolutely love this place. The Tacos Cubano alambre is probably one of my favorite dishes in Santa Barbara. And, their avocado green salsa is unmatched. The restaurant has lots of space now and they are quick on the orders. Usually, I call in an order and it is ready or nearly ready but the time I get there (from 2 blocks away). The Gringa and Veggie alambre are also household favorites."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Bottom line: good, cheap Mexican food.  Addictive al pastor.

I've had to update this review after going here more often, and up the rating to five stars.  This is largely due to my discovery of the Taco Cubano and Torta Cubana.  These are killer.  Killer, I tell you.  Several kinds of meat (al pastor, ham, milanesa) with onions (and avocado if you're into that).  Delectable.  Also as prices have risen at other places around town, the burritos here remain a good value, $6.50 at my last visit.  They are not super huge but quite filling.  The main thing to focus on here is the al pastor (along with the various alambres and tortas that include it).

The menu is limited to a pretty basic selection of tacos, some gorditas and stuff that I haven't tried, and the alambres, which are basically like getting a big heap of taco filling with the tortillas on the side for you to fill yourself.  The alambres here seem to be the more dolled-up items, with a variety of meats and vegetables cooked together in a tasty mix.

Everything I've had has been quite flavorful.  They have a little salsa bar with some good salsas, plus onion, cilantro, and other taco fixins.  Service is prompt and friendly.

Getting a meal here is easy on your wallet.  Tacos are only $1.60 each, which is a good price for the quality.  Four tacos for less than $7 makes for a good cheap dinner.  The alambres cost about $8-$9 and include enough meat for 6-7 tacos, so that's also a good deal.

I always get my stuff to go, but have observed the place expand in size since I first came here.  They took over the space behind and now have a reasonably spacious dining area.  The TV is usually showing the news in Spanish.  It's amusing if you get to see the no-nonsense guy at the counter knock down questions from unfamiliar customers with the minimal possible response, as curt as possible while still being accommodating.  (""What do the tacos have on them?""  ""The meat.  Just plain.""  ""Are they corn or flour tortillas?""  ""Corn.""  ""Do you have flour tortillas.""  ""No.""  ""Do you have any hard tacos?""  ""No."")

Overall this is a good place.  I'll certainly be back, especially since it's close to my apartment.  It's a cheap option only a couple blocks off State Street, and the food is good."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Great little taco shop Santa Barbara one of my new favorites. All tacos $1.60 all the time they also have great other items everything is fresh and homemade.
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is a finely run establishment. The quality and attention to detail isn't missed at all. 

I had a chicken burrito and the chicken was amazing, like how often does chicken taste so good? The rice and beans were so so but there's enough chicken in the burrito to carry it taste-wise. 

I'll be back for the torta! And I'll yelp it. ;)"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,negative,How anyone can give a Mexican Restaurant 5 stars when they don't serve Margaritas or Beer is beyond me? No sit down service. We got carnitas burritos that were extremely greasy and had very little meat. Not a good Mexican restaurant
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,Wow. Really good food here. Found this place on accident while searching for a non karaoke Mexican restaurant on cinco de mayo and wow.. Muy Bueno! Muy freakn Bueno! (Just wish they had chips and guac.)
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"I've finally found it: an eatery with delicious, (relatively) cheap, authentic Mexican food. This place is as good as it gets.

Cuernavaca is located in downtown Santa Barbara, two streets over from the famous State Street. From the outside and inside, the place has a humble appearance.

You know an eatery is authentic when the menu is first written in Spanish and supplemented with English.

The servers are friendly and the service is quick. As customary to most Mexican restaurants, there is a section for extra toppings and salsas, all of which are delicious.

As for the food, my god, it is unmatched. I'll be honest, I hadn't heard of alambres before coming here, but now they're right next to burritos for my favorite Mexican food. Alambres seem to be Cuernavaca's speciality, as their menu has more of them than anything else. The first time I went I got the Parallida Mixta alambre, which has an assortment of meats and vegetables, mixed with cheese and tortillas on the side. Remarkable. The second time I had the El Fortachón, which was similar, but with only steak and different sauces. Also fantastic. The prices are low for the area and the portions are gigantic.

If you're craving Mexican food and are in Santa Barbara, this is the place to go."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Great place to get tacos that will feed a group. Tacos are around $2.00 each. Choose from steak, pork, veggie and a variety of styles. The toppings are wonderful and authentic. If you like hot salsa you won't be disappointed.

We often order tacos for work parties so know that you can order ahead if you need to. They have takeout and a very nice dinning room in the back. Parking is a little tight so be prepared."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"So good! Great meat. I only had the tacos and the shrimp, pastor and asada were fantastic, salsas were perfect compliment. Salsa game strong. The carnitas was not my favorite, but that's cool enough other great choices. I am going back to try more stuff, the alambras look amazing. My new favorite tacos in Santa Barbara."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"They've got fabulous salsa, tacos al pastor and delicious sopes. I've never had a bad meal here. Burritos are great as well. Lots of Latinos eating in there, which is a great sign for any Mexican joint. We love this place. 

Parking is a little tricky, but locals are used to that everywhere."
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Potato Taquitos were awesome!  Tacos were small, but priced right.  Everything was delicious.  Only bummer was they don't have chips"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"Went for a casual dinner last night. I got one of the Alambre meals.  This is a mixure of vegis and meat on a plate with cheese and other stuff, depending on which Alambre you choose, and served with warm tortillas.  Eaten without the tortillas you have a delicious low carb meal, which is what I chose to do.  The salsa bar seems a bit lacking. There are 3 choices and not much else on the table.  I usually favor green salsas, but the medium salsa (red) was my favorite. SO GOOD!  Not too spicy, just right and a bit of a smokey flavor.  The restaurant has a bare bones look. They could really improve the appearance of their dining area. I guess it's really about the food, not the ambiance!   There is plenty of seating which is nice!"
uO39--k_hrCFgZh-Bl8m8A,Taqueria Cuernavaca,Mexican,positive,"This is the best torta I've ever had that I can remember. The torta cubana. The al pastor is perfectly marinated and flavorful, but not overwhelmingly salty or oily.  It's tender yet has those crispy edges/bits. Its covered in cheese, but not too much and is on the milder side, but you still get that stringy pull with each bite. The bread is warm/toasted/pillowy soft and has just enough structure to keep the sandwich together. The other ingredients with the ham, avocado, tomato, and beans give the sandwich that perfect balance and a little freshness to help with the fattiness. On the side they give a whole pickled jalapeno that is vinegary and is exactly what I needed on the side for the sandwich. It's the perfect torta."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Came by on recommendation of coworker.   The parking lot and access ramp need repaving (I'm in a wheelchair), but I ordered a chicken tamale for breakfast and it was moist and flavorful. Better than most I've had. Proprietor was very helpful.  Bought a couple of pastries which I will try later.  Glad to have them in an area devoid of places to eat."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Holy crap! The food here is AMAZING. Hidden gem of Goleta that should really not stay this hidden. I have gotten the Tri Tip, Breakfast Burritos, and the Chicken Chipotle Sammy here before because it is right around the corner from my work. 

Verdict:
My favorite lunch sandwich is hands down the chicken chipotle! The bread is EXTREMELY fresh and crispy, sauce mildly spicy topped with greens. Easy to eat at work & fast pickup. 

I always call ahead and my Sammy is ready in 5-7 minutes. World class service and friendly staff, thanks!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Good food at a good price. Definitely off the beaten path. Great tamales. And the almond cookies yum!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Cristino's is a hidden gem. It is a takeout only spot for breakfast and lunch right outside of Old Town Goleta. Their selection of baked goods is amazing, no doubt you could only select one! My favorite thing on their menu is the Tri Tip sandwich. The tomatoes and all of the other veggies with the meat and on their house baked bread, it's amazing! I know my fiancé loves their breakfast burritos and now has everyone at his work hooked on them too. We are big fans!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Really great little bakery and sandwich shop. Fresh, family owned, small business with great mexican pastries and breads which they also use for their sandwiches and torta's. It can take a little bit to get your food when it's busy though and parking can also be a little tough."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,I've visited a few times and have been satisfied on each visit. The last time I grabbed some tamales. The wait was a little long but they were well worth it. The bakery is truly authentic. Pan dulce on pan dulce on pan dulce.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"This hidden gem has some of the best sandwiches in town! The chicken chipotle sandwich (replace bacon with avocado) is absolutely mouth watering! Lorena is so friendly and inviting, we will definitley keep coming back! I am also so excited to try the tamales next time -- will keep you posted!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,I've come here for lunch and breakfast specials. Most of my orders are sandwiches and have prove to be very delicious every time I visit. All fresh ingredients. I especially love their chicken chipotle sandwich. I would recommend this place to anyone. It has become one of my favorite spots for on the go.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Great bakery and breakfast lunch place. Super nice owners . Ordered 1 tritip and 1 ham sandwich Great toasted roll plenty of meat and fresh veg. I'll be back here soon !
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"This tiny neighborhood pananderia serves up the best pan dulce in the Santa Barbara area. The little take-away bakery is tucked back behind Casey's garage - so turn at the Casey's sign for seriously good pastries. Nine times out of ten, you can get a parking spot right in from of the shop, and their pastry cases are always filled with a variety of fresh treats. Their walnut cookies are irresistible - a crumbly, sweet shortbread with toasted nuts. In the morning, their spongy-soft conchas and cup of coffee are hard to beat. I also love their orejas, pan cortadillo, and mantecadas. If you're looking for more savory foods, they also serve breakfast burritos, sandwiches, and tamales. 

Cristino's is a wonderful shop. The folks that work there are helpful and kind, and the quality of their pan dulce is superior to many others. Combine that with their reasonable prices, and they are the perfect place to grab a morning pastry or a satisfying take-away meal."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,negative,"Muy decepcionado cuando ordene 4 tacos, muy insípidos, la tortilla media fría y muy grande y eso hace que la porción de carne se vea muy escasa, la salsa verde que me entregaron estaba casi congelada, quiere decir que no era fresca y la verdad solo regresaría por el buen pan dulce que venden."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Fresh, tasty and generous breakfast burritos served with a heaping side of kindness! Heartily recommend."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Out of the way place, but worth the search .  Had the chicken chipotle sandwich.  Super yummy and fresh.  Great Mexican bakery selections too."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Listen to majority of the reviews- I was so excited to find an authentic Panadería near UCSB, and in SB area in general. The bakery is on the smaller side but the pan is amazing-they have the most popular pan like conchas, bolillos, etc but also do tortas & serve great coffee. Definitely stop by, made me miss home (LA) that much more :)"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Truly as good as it gets! Whenever I am in Santa Barbara, I always call ahead to make sure they have tamales, which they make special every week. The tamales de rajas and pollo verde are genuinely the best I have ever had. The masa is so moist and flavorful, and it holds together beautifully. A Cristino's tamal and one of their beautiful, delicately anise-flavored conchas (and maybe a few of their sugar-crusted but somehow not-to-sweet galletas de nuez for the road) is just about the best lunch I can imagine. 

Cristino and Lorena are also the kindest possible proprietors. They know me by name and always ask after me and my partner. I am so grateful they survived the initial COVID crash and hope they continue on for many years. I'll do my part!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"A wonderful find for great takeaway eating.  I just started getting breakfast and lunch at Cristino's on a regular basis.  Their lunch sandwiches are magnificent.  Their secret is the fresh baked bread that they use.  It makes their sandwiches light and refreshing.  You don't feel like you ate too much.  

There is only one table at Cristino's, so don't expect to have a sit down meal.  It's a tiny hole in the wall bakery with really pleasant people.  And there is usually a small crowd of people there, mostly workers stopping by to pick up a meal.  

I've been to all of the sandwich shops and delis in Goleta.  For lunchtime sandwiches, this place will hold its own with the best of them.  And the experience is quite unique.  Simple, down to earth blue collar working class.I wish Cristino's the best and look forward to more great food.

UPDATE:  Scrambled eggs are not on the menu.  You have to know to ask.  Try the scrambled eggs with bacon, ham, chicken, or chorizo, and coffee.  You won't be disappointed."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"After a long bike ride with a friend, we decided to check this place out and are both so glad we did!!!! While the wait was longer than usual, the food was steaming hot and delicious. All the workers were very kind and you can tell they really valued every customer. We ordered the chorizo burrito, two tamales, and some tacos... ALL SO GOOD!! I am definitely coming back again :)"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Great food and great prices. They use family recipes and make everything in-house, even the bread. We especially like their tamales and the in-house made red and green sauce. Their prices are beyond reasonable. Please try them they have a bakery too with yummy sweets."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich with ham and avocado. I ordered on the phone and picked it up with no wait despite a line being outside. The two women up front were very friendly and helpful. From the moment I spoke to one on the phone, I can feel their enthusiasm and it was a nice way to start the morning. Saw an earlier review where someone got sick from this sandwich, definitely not the case for me. It was rly good, crisp but not dry because of the Mayo and a lot of ham was added. They won't skimp you and it definitely is a small business so show support. Very difficult to find good breakfast in the area but this place has it. Also even there coffee is good! Not your typical burnt tasting hole in the wall coffee."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Bottom Line: A great local bakery

Sitting at my desk pondering lunch - I had no idea where to go and it feels like that I have been everywhere around here for lunch.

Looking around I stumbled across this place and frankly I never would have known that it was there!

I saw a picture of the chipotle chicken sandwich and decided that I had to give it a try.

I headed down there and saw, yes this place is very small!  They only have one table with two chairs.  It's really not a restaurant - its a bakery, a panadaria - so when you order, your food comes in a to-go container.

I ordered the sandwich and grabbed a goodie from the cases and sat down.

Now, it took a little time.  The nice lady who took my order came out a few times to tell me that it was nearly ready but when it did come out you could tell that some love went into it.

First of all, it was hot.  Nearly burn my mouth hot which was awesome.  I like the chipotle sauce with the mild chicken.  The tomatoes were nice a fat and the greens were fresh.

The goodie the I grabbed (I have no idea what its called.  I'm a gringo, after all.  I only know bolillo and telera) was delicious also.

This place is a thumbs up and you should check it out!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Best street tacos in SB. Done. First time I've had Mexican-Greek style chicken tacos with fresh lemon squeeze too. Never seen it done before. Insanely good. Also, go on weekends for the Birria (red tacos with queso fill + dip ... whoa). Seriously good food. Love the vibe that Cristino has created as well; everyone there is super nice, helpful and just good peoples it seems. I've only had 1 thing from the bakery (walnut cookie) but it was really impressive. Can't wait to keep trying more things (Chipotle Chx Sandwich, Breakfast Burrito). Wish wasn't so far from me in Carp!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,My son and I were touring colleges in Santa Barbara and wanted a yummy lunch spot.

vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,negative,I was really excited to eat my croissant sandwich and throughout eating it was okay but slightly off putting.  3 hours later my body was rejecting it from both ends. giving 2 stars bc it tasted good in the moment

vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,negative,We paid $40 dollars for 4 sandwiches that were absolutely awful. The chicken and turkey was definitely frozen and thawed out. It had no flavor and was actually like eating cardboard. Even the veggies were bad. No flavor and bland. How hard is it to use fresh ingredients and use seasonings?
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I've been eating here almost every day for the past week, trying new things each time and everything I've had was the best of that type of food: Adobada taco, chicken taco, machaco con huevos, pan dulce, croissants, club sandwich and oh my heavens...... the birria and consome! Everything is fresh, tasty, affordable and the service is amazing! I'm a big, food-happy guy and I love trying foods at different places. I no longer need to go anywhere else. This place is the BEST of EVERYTHING I love. The Three-Meat Club sandwich blew my wife and I away. We laughed with joy as we tried it. I told her, ""watch, this is going to be the best sandwich you've ever had"" before we even tried it. It was. I could keep writing, but nothing compares to this place. If you like food - go here NOW. Can't wait to get dinner here tonight!"

I had to get on the road early this morning and I ordered the avocado and egg breakfast burrito with coffee. The lovely lady behind the counter prepared my coffee to order and it was delicious. I waited in my car and she brought my burrito out to me. It was absolutely delicious and came with authentic salsa that was just like you'd find at any taqueria, but it wasn't watery-- it was thick and layered with flavor. The burrito was delicious!! Great value and great taste. I can't wait to come back!"

I got the 3 meat sandwich and a sweet bread to go. The sandwich was the size of my entire forearm and the thing completely filled the entire to go box. They toast their sandwiches which makes me extremely happy because the bread roll was warm, crispy, and chewy all at the same time. Their Mexican sweet bread was amazing too. Go here for delicious sandwiches at a great value :)"

I got the avocado and egg breakfast burrito which was very tasty, my sister got the breakfast burrito with no meat, which was also tasty (they even offered to add avocado no charge), and we got an assortment of delicious pastries and baked goods! My favorites were the almond croissant/bear claw and the one that the friendly guy helping us out described as sort of like a mini cheesecake. Nowhere really to sit, but a great place for take out and to take home some pastries!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Awesome breakfast burritos (huge and reasonably priced) and tamales (need to come back to try all the types). They also have a ton of Mexican pastries - I got a concha and it was a freshly baked little puff of heaven!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Very friendly service even if they were very busy. I had a Rosca de Reyes there today and it was delicious
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Loved it. Great food and great service. We ordered the tri-tip and the chicken chipotle sandwiches. Each was flavorful and substantial. Pan dulce was great as well. Wholesome food. If you have time to do a quick stop or take home some food, I would recommend. Gracias , Cristino!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,I am so grateful to have discovered this panadería.  It is the most authentic mexican bakery in Santa Barbara county. The bread is so fluffy and fresh. It reminds me of the bread I used to eat in Mexico as a kid. The smell of the bread alone makes me happy.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I am happy to have found this little gem. Tri-tip sandwich is just as good as SCD, without the lines and parking nightmare. Great prices also!

Friendly staff and lots of great bakery options."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Highly underrated, one of the friendliest and best bakeries in town. I love their croissants, whether it's the berry and cheese danish, their pain au chocolat, or their classic butter croissant, the buttery slightly crispy exterior gives way to a rich airy interior that is really sublime. Their lunch options, especially the chicken chipotle sandwich, are also more than satisfactory. Truly a hidden gem. Pictures to come."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Absolute best service!! The staff was so kind and helpful and my chorizo breakfast burrito was delicious!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,negative,"The food is okay not amazing.
The service is pretty bad. 
They seem to get a lot of business, but they are extremely slow and make you wait in a crowded waiting area.
If you order after reaching there they take around 20-30 mins to get your order ready.
The packaging was also horrible. All orders are take out, but the packaging is leaky and the pork pazole made a big mess by the time it got home."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Every time I come here I leave with a huge smile on my face. Not only is the food exceptional, the employees at Cristino's are always friendly and welcoming. 
My favorite item on the menu is their Chipotle Chicken Sandwich, and some pan dulce is of course a must. My favorites are their concha's and almond cookies, but everything I've tried so far has been wonderful. The level is sweetness for their pastries as absolutely dead on perfect, nothing is too sugary or overdone. If you're in the area this is for sure the place to go to!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Super small place, more for ordering things take out. They also have Mexican cola which I learned tastes better than American coke.

FOOD
- the BREAD: wanted to mention this first because I'm a huge texture person and the bread can make or break a sandwich for me. The bread was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. 
- Chicken Chipotle Sandwich: BOMB. Would definitely recommend. The only thing I would say is I wish it was a little more stuffed but then again the price is very reasonable for what you get.
- Tri-Tip Sandwich: It was ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. The tri-tip was a little dry, unfortunately.  

SERVICE 
The lady (I assume to be the owner) was so sweet. Her personality definitely made me want to come back just to support the business."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Don't be fooled by the basic exterior - this place makes a solid chorizo burrito - delicious, and very nice people"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Amazing fresh sandwich,  bread not too heavy,  good portion, would go back any day!!!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I love their huge breakfast burritos with everything in there, the fresh orange juice, and hot champurrado. The pastries are fantastic too, all sorts of goodies. Going to Cristino's warms the soul"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Just heard about Cristino's bakery. What a great little place. Tried several of there breads. Very fresh and tasty. I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich today. Wow!  Very very good. Plenty of meat micro greens melted cheese bacon. Soooooo good the bread they use is bread they make. It holds up to the ingredients in the sand which without our being super bready ( to much bread). It's a warm sandwich  definitely going to be a regular here they also have a tri tip sandwich and breakfast sandwiches. Staff is very friendly. Breads come out of the oven fresh and warm at 6:00 am
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,I got the adobado torts and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Can't wait to come back and try the birria tacos on the weekend special. Super cheap food top quality.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Got a croissant breakfast sandwich and a classic turkey. I was pretty excited to try their mexican cheesecake and some how they forgot to charge me but since i didnt get a reciept i didn't know it until i got back to the hotel and no cheesecake. Bummer. The breakfast sammie qas good but qish they put salsa in the bag to add to it. They never even asked and with covid we had to wait outside so i was never asked or offer. All in all, just OK."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Cristino's bakery is amazing! Incredibly nice staff and owner, great bakery items, and awesome sandwiches. Seriously can't recommend this place enough, please give this bakery a try."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I popped in at 7:15 tonight 
The adobada tacos were do delicious!!
Fresh savory 
I wish I had purchased more for lunch tomorrow 
I'll have to wait to get tamales on the weekend !!
The concha was still warm when I bought it 
Yumm"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I love this bakery.

Each conche is soft and tasty.  Egg and avocado burritos are top 3 in the world. Best chicken chipotle sandwich ever invented.

The tri-tip sandwich is burned into memory as one of the most complete sandwiches I have ever eaten on earth.

The staff is always wonderful and make this place special."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"While driving back from Pismo Beach to L.A. we asked SIRI for ""The Best Sandwiches in Santa Barbara"" - It took us to Cristino's - Now, it's weirdly out of the way in some industrial park... but don't be fooled. FIND IT! 

It's so small it doesn't even have a table and chairs for you to eat. 

But... the sandwiches are to DIE for. WTF do they put in the bread? Crack? It's AMAZING. 

Will stop back here any time I travel. Keep up the good work and spread the word.

P.S. their pastries are out of this world as well (we were given free samples!)"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Stopped by to grab dinner tonight after recently moving to Goleta and was absolutely blown away! We ordered some tacos, burritos, and of course, couldn't resist the homemade pastries. Everything was so fresh and delicious!! Not to mention, the lady working at the register was sooo kind and friendly! I cannot recommend Cristino's enough and I can't wait to come back and try more!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I caught word about this new Mexican bakery, and finally had the pleasure of trying it. I heard that their traditional sweet breads were really good, but what I was really surprised by was their lunch offerings. 

I got the tri-tip sandwich which was very good. Topped with fresh cherry tomatos, lettuce, peppers -- a must try! The cashier (I'm assuming owner?) was very nice, and helpful, and so was the chef.

I'm happy to add this to my list of lunch spots in Old Town Goleta."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"We are sitting here SOOO HAPPY after eating our takeout from Cristino's...

Just moved to the SB/Goleta area 2 weeks ago. I Yelp-searched breakfast burritos and found it. This was the best find ever!!! We will for sure make this a regular stop!! 

My BF got the breakfast burrito with bacon. It came with a traditional style Chile sauce and salsa verde. I've never seen him enjoy a breakfast burrito so much!! Honestly, I've rarely seen him this excited about any food. And he Loves food!

I asked for the vegetarian burrito as a bowl, without dairy (sour cream/cheese). They gave me a huge portion and it was delicious!!! Mine came with yet another ""sauce"" than was green and smooth (not chunky like a salsa) and had an amazing, mildly spicy flavor. I just dumped it all on! 

They had a large selection of pastries and breads in the front. I got a jalapeño and cream cheese balillo (?) for my BF to eat later as a snack. He Loves bread, cheese, and spicy. 

If you haven't been to Cristino's... go!
If you're trying to choose between Cristino's and another place... go here first!!

You're welcome."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,This place is an absolute gem in Goleta! Everybody at Cristino's are so friendly and sweet. You can tell the food is made with passion and love. Tastes amazing and made by great people! Been coming here at least twice a week! Highly recommended!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"This small, family run business truly makes customers feel like family. The Birria Tacos are only available on weekends, but are worth the wait throughout the week. The employees are all very sweet- they even gave us complimentary pastries after recognizing it was our 4th time there in 2 weeks. The watermelon juice is refreshing on a hot day. I also got the chocolate croissant (ask them to warm it up). Would recommend Cristino's in a heartbeat."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Great food that is made fresh to order. I have had sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches and breakfast burritos. All were very good and when you look at how it's made you know the cook is trying to impress and making each order like it was for themselves!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"We just discovered this place last week, and I have to say the little custard tarts they sell are THEE best pastry I've ever had! I could eat a dozen of them! The staff is really kind and it's a cute little place. Those custards though! I'll DEFINITELY be back."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Tried Cristino's for the first time today and I'm glad I did! I got a breakfast burrito and it was delicious. It's probably one of the better breakfast burritos I've had in SB. The salsas they have really  complemented the burrito. The staff was friendly and very helpful with their recommendations. I also had to make an adjustment on my order ten mins after ordering and they were accommodating.
On the weekends and during busy hours, I recommend calling in your order."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Amazing hole in the wall place for sandwiches! Stumbled upon it on yelp and wanted to check it out. They have an array of Mexican baked goods as well. 
I've had a chance to try their chipotle chicken, three meat club (sub balsamic dressing with chipotle aioli), and their tri tip sandwich. All good options and super tasty for the quality and price! Toasted and buttered fresh baked bread really makes it :) would recommend as local treat for sure and a solid lunch and dinner spot since they open till 8pm most days! 

The employees are all really nice as well."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I love this place, it's always fresh and so good! I would highly recommend this bakery."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,family-owned and a great place for some traditional food as well. Keep forgetting to add pictures so more to come soon but definitely worth the stop. I must advise to pre-order the food and it will be ready to avoid the long lines
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"We stopped by on a Sunday and it was relatively quiet. The team was so kind, and I ordered a raza tamale and some desserts. I thought the tamale was fully vegetarian but unfortunately it wasn't and I didn't know until I got home but my husband said it was good. The desserts especially the tres leches cake were amazingggg!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Best bakery in town that offers a piece of home... Mexico! The bread is amazing, the staff is so helpful, respectful and always in a great mood! The service is beyond high quality. I recommend everything they sell, from bread to agua frescas to the lunch menu. Oh man, you definitely have to try the Birria tacos on the weekend... DELICIOUS! This is the best place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, weekend brunch, take out... you name it! Try it for yourself... you will not be disappointed."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"The tiny little bakery located behind Casey's garage was packed with people waiting outside on a Sunday morning.  They have birria tacos on the weekend, 3 per order, served with onion, cilantro, grilled pepper, and consume for dipping.  The tacos were so overstuffed that you can make at least 3 more tacos out of the meat.  Service was friendly and prompt, and the price was low for the quality and quantity.  This is a hidden local gem."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Cristino's is a like finding a diamond in the rough. Amidst industrial warehouses and the airport lies this bakery as part of a quiet strip mall. Yet, the parking lot is always mysteriously full as workmen pull up to purchase their morning coffee, Mexican pastry/""pan"" or breakfast burrito. Stepping in here, I feel as if I have flown to a small Mexican panadería. It brings back memories of being a high school student when I was referred to as a ""Watino"" because although I'm White, I always sat and felt a sense of belonging with the Latinos. [Now the world knows why my nickname on my Yelp profile is ""Watino""]. The gal at the cash register is super friendly, smiley and always prefers to speak English with me, even though I respond in her native language of Spanish. I don't mind a bit because we both get to practice our secondary language skills with one another. Now here's why I truthfully come here:

TAMALES:
Most people are unaware, but they make and sell tamales here. Often run out, but if you're lucky, grab one of each. They carry a green salsa with chicken, red salsa with pork and rajas with cheese. You can't go wrong with any of them--especially if you like a kick of spice and just the right amount of masa. This is crucial.

MEXICAN ""PAN"":
Yep, they make some legit Mexican bread and pastries. They make all the different varieties, many similar in texture and sugar coated, but offering different fillings. The texture is just right here with a crispy outside and soft/warm inside. Never stale, like I've experienced at other bakeries. I love the ""conchas"" with both chocolate and white sugar on top! Then of course the crispy ""palmeras"" that look like palm leaves or butterflies, similar to an American elephant ear without the cinnamon.

COCA MEXICANA:
Many folks don't know but the Mexican Coca Cola in the jade glass bottle is 100 times more delicious being made with natural sugar, versus the American version with corn syrup. I also prefer the smaller amount of carbonation. They carry it in the refrigerator with juices, flan, and Jarritos.

Believe it or not, I always come here first thing in the morning to get the first pick. However, I continue to tell myself to come here for lunch because they offer various sandwiches that sound delicious according to the other Yelpers!

Now listen closely Cristino's: I want you to succeed so I exposing you to the Yelposphere, but please succumb to any changes. I like you just the way you are!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Cristino's is now part of our regular takeout rotation - their breakfast burritos are huge and have great distribution of ingredients, and I'm obsessed with their tamales. Order tamales early because they're so good, they often run out! Also, the staff is amazing and following all COVID safety protocols."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"This bakery is located behind SinoWest kung fu studio.  You can't see it from the main road and the location is very bad for most businesses, but I assume the rent must be cheap.  They make up for the lack of good location with tasty fresh Mexican style bread and pastry.  I picked up 2 pork and 2 raja tamales 2 weeks ago and was impressed with the taste and texture.  Corn meal has the tendency to be dry and dense, but the masa in those tamales were tender and full of flavors.  I know authentic tamales aren't that health, but it was a treat to indulge occasionally.  Plus it reminds me of a Chinese treat call zong zi, a similar concept to tamales, consist of seasoned fatty meat and seasoned sticky rice wrapped in palm leaves and boiled until the fragrance of the leaves marry with the tender rice and meat  :D"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Very friendly cashier. 
I always buy rosca the Reyes as a tradition, but never find one that really like it UNTIL I found Cristino's bakery, it was delicious! The fruit they use it's delicious and the bread has flavor. So yummy! now I know where to get my rosca the Reyes year after year.  
Thank you Cristinos bakery."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Wow! Completely blown away- the food was amazing! Ordered the Chorizo burrito and Chipotle Chicken sandwich. I wish we weren't from out of town but we'll definitely come back if we drive to this area again. Small operation but wishing this business the best because the staff was also super friendly and you could tell they really care. Thank you so much!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Hands down one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had. Sadly, I just moved out of SB but will definitely visit when I'm back. 10/10 and wonderful service. The woman in the front was a sweetheart:"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Thanks Yelpers, a great find in Goleta. We were passing thru on the way to LA. Looking for sandwiches and poof, 5 star. We had three Chipotle Chicken sandwiches and 2 chicken soft tacos. Fair prices, very tasty food, super fresh. 

Called in my order direct, ready on time and fast checkout."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,THE BEST BAKERY IN GOLETA!!!!! the corn muffins are amazing and if you've never had a conchas you NEED to go here. They have birria tacos on the weekends and fresh tamales daily!!! i'm a fan for life
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Amazing place! Really loved the selection and the food.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic family owned shop. They are super nice, food is good, reasonable prices. What more can you ask for. I've had just about all of their pastries and items on the menu and have been very happy. I am a bit picky with my torta bread and it's not quite what I'm looking for, but still tastes good.

I'm a usual and plan to continue being one, I'd suggest you do the same"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Great family-owned bakery. Tucked away in plain sight behind Casey's garage on Hollister. Friendly service every time you go and always helpful when you're not familiar with their offerings, they're always happy to explain what each item is."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Love the chipotle chicken sandwich and breakfast burrito. Delicious food, highly recommend."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,I won the cake give away for my birthday through a radio station and Cristinos treated me with this yummy tres leches cake  Thank you!!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"It's been four years since I moved back to Santa Barbara, and Cristino's was one of my first reviews. Cristino and his wife Lorena had just opened his bakery/restaurant and I had the privilege of being one of his first regulars.

And now congratulations to Cristino and his staff for staying committed to our community and serving up some of the most delicious Mexican foods and bakery goods. Their menu of regular items and weekly specials has been consistent even through these crazy COVID times.

I have been a regular fan of their assorted burritos, with their Burrito a la Mexicana being my favorite. They now they have been featuring their Birria with Consume and all the fixings, and fresh Tamales each day. The Tamales do sell out regularly so I recommend getting there early for them. And Sundays have been made extra special with their delicious Menudo.

Chances are you'll notice where they are by the line of people waiting to place orders. Don't be afraid, the wait is usually quick as Cristino and staff are there to keep things moving along nicely.

Their small unassuming space is tucked behind several businesses, at the stoplights at Hollister Avenue and then right or left on to Aero Camino. First driveway on your right."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Warm staff and delish food! Tamales were amazing and fresh, baked goods were so good!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Nice mom and pop style shop. The pastries are on point then they reel you back in with the authentic tamales. This place is a hidden gem in Goleta.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"We loved this place!! Hidden gem!

Very friendly and welcoming staff!

My wife loved the egg and avocado burrito add bacon and I thought the tritip sandwich was excellent!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"My boyfriend and I came here on a whim.  We were in the mood for a chipotle chicken sandwich and a breakfast burrito. While the bakery is located in an unusual plaza, the quality of the food spoke for itself. This place is the definition of 'don't judge a book by its cover.' We came here right at closing and unfortunately, they ran out of chicken. Therefore, we are ordered a breakfast croissant with bacon and a chorizo breakfast burrito. Where do I start? I have traveled throughout the world and I have to say, this place has the BEST croissant I have ever had in my life. The buttery, flaky deliciousness paired perfectly with the butcher style, thick cut bacon cooked to crispy perfection served with a fluffy eggs and ooey gooey scrumptious cheddar cheese. If my waist could handle the increase in belt notches, I'd eat here for ever meal. I know my boyfriend would say the same. The chorizo burrito was packed with chorizo... I hate when places are stingy. This mom and pop shop deserves every single star. Best believe, we will be back again soon"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Hands down best Mexican food in the area. And the people working there are super nice.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I love this place so much, I come here at least once a week. My favorite items on the regular menu are the chipotle chicken sandwich and tortas (specifically the Milanese, asada, and adobada). Their daily specials are always a hit too!  I really like the Cubano torta, carnitas quesadilla, and fresh squeezed orange juice (which is filled to the brim and does not come with ice). If you really REALLY enjoy fresh squeezed orange juice, you'd really appreciate this place. They have three salsas (rojo, verde, avocado salsas) and I love them all. They also have birria tacos on Sunday's and I really want to try that next! The workers are SUPER sweet and so nice, I feel so welcomed every time. I always leave here happier than when I came in. This is hands down my favorite eatery in SB county. They don't have outdoor or indoor seating though, so bring some wet wipes and be prepared to eat in the car!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,This is by far the most delicious bakery in the area! Not only is the food amazing but the service is always so great. I will always come back here!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Their bread is delicious and they also sell tamales and aguas. They're menudo and birria tacos are to die for!! 10000/10 recommend
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Cristino's is soooo good. So far I've had the tacos de birria, chipotle chicken sandwhcich, and street tacos, and they have all been soooo good. Great price and even better food! Also their pan dulce is just as delicious!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Best tamales in town! Order the night before to get your share of tamales. My favorites are the rajas, but my husband really liked the chicken ones with Salsa Verde."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,I came here on Sunday to try their birria tacos with consume. they were so delicious and big !! Totally worth the money and semi-wait. I also got the tri tip sandwich. It was so flavorful and not dry at all. Both the birria tacos and tri tip sandwich were stuffed up and filling. Definitely one of the best places to get food. I also got some of their mexican sweet bread which tasted fresh and soo soft. All the staff were super friendly too.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"One of Goleta's best hidden gems!

I can't believe I've driven past this awesome little bakery so many times and not stopped in once. It's visible from Hollister but tucked away on a side street. What a great little spot. 

When I arrived, there was a small line. The bakery was following Covid protocol by only allowing one person in at a time. 

The two ladies working in the front were so sweet. One of them came out and warmly greeted the line of customers. They both made me feel so welcome. My cashier was good with the upselling! I ordered a chorizo burrito and ended up adding avocado and then purchasing one of their little Mexican Cheesecakes. I was tempted to try some of their tamales and fresh-squeezed OJ - she was really selling them to me!

I snacked on the little cheesecake which was reminiscent of an eggy quiche-like confection with the slightest sweetness. So good. My burrito was absolutely incredible and I ate every bite. 

I will most definitely be back here soon. Thanks for the wonderful service and food, Cristino's!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"They are very accommodating and treat people like real folk. We have ordered here 3 times in the past week, twice for breakfast. I prefer the Machaca Burrito."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Somehow, they simultaneously have the cheapest and best breakfast burrito I've had in the SB area. The one called the Breakfast Burrito on the menu has the perfect ratio of all the listed fillings, and they are nicely distributed throughout the burrito. The ingredients are high quality and they don't skimp on the good stuff!  Plus, the tortilla is so good. Perfectly chewy and sturdy enough to hold up. You can just tell they make their food with love. 

I've had a few of the pastries, and every one has been super tasty.

In terms of coronavirus, they are taking every precaution. Only they handle the food, they have a protective shield up, require masks, limit number of people in the store, and they offer hand sanitizer."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"So good. Awesome, fresh, and generous food. I wish I had come here earlier, but now I have to move soon! Four whole years I missed this place. Really awesome food."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,I have been looking for quality Mexican food in Goleta/SB and I have found it. Please Cristino's don't go anywhere!!!!! The Birria tacos were to die for and Juanita thank you for being so kind to me and welcoming me to the neighborhood. I can't wait to come back and try other meals!!!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Everything is delicious! We've had the breakfast burritos, tamales, chicken burrito, and - our current fave- the tri tip sandwich, with excellent bread, and great flavors. Green salsa on the side is super. The red salsa is pretty fantastic too ( pretty spicy). I should add that all the covid safety stuff is good, we typically call ahead and then pick up."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Amazing pastries. Freshly baked every morning. Very polite service. While they don't have tables you can definitely take it to go and head to the beach which is 7 min drive away. The breakfast burrito is a must have.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"This place is legit! We tried out the asada torta, carnitas torta (Thursday's special), adobada tacos, and the the green chicken tamale. You can tell the bolillo is made in house, love that they added pickled jalapeños and pickled red onions, and the chili de arbol salsa is solid. 

Everyone was super friendly and even offered to write down the daily specials (photos attached). I also noticed they serve birria tacos with consume on the weekends, and pozole every Friday - will def have to check those out! 

Specials
Monday - BLTA
Tuesday - Taco Tuesday - All tacos $2
Wednesday - Bacon cheese burger with fries
Thursday - Carnitas
Friday - Pozole and Shrimp cocktail

It's a bit out of the way, but well worth the trip for the quality of food & price!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"What a hidden gem! Super kind and friendly service, so grateful we found this place on our trip south:)"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"I love the avocado burrito and tamales. So good. Went twice with my boyfriend. He said the breakfast burrito is 10/10!! A little hard to find at first, but WOW!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Happened upon this little spot by accident! And definitely plan to stop in again when in the area. Not only is the staff extremely nice and helpful but the food is literally outstanding!! We had the chicken sandwich and the torta de Jamon and we would for sure order both again!!! The bread is to die for.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Ugh! This place isn't a secret anymore! Now it's busy all the time! Frustrating....but this is a really good to grab some food and local to my work which is a huge plus.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"The staff were very friendly and helped us with all our questions that we had about the items they had left. I was very surprised that after all the food we ordered, it came out to be less than $15. I was shocked as I thought that we had ordered a lot food. We only tried the bakery items, but the meals they had to offer sounded delicious! We came right before closing and we had already had lunch so we didn't try anything else although we were interested in the tamales. Out of the items that we got, my favorites were the cheesecake, the cookies, and the danish. Considering that their menu is not that expensive, I would recommend trying as much as you can on their bakery items because you'd be surprised at how much the total comes out to. This is a great small bakery and the staff are really great!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"If you haven't, try the tri tip sandwich to begin with. 
I like this place. People are friendly."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,My goodness! Our breakfast burrito was greasy and SO filling! It was big enough to share too!
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Hidden gem of Goleta! I had never heard of this place up until last month when my mother in law brought over pastries from Cristino's Bakery. Since then I've caught myself daydreaming and craving these pastries. The almond croissants are to die for! The champurrado is also a sweet hot drink that's perfect for those early mornings. Breakfast burritos are also a hit! I've only been to this bakery a few times but I have nothing but great things to say about this place.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Delicious selection of Mexican Breads, fresh and tasty. A great way to start the day in Goleta. Good luck to Cristino and Lorena as their bakery grows."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Cristino's Bakery was a happy discovery.  We're in town for 2021 UCSB Graduation (go Gauchos!) and are stuck  at a hotel in the hinterlands next to the airport.  Lucky for us Cristino's was just down the street.  We walked out with a box full of pastries - almond danish, chocolate croissant, mini cheesecake, lemon puff pastry, cheese danish and a molasses cookie of some sort shaped like a pig.  Yes the order was glutenous and indulgent - don't judge.  One treat was better than the next and the price was a bargain.  The service was great and the woman behind the counter was really sweet.  She wanted to make sure we were aware of their lunch menu - birria tacos (weekend only), chicken chipotle sandwich and tamales (coming back for the Raja tamale!).  She's a great salesperson - we'll be back!"
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,Always fresh and delicious. Quite the random find in the area. Prices are excellent as well.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,I never thought I would have a meatless burrito that I liked but the avocado and egg was amazing!  Unless u count eggs which is basically a chickens period so I don't.  For the price I expected one of those giant burritos but still got full.  Will definitely go back soon.
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"Consistently fantastic.  The owner is always incredibly pleasant and customer oriented.  She is always positive and friendly which is a great way to start the day.  This is my go-to place for the best breakfast burrito or burrito bowl in the area (at any price point).  
Very good portion size value.   Everything always tastes fresh.  Even though it is made to order, our orders take less than 5 minutes.
The pastries are also fantastic.  My favorite are the little round cream cheese ones and also the almond croissants.  Keep up the good work. 
If driving through, they are also close off the freeway."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"This little bakery is awesome! I love their tamales. Super moist and flavorful. My son loves their chocolate croissant and mini conchas. My husband enjoys their breakfast burrito. Everything from here is not only delicious, but also very affordable."
vyyr3G874jpRYSQo2KPZow,Cristino's Bakery,Mexican,positive,"This bakery is super cute, it is small and the workers are the sweetest people ever. My sweet tooth is so large you can probably see it from miles away. I have gotten a few things from here over time, and they have all been quite delicious. I'm going to start with the baked goods, they are delicious and fresh. I got this one cheese tart/custard tart goodie that blew my mind. The custard was SO GOOD. It was perfectly sweet and caramelized at the top. The dough it was made in was flaky, however, it was dense at the bottom and it may just be me, but I LOVE THAT. I also got a few conchas, which were not that great, it was really dry and kinda hard to eat. It may have been old? I don't think I would get that again. I also have had a few breakfast sandwiches, and the croissant one is muah! Chef's kiss! The tri-tip sandwich is also a must-get because the flavors complimented the meat so well. And the meat was tender and flavorful. The bread was also the perfect balance of chewiness and density to hold up the meat, juices, sauces, and veggies. This place is easy to miss, but the food is something you should not miss!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Really Great Tacos.     Well I have been eating here about 8 years plus, so this has been a very long time coming.  We are very particular about our Mexican food.  My wife is from Acapulco and a great cook herself I am an east coast native and started to really enjoy this food about 15 years ago.  This place is very understated and a little down trodden (almost scary).  I go around lunch or early dinner so no comment about the late night crowd . I have only had about a 20% of whats on the menu, and it was all very good.they have really great pastor (a style of pork)  I like it in tacos, about 4 or more.  They have a lot of salsa options some very spicy in green and red, plus radishes and pickled Jalapeno's etc.    Again Really great authentic soft tacos."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"My favorite taco place in SB, the carne asada is the best in town, the al pastor is not as consistently good as the asada, but can be delicious on good days.

Great salsa bar with escabeche and they give you fresh chips with all meals.

I would like to try more of their menu but the tacos are soo good i keep getting those instead."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"If you don't cry from pure bliss when you bite into their chicken burritos then you are pretty much souless. This is one of my ultimate favorite pig out spots. There is one in Carpinteria and I loved going there. When I moved to SB I thought I would die from Rincon Alteno withdraws, lucky for me and through the power of prayer to the food Gods, I landed a sweet job 2 blocks  away from this Rincon Alteno location. I'm one lucky broad! Their food is phenomenal! I'm currently salivating just reminiscing the insane flavors. What they do is magic, pure magic! I'm actually gonna go get a torta in a few minutes. I haven't had those bad boys yet. But I guarantee you I will be crying again from food bliss."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,Great breakfast burritos amongst other Mexican classics!
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"holy al pastor! wow, my al pastor taco was amazing! i loved it. and they had the carrots at the salsa bar. i heart carrots. wow, and those carrots were spicy. my mouth is burning from the carrots and salsa still. i love that feeling. next time, hopefully i'll be starving so that i can get the burrito. oooor maybe the sope special with rice and beans. although one sope is too much food for me."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"one of SB's best hole-in-the-wall mexican joints.
people rave on and on about lilly's tacos, and i enjoy them, but Rincon Alteno destroys lilly's taco game along with an entire menu of other yummy stuff. 
TACOS AL PASTOR... that's all i need to say. the same choice of meat in their super burrito is also a killer.
luckily my metabolism is fast as hell, because i just moved two blocks away from this place, and it's not looking good..."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Food was good, I had a burrito and I was happy with it. The prices are a little higher then what I'm used to, for a burrito, 4 tacos and a chicken quesadilla and 3 small drinks it was $30."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"Chile Relleno burrito soooo good!
This place is a little whole in the wall. However don't be fooled! Some of the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara. Expect great food everytime but not a friendly smile from the guy taking your order."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"Cash only, this is a place where local Mexican workers usually dine at. Had their chilaquile for breakfast and was rather blend... The sauce was watery and didn't carry much flavor.. Also tried their vegetarian taco (i know...) and was borderline awful. 

BUT.
Locals DO COME HERE, so, it's definitely budget friendly and I'm semi sure their other tacos are actually decent. 

Oh, and they use microwave on some stuff."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"ghetto hole in the wall, the chips are not free, the salsa bar is nasty dirty... seems like everything in there is either sticky or greasy... try it , it might be your thing..."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Hands down-- the best, hottest, most wonderful salsa verde I've tasted in all of Santa Barbara County. 

The tacos al pastor ARE delish."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"My. Favorite burrito in town! 

Chicken is orange and full of flavor. Only. Complaint is the Santa Barbara location has the chips and salsa containers behind the counter but still a great authentic burrito."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"This Place Is Blah. For a $10 super burrito that was advertised to have guacamole and sour cream and then only had rice beans and cheese with meat was pretty disappointing. When I called to inform them that the burrito was lacking the avocado and sour cream they told me it was inside but not visible. Pretty funny because I opened it up and there was nada. This was one of my favorite spots and they have definitely gone down hill..... I would say it's definitely false advertising having the best burrito sign outside this establishment. Los agaves, el sitio, Don Paco, Rudy's, Cuernavaca,El Bajio...... pretty much any burrito in town dominates this burrito experience."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,Torta (pastor) with the dark green chile... Bomb... Best Torta in Santa Barbara... Don't forget about the orchata
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,Food was ok. Not authentic as advertised. The loaded burrito had more cheese than the small spoon size guacamole it's advertised. Cash only place. For the price and quantity not worth it. No refills even if dinning there.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,They need to change their oil. All the food tasted rancid.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Great cheap food.

Got the huevos rancheros and a carne asada super burrito.  Both were great, especially the huevos rancheros with some awesome salsa verde (hot with great flavor).  

I'll be back whenever I'm in Santa Barbara."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Made it here when visiting -- holy frijoles!  I was only white dude -- always a good sign (I racial profile myself) ... Marvy green salsa, chicken was marinated really well -- if in SB -- GO GO GO"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"I love this place.  Simple good food.  No atmosphere - but it's not necessary.  a great taco, chips and a soda - under $5"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"Very good tacos. I had suadero, asada, tripas and al pastor. The al pastor and suadero tacos were great. I would definitely go back for more tacos. The only drawback was not being able to pay w my debit card."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"The place looks super-divey from the outside. When you get inside, it looks even more divey. But the food is exceptional, and pretty cheap. 

You order your food at the counter and pay for it, then you get called up to get your food. We had tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and the beef soup. All of it was delicious and filling. The portions are pretty big. The soup, for example, is big enough for two, and has huge chunks of beef, vegetables, and a half a cob of corn. Highly recommended."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"We went there for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by a simple menu and fast service. 

The tacos are a bit more expensive than Lilly's which are $1.35, at Rincon they are $1.90.  They come similar with small soft corn tortillas, but Rincon also has chicken as a choice, they also have burritos and horchata - yum!

Lunch was about $7.00 for three tacos and one beverage."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Tacos

Pricier than Lilly's tacos, but a lot more options too.  Have been here several times and enjoyed my food each time."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,My go to place for chicken tacos (and I don't usually like chicken tacos)!  Cash only but they have an ATM.  I love it here.  I've been going for a few years and a couple of times I didn't have enough cash and they let me pay them next time.  Love that!
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"My wife and I had their breakfast burritos.  I had the chorizo as my choice of meat and my wife had bacon. The burritos were decent size and filled us up.  However, the price was a little steep.  With 2 burritos and 1 bottled water, we paid $16.00.

As for the service, it was great.  The gentleman taking our order was very nice and offered suggestions on what to eat.  The scenery surrounding this place is ok.  There is a little park right next to it but there does seem to be a lot of homeless people around.  So if that does not bother you, I would say stop by because there food is good, but bring cash too.  They don't accept credit card.  They do have an ATM inside."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,Burritos and tacos are great. Their nachos were tasty but not stacked enough. It's a grimy little shop but damn their food is dank.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"my new favorite mexican food in SB.  so pleasantly unpretentious and low-key.  the chicken burrito is insanely great with a unique flavor (and unusual curry-like color) and perfect size.  big but not too big, it stays together (mostly) when you are eating it which makes it perfect to grab and head over to Crackhead...er...i mean Vera Cruz park next door to eat under the warm Santa Barbara sun.  the chili verde is also fantastic, super flavorful and fabulously tender.  the wife gave the veggie burrito a good grade but i've yet to try it because i'm so cracked out on the chicken one.
also the salsas are great contrary to what others have said...
the green salsa is surprisingly hot..."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Very good tacos al pastor among other things.  

Someone gave them one star based on their bathrooms?  If you are going to spend $4 on lunch, please do not rate the place one star because their bathrooms are gross. The tacos are good."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"this place is excellent...

i have tried many taquerias looking for anything that comes close, but i've been sadly disappointed every time. 

oh al pastor, how i love you. wish you were closer to the bay."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"This is authentic Mexican Food, and it's as good as it gets.  This is not Americanized, so don't expect taco bell.  This is real Mexican food. The place is funky, folding chairs and plastic tables.  Expect, soccer games in Spanish or a Mexican soap opera blaring on the TVs.  Forget it if your looking for romantic.  But is you want the best Mexican style tacos, pastor, chicken, beans, etc.  This is the place. 
Remember a Mexican Taco is 2 small corn tortillas, meat, salsa, onion and cilanto.  No cheese, lettuces or tomatoes.  Those are american additions.   
Whenever I drive by I buy a dozen chicken tacos for my 2 kids.  They love them.  I always get the pastor tacos.  Free chips and good salsa bar.  I wish I drove by more often.  Oh and they have a Carp a location too.  Same great food, similar poor ambiance."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"Bleh. 

I had such high hopes for the place, but what a let down. The menu and the place were all very convincing... but

The salsas were freaking boring. 
The pico de gallo looked as if were a few days old, meh. 
Not going back."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"I can't say if the food was good or bad because I didn't eat it. The reason being, the cook was picking his teeth with his finger repeatedly and then touching the tacos I ordered. I politely asked for the food to go and proceeded to throw the tacos out in the garbage can outside(without them seeing). I'm bummed because this place has gotten some good reviews."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"I didn't try any foodstuffs other than drink & chips y salsa, but I hope to remedy that another time.  The salsa was nice and sinus-clearing.  They have at least 4 flavors of jarritos, and if I drank soda on a regular basis I'd order jarritos by the case they are that delicious.  I had the jamaica flavor (hibiscus, I think), & my friend had the mandarin which is also always a good choice."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,Very good tacos. Has about the same price as Lilys $1.90 each. They have a little better selection of meats and other foods. Will definitely be back. Definitely recommend if you have not tried this little taco shop.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"My new favorite mexican place.  It's a hole in the wall serving mostly Mexicans.  Everything is spicy and really well flavored.  Great salsa bar, plastic forks and chairs.  Great authentic Mexican food.  Inexpensive."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"I live in LA and work in Santa Barbara. I argue Santa Barbara has some of the best, authentic Mexican food in Southern California. I had my first burrito here in 2005 and I keep coming back. Even my wife from Texas, who hates Tex-Mex, really likes this place.

Yesterday, I had to grab a quick burrito, and they gave me a bunch of burritos to take to the Firefighters working the Thomas Fire. Great food and great local business owners."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"World's bombest veggie burrito.  I have driven the length of California for one of these bad boys, and I'd do it again.  Mmmm mmm.  When I lived in Santa Barbara I seriously ate here way way too much.  But oh so happy in the tummy."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Best Al Pastor Burrito EVER!

I used to go here all the time when i was at UCSB, when they had a sister restuarant in IV. If you haven't tried the super al pastor burrito, you are missing out- Rice, beans, cheese, salsa, guac and juicy-tender-greasy-al pastor-goodness.

Now that I am in the Bay Area, I've yet to find an al pastor that is comparable. Some reason the al pastor up here has too much pineapple juice(?) or something. It is just too dry and too sweet up here. 

So,  whenever I pass through SB, I have to stop by ""ghetto burrito"" and get my fix.

There is not much reason to stay for the atmosphere, the salsa bar is always fresh (take it togo), chips are homemade (take it togo), plus you'll want to wash your hands and face after you finish your ""ghetto burrito""."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"Gross, gross, gross! 

The food was pretty decent. It wasn't anything special in terms of Mexican food; I've definitely had better, but I did like that they offered many combinations of fillings in their burritos, and I could order something off of the menu, rather than having to pick and choose ingredients for a custom burrito. 

The atmosphere was a bit...creepy. At the time, my friend and I were the only white people in there. Now, that's all fine (lots of Mexicans means decent food, right?), but I could have done without them staring at us the whole time. 

The T.V. was set to a Spanish station that featured lots of bikini-clad girls dancing around to mariachi music. I'm not sure if this was a positive or a negative. I found it positive because it was like watching the Spanish version of MTV, and I like learning about other cultures. It was also positive because if people were ogling the T.V., they weren't staring at us!

So, what knocked Taqueria Rincon Alteno down to one star? THE RESTROOM. IT WAS DISGUSTING. Now, I've been down to Mexico and have dealt with the piss-poor (no pun intended) sewage systems, or even a complete lack of a sewage system. I know that you can't flush the toilet paper down the toilet. In Mexico. However, this is the US of A, and you can't tell me that the sewage system in a ritzy area off the 101 isn't able to handle toilet paper. There is NO reason why I should have to sit next to a basket full of wadded-up, used toilet paper when using the restroom in a place that serves food. That is just gross. I literally felt sick and couldn't finish my food when I came out of the restroom. Don't go to this place, not even for a quick bite to eat and restroom break on a road trip, like I did."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,THE best pastor tacos ever.  You have to eat at least three and then top it off with a Negra Modelo.  And the salsa is extra hot hot hot.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,This is my favorite place to get traditional Mexican food.  I love the location and the the food is flavorful and authentic.  The tacos and burritos are exceptionally good. The price meets my wallet and I'm never unsatisfied when I leave the restaurant.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"I absolutely love this place.
Down to earth place with friendly folks and great food.
I have not had a single thing there that I didn't enjoy/
Be sure to ask for your chips. The salsa selection at the Salsa Bar is perfect.
The little soft tacos are fabulous. Try the Al Pastor or the Asada or the Carnitas. Hell, try them all! They're all great. 
Quesadillas are a perfect option to the tacos. Or maybe a combo plate. I'm getting hungry just thinking about the place.
Step up to the counter and order your food. Then sit down and they will bring it to you.
And very reasonably priced. I don't think it gets any better than this."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Perhaps the best tacos in the world 


very friendly staff, four different kinds of salsa, and some of the best Mexican food you'll ever have. what more"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"It's not a fancy Santa Barbara sit down experience. Order at the counter, then sit down and they bring the food to your table. Then please clean up after yourself or they will bus the table. The food is outstanding and the salsa bar has all the options you will want. My go-to is a plate of 4 Al Pastor Tacos. They come on two corn tortillas for extra support to the tacos. And get a glass of Horchata or Jamaica (Pronounced ha-Mic-ah) and enjoy one of the secret spots for honest Mexican food in Santa Barbara."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,Yummy crunchy tacos.. don't go for the environment . Its hard to find good crunchy tacos. Chips were old and stale and they forgot some sides i asked for  so i had to go back .But  the good  crunchy taco outweighs the service  .
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"One of the most authentic Mexican burritos I've ever had - tortilla and meat was grilled to perfection, and it was a long overdue explosion of flavor that I had missed being away from souther California, so thank you!

My only gripe that prevented this from getting 5 stars was their guacamole.  A) we paid extra for guac in the burritos; and couldn't find it until the last few bites.  B) when we did find it, it was more like an avocado salsa than a true guacamole so it was a bit cheap.  If you're gonna charge extra for guac, give me guac.  

Other than that - it was fantastic."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,The are very rude and serve much lower quality food to white people.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,Staff is not particularly friendly and the restaurant won't win a price for their decorations any time soon....but this is the best Mexican food I've had my whole life!
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"WOW, Is all I'm going to say. Absolutely delicious in every way shape or form including cost! I got the breakfast burrito and the crispy tacos with rice and beans. All of it, was delicious. The burrito was not dry and gross it had such great flavor and was juicy which is how I love them. 

The tacos for my wife, those were to die for, absolutely delicious and the price for everything was extremely Reasonable compared to the 12 other places we've tried who have all been gross, overly priced for the quantity you received or just plain rude cause we're not Mexican. 

HIGHLY recommend!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,Crispy tacos were crispy on one side. All 4 of them. The burrito was COLD as I got it. Had to ask to reheated in which they ruined the it by just pan frying it on 2 sides. Overall one of the worst Mexican dining experiences I've ever had in this town and Im a local born and raised
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"Not really good food or service. I am Mexican American I have been eating Mexican food all my life. I don't usually believe reviews I am often disappointed by high reviews here. but I have to say... here they portion out a  tiny container for the salsa bar. they charge for chips. the burritos they serve are greasy and tough cheap meat cuts. I have found them rude many times and these days I am on the run and don't eat a lot of beef. so I came in and asked for a vegetarian burrito. I often ask if they could melt the cheese. they said they don't do burritos that way. I said you just have to put the cheese on first . the cashier told me that would be an extra two dollars charge so I asked for money back and didn't  look back. folks Santa Barbara is loaded with good Mexican food,. there are plenty of alternatives to Rincon!!!!!!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,Awesome food! Reasonable prices and good portion sizes. I recommend the breakfast burrito and horchata! My friend loved the crispy tacos.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,Bomb meal! Down home service. Very reasonably priced. A+
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Really good Mexican place with very friendly staff. Their meat is delicious and well prepared. Their crispy tacos were very good as well, even though a little bit on the greasy side that's why I prefer their soft tacos. But very nice little taqueria!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"One of the best taqueria's in town and one of the most reasonably priced. It's not often that you pause at how good the rice and beans are -- right after doing the same with a carne asada taco. As a teacher at Antioch, it's my favorite quick bite before class!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,The chicken soft tacos and the crispy chicken taco were soooo good! I'm definitely coming back. The only problem is that they close at 3pm every day.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Best crispy chicken tacos ever. Perfect tiny spot to grab a quick bite. Now that I've discovered this spot, I expect to be coming back every week. Cash only!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"The crispy tacos are some of the best.  No hype and lines like other places on Milpas.
And their burritos are not $12 bucks
Solid all the way around"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Breakfast burrito with carne asada was great. Not the best asada, but good, fast service and the salsas were amazing!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"I found this place thanks to the great reviews on Yelp. The food is tasty, the service is friendly and the price is right."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"It's been over a week and I still can stop thinking about these tacos. I got three crispy tacos; al pastor, pollo and chorizo. All were fantastic. Next time I'm back in Santa Barbara this will be my first stop."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"I knew I was going to love this place the minute I walked in the door. Delicious and extremely authentic Mexican food. Very reasonable prices, good portions, awesome spicy salsa. Be sure to check it out for a casual Mexican food stop!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Swung by this lil taqueria for lunch today. Always great to find awesome taco shops in town and this one definitely is worth checking out. Let it be known, that this taqueria is CASH only.
Small little shop off Haley, blink and you could pass it up. They have a small parking lot behind the shop, just before the park. 
The soft shell tacos were a bit on the smaller side, but, dont let that size fool you, they are super juicy and tasty tacos!  The chile verde taco was really good, scarfed that one down with their ""hot"" green salsa (its got a lil kick, not bad)
The crispy tacos were the highlight of this lunch visit. Crispy shell topped with some cheese, and much bigger than the soft shell tacos. IMHO the crispy tacos cost 1.40 more than the soft shell, but you get almost double the taco, in a crispy tasty shell.  Next time I come back I'm going all crispy tacos. Stoked to find another solid taco joint for the books!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"The crispy tacos here simply amazing! They are really some of the best tacos in Santa Barbara! Prices are fair, service is friendly and extremely fast. The place is very clean and well run, be sure to grab a few of each of their salsas, they are all delicious! Highly recommended!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"Over all a good place. I ordered the super el pastor burrito (which includes guacamole in it.) it was a good size, included chips and salsa for $9.75 The el pastor was not the most flavorful I've ever had but I'd give it a 8/10"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,"A must try: crispy tacos either pastor or carne Asada, or hey do both! You will want more! (My absolute favorite!)
Also recommend the chorizo breakfast burrito, just the perfect size for a quick bite to eat in the a.m. 
Love this place!"
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,positive,best tacos ever. quick and easy service. great atmosphere. crispy asada and tripa is to die for.
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"Aight. There's a decent salsa bar at this place, and the food is also decent. It is a divey place, so don't expect too much out of it. Al Pastor is very good here, but some of the foods are pretty watery and rather expensive for what you get. Some of the stuff tastes microwaved like the Torta which I would try something else, and note that it's a cash only place.

Their nachos are probably their most filling menu item. Go elsewhere for anything else, or if you're feeling hygienic."
ygZyTUWS4dbVL8d6vAiN4A,Taqueria Rincon Alteno,Mexican,negative,"If i could give zeros i totally would my sister asked for tacos with only meat and the guy got the order wrong when we went to tell him he took the order wrong he said if he made it again he would have to charge us again, when HE DIDNT LISTEN ! I have never been to a restaurant that Charges you for making your order over after they messed it up !"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"I love El Sitio...in Isla Vista. I ordered a burrito with avocado, was charged extra for the avocado, and drove to work to eat a burrito with no avocado in it. The horchata was watery and not worth it. Try the El Sitio in Isla Vista: they are much more on top of it and the quality is better."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Super disappointed in this place! Their service was nice but their breakfast burrito is almost $9 even though its advertised as $6.99 (i didnt get any additions). 
I would have been ok with it except the burrito was so puny when it arrived! Almost the same size as the little burritos youd get at a cafeteria on a school campus. 
By comparison, super cucas and daily grind are both substantialy larger burritos with better flavor. 

From a flavor standpoint it was also subpar, and i ordered a chorizo burrito and they put in some other kind of random pork cut. 

Get it together el sitio. Mexican food isn't difficult  and it shouldn't be expensive."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Clearly we're not here for the atmosphere yet it's still the best Mexican food anywhere. Although I no longer live in the area, I still stop by when driving thru town, even if I save a few chicken burritos for the coming days"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"The category:
Cheap eats

The seven-word skinny:
Made to order Mexican on the cheap

The review:
I've been a patron of El Sitio for over 10 years.  Though I can't there as often as I'd like, I make it a point to stop in an get my favorite dish - the Brocheta de Bistec - everytime I'm back in Santa Barbara.  Unlike most Mexican restaurants, just about everything item on the menu is made-to-order.  That means freshness and taste that's unrivaled by your typical burrito joint.  This place isn't dirt-cheap, but it's only a few quarters off.

They're most famous for their tortas (Mexican sandwiches) but I've never ordered an item I didn't enjoy.  They also have horchata which is crucial when eating spicy comida mexicana.  A great place to grab lunch, especially if you're heading across the street to play some par 3 at Twin Lakes.

The good:
Have it your way, but without the microwaves, excellent pico de gallo.

The bad:
Very basic and functional layout - we're talking plastic chairs, people.

The notable:
Easy access off the 101 and across the street from Twin Lakes golf course, long lines for tortas during lunch peak.

The Junius pick:
Brocheta de Bistec (pork w/ mushrooms, green peppers and cheese melted over three corn tortillas).

The person you're dating:
Can be brought here if they're a native Santa Barbaran or UCSB student.

The significant other/spouse:
Should be brought here as an indoctrination to Santa Barbara food culture - unrivaled quality and flavor in the laid-back SoCal setting.

The last time I was there:
Feburary 25, 2006.

The number of times I've been there:
more than 50."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"What a disaster. Came here with my girlfriend last night for a to go order, because she had been to the other El Sitio (but thought it was this one) and liked it. She got a chorizo torta, and I got a pork burrito (I forget the name, started with an ""a"") with two tacos. Now here's what I want to emphasize:

The burrito and tacos came with NO toppings. When we got home and opened our food, the burrito was literally filled with rice and meat. No beans, no cheese, no onions, no tomatoes, no anything. Likewise, the tacos were simply dry cubes of meat on tortillas.

I have been to many Mexican restaurants, and I've never been given simply carbs and meat in a burrito or taco. They didn't give any sort of notion while we were ordering and paying that we were supposed to order toppings extra and that they weren't automatically included in the food. As we were waiting for our food, I saw multiple customers come and pick up their food and their tacos were loaded with onions and cilantro and the like, so nothing seemed out of place. There was no topping side bar either (like they have at Lilly's Tacos - an excellent place) to give us such a notion. There was just a very unhygienic looking salsa station.

As for food quality, the torta had way too much mayonnaise on it, and the all the meat was dry and sometimes over charred. It tasted like days old food.

They also did not include chips with our order so we bought some. Normally, I wouldn't mind as restaurants are not obligated to, but, in retrospect, after buying almost $30 of their terrible food, it was the cherry on the top of our bad experience.

I will definitely not come here again, and I do NOT recommend this place. But if you do indeed decide to give this place a try, at least make sure to ask for toppings."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"I've been going to El Sitio for 25 years! Even before I lived in Santa Barbara I would make it my first stop when I visited. Now, I've moved to Colorado and finding a good burrito, or any good Mexican food has proved to be impossible for me. 
Fortunately, I recently went back to SB  and yes, my first stop was El Sitio! Rajas Burrito! It had never tasted better. Grilled Rajas, onions, their amazing housemade beans and rice. It's the real deal. I've tried other items on the menu but always go back to the Rajas, it's just my fave. There are 4 locations to choose from in the area, I've tried them all and they're pretty consistent. I will continue longing for the beach and the perfect climate of Santa Barbara but mostly, I long for El Sitio."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"I didn't get this place my first few visits because most of what I had didn't quite satisfy, but then I discovered the adobado, which is really flavorful and tender.  I never waver from the adobado and either go for the adobado mixto (adobado, peppers, onions, cheese and served with hot tortillas), the burrito  or the torta.  I normally opt for no mayo on all my sandwiches but the torta here is much better with mayo.  The food is really filling and I don't finish my meal if I want to get anything done that day.

This location, unlike the one in IV, has self-serve roasted peppers that are oily, salty, and a little charred next to the salsa bar... sometimes jalapeño and sometimes serrano...so watch out!  If they run out, request some from the cashier and you'll get some piping hot ones wrapped in foil. 

I'm into this place."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,Fresh made to order and can be modified.  Tasty and very fresh. VERY reasonable prices and ample parking.  My personal quick bit when I am looking for flavorful Alhambras!!!!!!!
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"This is a great place for authentic Mexican food.. Don't let the no frills building our interior fool you. What comes out of this place is simple cheap and tasty.

The burritos are massive and the tray of seared jalapeños is a wonderful thing while waiting on the food"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Love this place, very authentic. Inexpensive. Best Chile Verde burrito in SB"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"El Sitio translates into ""the spot""...and the spot it is. 

I had some chorizo tacos with cheese. Awesome. All for less than $6.

The horchata was very generously sized. Seems like a great iocals spot that latinos actually eat at which is always a good sign for a Mexican place."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,My husband and I discovered El Sitio about a year ago when I came here for my job interview.  We were blown away then and every time we have had it since we are equally as impressed.  The burrito's are HUGE!!  My husband and I share one and can barely finish our portions.  We found out that there are several El Sitio locations throughout Santa Barbara and have tried two others.  All of which have been just as good as the one on Fairview.  This is by far my favorite place for Burrito's in Santa Barbara!!
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"I'd give this place no star if I could. First the food - stale rice, meat was dry and seemed old, and that's it. No veggies, no cheese, no sour cream, no guac, nothing. I don't expect much but for a $10 burrito this is ridiculous. Now the service, when ordering I told the lady twice I wanted it for here, not to go. Then I asked her if chips came with the burrito. She told me chips were $3 extra. Then my friend, and the two people after him ordered. Everyone but me got a plate with chips along with their burrito and I got my burrito in a to go bag with no chips (even tho I specifically said for here twice). My friend said he was not charged extra for the chips. So the lady behind the register was blatantly trying to rip me off. Never coming here again and will tell friends and colleagues to steer away."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Love the choriqueso and raja tacos! Carne asada burrito is my fave with cheese. The burrito is so big i always have left overs for the next day.

They have a very tiny salsa bar with spicy tomatillo, mild red sauce, pico de gallo, and roasted jalapeños. 

This is definitely a mom and pop type business and one of those hole in the wall places you must try if you want authentic Mexican food. 

Prices are very reasonable! Check it out if you're in the neighborhood."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Worst place ever. If I could give then zero stars I would. I order a carnitas torta and all I got was bread with onions. Yeah thats wright no meat and did they care? No. El sitio is a good restaurant in other location,  this one is NOT.  DO NOT GO THERE"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"The people who work here are such nice people and have been very accommodating to my special requests like ordering from the lunch menu during breakfast time.  Yes, I know.  I'm a breakfast defector.  I've actually only tried the #21 from here because I like it so much it's hard for me to try another dish."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"I will never go here again. EVER. Over priced, small portions and horrible service. When I pay $8 for a burrito I would expect something a little bit larger than a taquito. Next time I will take my cravings for Mexican food somewhere else. 
Good food, but definitely not worth the large price or lack of service."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Mexican food pretty, good food. The service is pretty good  I liked I will be back to another breakfast"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Brocheta and tacos are the bomb and I have not tried the Torta yet but I am sure it is very good too. Very simple little place, not a very complicated menu so you don't have to stand there for an hour and think about what you want to order, great little place when you're on the run!!"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"It's a hole-in-the-wall taco joint. Don't expect fancy atmosphere or an extensive menu. Expect delicious tacos.

All of their vegetarian tacos (I think they have three kinds?) are fantastic. The vegetables taste GRILLED, which isn't a flavor vegetarians get to taste too often. Really satisfying."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Quick small bite...got 1 carne Asada taco and it was great!!! Plenty of meat to make 2 tacos since it comes with 2 tortillas with green salsa. Beware of their grilled jalapenos because they're HOT. Overall good choice for not getting a bigger meal. I would have rated 5 stars but the customer service wasn't great, not cheerful or inviting."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"For around $3 you get a large taco filled with LOTS of meat. And I mean LOTS. Enough meat to make two meat filled palm sized tacos.

As for the flavor, it was nothing special. The meat was a bit dry and salty - I got adobado and bistec. The taste wasn't superb, but it wasn't horrible either. There is a small salsa bar with pico de gallo, salsa Roja, and salsa verde. 

This place seemed like a local go-to joint for most of the customers inside, they had some sort of relationships with the workers."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"No points for atmosphere, only 3 for tacos.

4 taco adobado- the best choice here for moist and delicious meat dripping with a little spice
5 chorizo- dry and charred. I'll pass
7 bistek- not as good as I hoped

Sure it's a quick in and out but so are most taquerias. The stark, almost institutional interior was about as lame as the chorizo. I'll pass and hit up another one of a dozen joints in the hood."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Just went here for the first time and got a delicious breakfast burrito! The staff was very friendly and my food was so fresh. I cannot wait to come back, so glad I tried it!"

Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Got an Asada burrito, carnitas burrito and an adobada taco. The place to go for good mexican.. yes. Just don't expect too much of the sit down area or service. Its just that... a hole in the wall. Def recommend it."

Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"I really like this place for casual dining and great Mexican food. The food is cheap, but freshly made and very tasty (but spicy so use salsa with caution!) It isn't super decorated or snazzy but I don't look for that when I want some juicy tacos close to home."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,This was great authentic Mexican restaurant the food was fairly priced and had a lot of flavor. On the down side their salsa was bit watered down.
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,A go to lunch place for many years ! Gotta try the Burrito Chile Relleno ! Muy Excelente !
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Great location, but it's a little bit smaller than some of the other El Sitios and the parking can be very annoying here (small, awkward parking lot that's hard to get in and out of).  The lines here are also longer, so I've found that it's harder to get a table.  With other locations nearby, it may be easier to go to those (e.g. Calle Real and IV).  The food is the same old great stuff, and they have buche here!"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Good family restaurant,  different type of Mexican food pretty solid, good food. The service is pretty good but at the end of the day it is still a mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall Mexican spot"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Upon recommendation and good reviews in Yelp, I got an asada burrito that I was craving for. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. There wasn't much meat and what was there was mostly grizzle that I couldn't chew so maybe a quarter of the meat in it was inedible. Even so, it was a bit bland and I had to pour a ton of salsa for eat bite. I'd suggest to go elsewhere."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,This is a great local spot.  I enjoyed two tacos de carnitas and only thing that made it better was adding cheese and onions.
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"This place is expensive and the food sucks. Don't order chorizo anything because you'll get hotlinks... not normal""Mexican"" food."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Chilled spot, food is good and consistent.  Price is average and their salsa bar is okay.  The burritos are decent size...their best deal right now is 3 tacos for $5."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"i've been to this location twice before today and i thought it was ok. i've been to the el sitio location on calle real twice (and ordered what ordered today) and i didn't like it much (too greasy). 

today, this location hit the spot! i can't recall the name of what i got, but i know it was the #8 cheese melted over beef, mushrooms, & green peppers with three corn tortillas on the side. 

i was craving mexican food and this place had me chowing down as soon as i got my plate. the portions are pretty big. i got hooked up with an extra corn tortilla, but there was so much meat that i ended up having to buy another one! 5 corn tortillas, a whole plate of #8, a fanta orange soda, and two cups of their green salsa later i had a huge smile on my face and was feeling content. 

my friend who has been here in the past and thought it was only ok was blown away today too! he got the brocheta de bistec, but had it wrapped in a burrito. he said it was amazingly delicious and gave the meal 5 stars!!

prices are pretty good for what you get. only 4 stars instead of 5 because this is the first time this place has blown me (and my friend) away. i'll have to try my dish again next time and see if this el sitio deserves it's 5th star for consistency."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Don't waste your time in the Fairview location, horrible.  Will try other locations but the one in old town is a huge disappointment."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"What to say about this place?  I used to work down the street to this place and I love their tortas. Carne asada, Pork , Chicken it's all good.  The restaurant is simple, usually pretty clean. It's good, cheap, authentic mexican food, not much else to say.

nom nom nom."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Unfortunately for this place, I don't eat meat.  Their meat dishes (from a distance at least) all looked pretty good.  I got the veggie burrito and it fuckin sucked.  Beans, rice, and squash wrapped up in a slightly grilled tortilla.

I hoped the salsa bar would be their redeeming factor, but I was let down by that as well.  Not that it was awful or anything, there was just nothing impressive about it.  The salsa didn't have much of a chance at improving the burrito anyways.  

I would've gladly given them 3 stars because their soda fountain started out pouring the most delicious taqueria coke I've tasted in as long as I can remember.  I've mentioned in other reviews that taqueria coke has a certain flavor to it you can't get anywhere else.  I don't know if they overdo the syrup or what the reasoning behind it is - but the coke here was seriously the bomb...  that is, until they ran out!!  I had about half a cup while waiting for my food, went back to top off and they were all out of syrup!  Only carbonated water.  Bummer!  Meal officially ruined!!"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Really enjoy their tacos with a cold beer, particularly the rajas con queso. When they have UFC on their flatscreen, my boyfriend and I are pretty darn happy. El Sitio is neither gourmet nor classy, but I like its combination of super casual atmosphere, routinely tasty tacos, and pretty cheap offerings compared to the other restaurants in the area, which are also typically inexpensive.

The only downside is that sometimes they close earlier than their sign says. Then I'm sad because I have to go around the corner to a slightly pricier place that doesn't show UFC."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Small joint perfect for a quick lunch, the torta Cubana was decent though at 11 bucks a little pricey."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,YUMMY! Came for the burritos which were recommended to us. They are big and tasty. My husband could only eat 2/3 and I ate 1/2 and we are very healthy eaters! Chili Verde and Carne Asada were both really good.
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Not too bad of a place for quick Mexican food. Staff has always been friendly. Generally pretty good bilingually,  but alot smoother and easier if you happen to know Spanish. Only reason 3 stars is there food is so-so. Get a good amount of food for the prices but quality isn't on par with some other similar places. Tacos/burritos can be very bland, meat wayyy overcooked, etc. Quesadillas just tons of cheese and sauce. But I don't want to say that it isn't good,  it's just not 5 star worthy. Reccomend if looking for Mexican close and fast"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Pretty disappointed on today's visit. 
First things first. This location has never really given me any problems until today.
It started off with me giving multiple calls to try and place my order over the phone, with no answer each time. I decided to finally walk over just to order it in person since El Sitio isn't too far from where I stay. I got there and to my surprise there was just one other customer in the building, I was pretty upset that they did not answer but it was okay because I just wanted food after a long day. I ordered a burrito to go. I went to the salsa and condiments bar, there was like zero green chiles in the bin. They had a few lemons cut up, but overall I was very very very disappointed with the salsa. I've never had this problem before but it's obvious to me that they're now ""Watering"" down the salsa! By that I mean that the salsa is literally like water. It has zero consistency or texture and it has NEVER been like that in the past times I've gone. I got my order and took it home. I'm giving he 3 stars for the burrito that was very delicious which was just beans, rice and beef. The Pico de gallo with lime really brings out a delicious taste in the burrito and I highly recommend it! 
As far as this location goes. I'm really disappointed in the salsa bar and some of the service. The other locations around town are good ! Definitely check them out."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Their guacamole is the best food I have ever had in my life.  Ridiculously good. I always order the same thing for my meal, I think it's the #8 with chicken and vegetables sauteed with cheese and a side of tortillas.  it's good. But their guac and pico de gallo are AMAZING."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"10.00 burrito for beans rice and meat, 1.50 extra for cheese... meat not trimmed for fat so you get big chunks of that. Not horrible but better choices for a 11-12 dollar burrito there's better ones out there in town."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"We stopped in for breakfast burritos one morning after a long day of winery hopping. This was the best hangover cure for all of us! I'm not usually one to choose a corn tortilla/breakfast burrito as my first choice, but holy moley, I'm so happy we did. Pico was unbelievably fresh, the salsa verde was perfect, service was quick....can't wait to visit SB again and wolf down another one of these."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Usually taco shops with patio furniture indoors are pretty special so I got pretty excited about this place when I walked in. But then I got my taco de lomo which totally bastardized lomo by featuring over-oiled, over-cooked chipped pork, and not a particularly savory variety either. The taco de chile suizo was better, with a bunch of poblano strips and approximately 16 pounds of cheese, though the tortillas weren't particularly fresh or soft so I ended up leaving a few extras behind rather than gnaw on filler.

As you may have gathered, I wasn't terribly impressed."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,Delicious food. Tortas and burritos are huge. Adobada is tasty and filled with flavor.
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Hot, fast. very spicy! Nice local find right off the highway. Busy place. Downside is that they only serve burritos until 11am...unless ypu're special I guess. Turned us down on the burritos, but a guy that came in while we were eating was as able to get one. Carnitas were dry & chicken seemed unseasoned. Not someplace I'd go to again."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"I ate here today and I was 3/4 finished with my shrimp burrito. As I rolled down the foil paper to take another bite, what do I see? A very small fly looking insect stuck on my tortilla! It was dead and it was the size of a fruit fly, It was disgusting! I'm guessing the fly flew on top of my burrito as it was being wrapped. I will never return! which is such a shame because the staff was really friendly and there aren't many Mexican food options in Goleta."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,My first time visit this late afternoon. I found the Staff friendly and the place lovely.. and the Owner ever so Super Nice and Kind.. :).. even though I had gotten her restaurant mixed up with another restaurant that was offering the 2 for 1 Axxess offer.. She still accommodated me with my order.. My heart was blessed by her generous actions. Just Thanking her for being so very understanding! Praying that God continues blessing her & all real good!! The beef & chicken burrito's were delicious..!!Yum.. :).. I will let others know how yummy.. :).. xo Brenda W.
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Decent hole in the wall Mexican joint tucked away from all the commotion of Hollister. Ordered a chili verde burrito which was tasty but seemed to lack spice and chili; the pork was pretty tender and tasty. Pretty big burrito for the money so I was happy with it. Interior is pretty grungy though, makes it a little unpleasant to eat. In general, it's worth a try especially if you like burritos."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"I have been going here for years, and only a time or two have I been mildly disappointed in the Asada Torta (steak torta). Consistency may be the hobgoblin of little minds, but in a restaurant, it is the harbinger of success, and El Sitio on Fairview puts out a fantastic, near-perfectly consistent delicious torta sandwich. 

I have gotten their tacos, burritos, nachos, and other items occasionally, but these items are just okay (hence four stars, not five). However, the torta is the best one I've tried anywhere, and every time I try a torta at a different restaurant, the comparison to tortas from El Sitio always makes me appreciate this little hole in the wall.

And this location, near the McDonalds on Fairview, is my destination El Sitio for Goleta. I have been disappointed in the one on Calle Real (in El Encanto heights, near DP high school and behind 7-eleven). The time I went there to get my usual asada torta, they omitted the cheese, and when I asked what happened, the churlish and unfriendly staff unapologetically told me that they were out of cheese. Well, had I known that when I ordered, I might have been less ticked off about it, but just the way they said it with disdain and dismissal showed that they really didn't care. And IV? It's in IV.

Back to Fairview El Sitio: this place does not offer much in terms of ambience, although they recently introduced colorful wooden chairs to replace the plastic patio-furniture look. It's an improvement. The tables are still the plastic patio tables, but they've now gone to the effort of covering them with tablecloths and vinyl, so these are also improved. The service, which consists of the women behind the cash register taking orders, and the various cooks, are rather indifferent and not given to overly friendly interactions, but they are not grumpy. And the one time I ordered nachos, they had the courtesy to warn me of the price since it wasn't posted (I think it was $12 or so?). Speaking of price, the tortas and burritos are very reasonably priced and filling.

Old town Goleta has lots of mexican places with more popping up all the time. But El Sitio is the place for tortas."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,Good basic Mexican option with some quirks.  They are very fast at filling orders in general and have good burritos and tacos.  The salsa is good too and varies a lot in heat.  If you order something off menu or slightly different the price changes depending on the day and the person.
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely love El Sitio! When I want an authentic Mexican meal, I don't need servers or nice tables or anything but good flavored meat, a delicious tortilla and an arrangement of tasty sauces. I don't come here for the atmosphere or any other, but service is fast and efficient, food is great and I'm always happy with what I receive.

One of the reasons I absolutely love El sitio and crave it often is because they grill or ""toast"" their burritos. Another reason is because they don't put pineapples in their adobado (which is tradition I know.. but I don't like mixing savory and sweet, FIGHT ME). A classic asada buritto is also delicious. Grilling the tortilla gives it a nice crunchy feel along with the soft  and chewy goodness on the inside. Not many places do this and they do it well. 

There are a few locations, so if you're ever in the mood for some craving filler... this is it!

- Jess H."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,This is one great restaurant. Very tasty authentic food. The people that work there are very friendly. Does get crowded so pick your time wisely or you will waste your whole lunch time getting you food instead of eating it.. love this place.
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Probably the best Mexican food in town. The staff is always so friendly, and the burritos hit the spot. I don't know what else to say, authentic, filling, delicious. Just good stuff."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"I wasn't feeling the magic here. Nor had I felt the magic in coming here several times over several years.

I ordered two tacos from the cheapish menu, my friend got two tacos from the cheapish menu, and he also got a hortchata. $14. That's not very hole-in-the-wall cheapish, and this is definitely not a linen service kind of place. Think taco stand with plastic tables that just happen to have a permanent roof overhead.

The cheapish menu offers simple beef, pork, or vegetable tacos, and are in the $2.80 range. Pay $5-7, and you get a more interesting meat concoction and *three* tortillas. 
The lunch combo, which I did not get, is about $9. 

The burrito options might be the better way to go, they are around $6 with a wide selection of meat fillings.

We felt underwhelmed. The salsa selection was slim pickings, although they did have whole roasted small chiles and I hadn't seen that at other taquerieas in Old Town. 

I got a taco chuleta and taco de rajas. They were fine, I'm here to tell the tale, but if given the option of places in Old Town Goleta, I would probably dine elsewhere. 

Cash only. And for people who are religiously devoted to el Sitio, there are a whole bunch of others in town."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious. I've lived in the Santa Barbara area my entire life and this is one of my go to spots for good Mexican food. However me paying a little over $11 for a breakfast burrito is a bit steep, it was pretty average size burrito and it came with chips, and I was able to choose my own salsa from the bar but I still think $11 was a bit much."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Ordered an adonada burrito  and found out it only comes with rice, beans, and meat. So I paid for the extra lettuce, pico, sour cream, and cheese. I was starving and this hit the spot. Came out to almost $13 for things most other places include otherwise I would give them 5 stars. Place was clean, food was made to order fresh, and the salsa bar was fresh as well. Also not much leeway for first timers during lunch rush so read the menu ahead of time before you get in line."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Love this place primarily because I think I had the best burrito there. They accommodated my request and made a burrito out of one of their tacos. I would suggest asking for little rice and beans because they oftentimes overload on those in the burrito. Horchata was good. The salsa selection is great, they also have fresh grilled jalapeños/serranos? on the side. The chips are good, not too greasy. The employees are very kind, and the burritos are huge.

I think the food took too long to make, we waited about 20 minutes."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,Bomb and cheap. El Sitio over Super Cucas over Freebirds. Quesaritto is so good and their green salsa is prime. El Sitio supremacy.
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"I love El Sitio so much - pretty sure they are my favorite Mexican restaurant in Goleta and Santa Barbara. The Adobada Mixto is the BOMB, seriously the best plate of deliciousness I have experienced (hot mix of mushrooms, poblano peppers, cheese, and adobada with fresh hot tortillas for making your own tacos - add their medium spicy pico de gallo salsa and you are in for a treat. I haven't been able to order anything else from El Sito because this one plate is so good, I get it every time. Thank you El Sitio you guys are amazing!"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Pretty bad breakfast burritos... Or maybe I'm spoiled by the Mexican food I get down in SD? 

Anyway, we only came for breakfast burritos... but usually you can't go wrong on breakfast burritos right? WRONG! We ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito and a bowl of menudo. The chorizo burrito was nothing but 1 spoon full of chorizo filled with a shit ton of beans. Basically a bean burrito... for $8. So my judgement is based on the fact that we didn't get to taste the actual chorizo bc it seemed like there wasn't any in there and we only tasted the beans instead... not worth it. 

The menudo wasn't any better. It tasted like tripe in some oily plain broth ... No flavors. We squeezed a bunch of lemons and it got slightly better. 

Staff was nice. They were pretty busy. By the other reviews I'm guessing a regular carne asada burrito would have been better... we messd up by getting breakfast burritos."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"In my burrito-based explorations of the Santa Barbara area, I finally made it into El Sitio last weekend. It was quiet on a Monday afternoon, and I roamed around reading the wall articles about its origins until my rajas-con-queso burrito was ready. It was delicious-- a bit of spice, a bit of crunch, and the accessible trio of salsas rounded it out well. I will definitely return."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"Hands down, the best breakfast burrito in all of Santa Barbara...yes, really! Besides the fact that this breakfast burrito is so big that it can stand up on its own, it has just the right proportions of fillings. I always get the chorizo and egg burrito with avocado. For those of you who don't know, El Sitio has the best chorizo. No, it's not that mushy oily stuff you find in your grocery store. It's real Mexican chorizo that is essentially a spiced sausage. That's the way real chorizo should be. Their salsa bar has some of the best pico de gallo in Southern California."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Honestly this used to be my go to burrito joint. I paid almost $10 for a basic breakfast burrito, it was mostly tortilla, and the meat they put in was way overcooked. I was the only guy waiting for food and it still took 20 minutes to get done, and the salsa bar was mediocre. My friends went 2 days later and had some seriously underwhelming meals as well. Such a bummer. I won't go back"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Service attitude sucks. Wouldn't trust someone with a bad attitude making my food, obviously they don't want to be there."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"This is possibly the best value in the entire area for your Mexican food dollar. We love the #1, #12...and usually get rajas tacos to spread them around! Tonight we went with the shrimp- Brocheta y Quesadilla de Cameron and were blown away. VIVA EL SITIO!"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"I used to work in Public Health when I was in the military so I know if I will give negatives. 

Here we go:
1. The sneeze guard was not properly installed, their sauces and condiments(onions, and etc.) were exposed, not even a cover, a NO NO! I saw people come and go from this sauce and I can say that no matter how good the sauce is if it's dirty or contaminated, a turn-off.

2.  Their soda machine,there were signs of stains where it has not been cleaned for days.

Let's stop here. It makes me throw-up.

Food is a OK, but I experienced better ones. I did not see cilantro, maybe you have to ask for it, for a $.

Me not coming back here. I can find better Mexican joints than this place."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Better off going to Taco Bell. $15 for a quesadilla with no cheese, soggy tortilla and stale chips. Daylight robbery"
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"el sitio... more like el shitio. 

Walked in on my lunch break hoping to be able to enjoy a carne asada burrito with Guacamole...little did i know guacamole wouldn't be on the menu for me today... After asking all i got was a bad attitude and an incorrect order. I was 1 of 2 people in the restaurant. Not only that, i received the most bland tacos west of the mississippi river! DONT GO HERE. SAVE YOURSELF THE TRIP AND GO TO RUDYS."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,We ordered a breakfast burrito with eggs bacon and cheese  and potatoes. We asked for no beans! We also ordered a bean and cheese burrito. There were beans in the breakfast burrito and a 1/4 cup of beans in the bean burrito. This will the last time we go there. Always throughly check your order. The staff is unfriendly!!
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"I visited El Sitio for the first time today. I called in my order and the person who answered was very nice and had great customer service.
They said it would take 10-15 minutes and they were right. It was ready when I walked in. 
The person who rang me up was super nice, too.
We ordered one torta de asada, one burrito adobada, and some tacos de asada. We agreed that everything was delicious! So full of flavor and great quality.
All in all, El Sitio Fairview is an amazing hole in the wall, with warm employees and tasty food."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Menudo, I usually like everything I have tried from this place. But is just had the Menudo which they only available in the weekends. But I was not happy with it. Seems like they added the broth of something else they had left over. Perhaps the broth from the tortitas de camaron. Or something else, but is was not good."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,negative,"Have been here a couple times. The food isn't great just decent, just came here for a quick lunch break when I didn't want to drive home. Very bland meat or maybe I'm used to better lol. And the customer service was always nothing good or nothing bad just TODAY Was the last day I waste my time here. Ordered 2 asada burritos, While i was eating mine I felt a painful stab in my gum and pulled out what? A DECENT SIZE OF WHITE SHARP PLASTIC. I was upset but I tried to not be so negative. Maybe a spoon or the cream container broke and fell in there somehow and it's not their fault. But no I went back and the supervisor was very rude. I showed her the burrito and the plastic and she rolled her eyes and said they don't have anything with white plastic there so it couldn't have been in the burrito. She then said ""well what do you want. Another burrito?"" NO at this point I was beyond upset by her response and denial so I asked for a refund. She then kept on repeating on how they don't have any sort of plastic anywhere there so she doesn't know. I asked for a refund again, I didn't care that she doesn't have that plastic there because regardless it came in my burrito and was pretty painful. I didn't go to argue or anything just an apology and refund but no I got treated like as if I was making this up for some reason. She eventually agreed to a refund and then kept on muttering on how that plastic isn't even from there and they'll have to check cameras. Lady that's great to hear! I'm glad you will see what happened and realize how much of an asshole you were being."
Ifw5wqcChnL4zBigtR7NKA,El Sitio,Mexican,positive,"In a town that has no shortage of burrito places, El Sitio has got to be my favorite. Prices are reasonable considering what you'd pay at neighboring Mexican joints, and you get a side of chips and salsa with each meal. 

As a vegetarian, my options are pretty limited, but their rajas burrito is a solid go-to. Grilled onions and pasilla peppers, beans, rice, and cheese in a grilled tortilla make a greasy beast of a burrito that will never fail an empty stomach. Their tortas are also great. I'm a sucker for a chile relleno, and sticking one inside a torta is a win. 

The ambiance is forgettable, and sometimes a little too grungy, but you can't exactly ask for the Ritz in IV. The place fills up when there's a big game on, and their two HD big screens, reasonably priced beer, and ample seating makes for a great place to kick back and watch.

If you're just looking for a no-frills traditional style burrito, I'd recommend El Sitio over any other place in IV."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"great burrito, try the mixed meat; best salsa in town.  just enough kick to be fun but not overdone.  reallly like this place, easy all around..."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Overall it was just okay. The tri-tip was bland and a little dry, the chicken was moist but not very flavorful, and the sides could have been better. It's not the best."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Pretty disappointing.  It's actually a Mexican restaurant.  Chicken and beef tri-tip plates with tortillas, beans and rice.  Sandwiches only come in tri-tip.  Burritos.  Casual atmosphere, not very big.  A nice take-out/fast food kind of place.  

Shopping center parking."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"I used to love the burritos here back in high school and remember their salsa being super spicy. I came in last week (been about 6 years since my last trip) and was very disappointed. .the burrito is a child's size! The salsa is very mild. Overpriced in my opinion. For the same price you can get some bomb burritos around town that are much yummier and bigger. 

The chicken and steak were good. I remember it better though. Maybe I've lost the desire for chicken ranch throughout the years of discovering better places, either way I don't think it's that special, which is a bummer bc it's an sb local."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Good food, can't deny their ability to cook up great burritos and better tri-tip sandwiches. But when the restaurant gets packed and orders start overflowing, the food output slows down drastically."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,Good restaurant with OK chicken and solid tri tip. Parking is very easy and they are very quick. I used to go there a lot because it is always a good experience and the food is pretty good.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Hate to rate any restaurant so lowly, but finding a piece of pot scrubber (little silver metal twisted stringy thing) in the beans is showing their lack of care last night.  On top of that, the price for the meals is very excessive for the cheap stuff they are serving.  Better to get a chicken from Costco and deli cole slaw with a can of beans from Albertson.  The Chicken Ranch needs to clean up its kitchen and not leave it in the food.  I will post a photo of the junk."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,They were great and very accommodating.  The chicken and tri tip were excellent. We placed a large order for our girls water polo team during a tournament and the girls loved it.  It was a better healthier option than getting pizza.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"The combination of the wonderful smoky smell that always comes from this place + the awesome low-budget commercials made us expect more (seriously, how can you not love those commercials?).

We got a combo plate to go to try at home.  The interior is very nice, plenty of seating, and service was super speedy.

We got home, and opened the styrofoam box, revealing 5 small pieces of tri-tip, two pieces of chicken, 4 corn tortillas, and small cups of rice and beans.  The tri-tip was overcooked.  These guys got nothing on Cold Spring Tavern.  The chicken was delicious - tender and flavorful.  The beans were a little ""al dente"" as Casey described, but I thought they were good.  And the rice was okay.

Overall, not very memorable.  We probably won't be returning (if we did, we'd just get the chicken).  So unlike the commercial which claims ""it IS the best!"".... not so much :-(  We wanted to like it more!"
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,I go hear at least once a week. I think they put crack in the food as this place always pops in my head when thinking where to eat for lunch. The chicken is almost always juicy and tender (unlike El Pollo Loco) and the tri tip is right on the mark in flavor. The place looks like you are in a ranch and always crowded. The service is very fast. I barely have time to get my drink and get some salsa before a guy starts calling my number. This is a solid place in an area where you do not have a ton of options.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Decent food at a reasonable price.  I don't go wild when I consider eating at this place, but I know the food is consistently good and simple.  Good guacamole! 

Service is usually great and the new location is spacious, even if a bit awkwardly divided."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"I chose one star because I had to chose an option. I arrived at the location and had my whole family with me. I wanted to a sample of the chicken as it was my first time there and wanted to make sure it was what my family and I were looking for. However, they denied a sample. Really? I wasn't asking for a whole leg. Therefore, I wish I could not choose a star for the horrible customer service. I DONT NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant. We wanted to have a good time and ended up walking out."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"First time to Chicken Ranch.  I had the combo burrito with chicken and tri-tip.  I really enjoyed it especially the ""asada"" salsa with roasted peppers.  Nice atmosphere and good customer service.  I'd come back again just for the ""asada"" salsa.  Just a note, after reading recent previous reviews, no one was on a cell phone and all staff were pleasant. Thanks."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"There are 3 locations, and the Goleta one is cleaner and they give bigger portions, but the original location on De La Vina in Santa Barbara is also great.  Best Santa Maria tri-tip in the area, as well as the tastiest grilled chicken.  Not too salty--just right.  Generous portions of rice and beans, as well as a well-stocked salsa bar.  The combo plate will yield leftovers as the food tastes great and portions are generous.  The horchata and pina drinking fountain makes this reasonably priced eatery the best value in town."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Disappointing tri-tip sandwich. They had made some improvement lately so I started ordering it again. Now it seems to be back to the same skimpy portion, three thin slices of meat. Good flavor but over cooked. And $9 too. Order the chicken, the sandwich is not a good value"
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Having lived in Isla Vista for almost two years, I oftentimes didn't let laziness get the best of me and settle for a Freebird's or Super Cuca's overpriced nonsense burrito, but actually made the 1 mile trek to Fairview Plaza for Santa Barbara's Chicken Ranch's delicious combo burrito...even with the worst of hangovers. Being that I now reside in the Silicon Valley, I have yet to discover a place up here that compares. Every time I venture to Santa Barbara, I fight the urge to appease the rumble in my tummy with In-N-Out or any of the other dozen or so fast food establishments on Highway 101 so that I can sail into Goleta and dig into a combo burrito. 

Simplicity and consistent quality are two aspects of this restaurant that make it one of the best in its class. If you are looking for an uppity and highly service oriented sit down establishment with intricate mexican dishes, this is not the place for you. The classic barn yard ambiance coupled with the Tex Mex feel makes it more than an appropriate sit down establishment for small to medium sized groups. Although I typically would do takeout for reasons unrelated, there were always families taking advantage of the first come first serve tables. Although the menu offers very little in the area of variety, the fact that every item breathes quality allows them to get away with this. I personally recommend the combo burrito. Being that they cook their chicken and tri-tip constantly throughout the day, I never experienced a visit where I felt as though the food had been sitting in a warming drawer all day. The fact that they melt the cheese onto the meat before wrapping it up in the tortilla provides for a flavorful mouthgasm. This  is a simple, but uncommon practice that truly makes the overall taste. The fresh salsa bar allows Salsa-Addicts to load up on and unlimited supply of two varieties of their homemade salsa. I recommend the hot, as it is still bearable for a gringo like myself. In addition, the vertically cut roasted jalapenos available at the salsa bar compliment the tortilla chips that come with the burritos. 

In terms of bang for your buck,  you can't beat the Santa Barbara Chicken ranch for the ultimate combination of price, quality, and quantity. I have the appetite of a garbage disposal and I oftentimes would have nearly a third of my burrito leftover for a midnight snack. Being that there are multiple locations throughout the Santa Barbara area, diners can enjoy ther favorite Santa Barbara Chicken ranch dish near the beach or in the Goleta ghetto night or day! I only wish they had a location in Isla Vista!"
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Perhaps it's just because I came an hour before closing, I'm not sure, but my chips tasted like they had been in a plastic bag too long and my burrito was tasty, except for the fact it hardly had any beans in it. The chicken was good, but I wanted a burrito for the beans more than the rice. The decor of the Goleta location is better, but I think the Santa Barbara location makes their food better and more fresh."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,This place was great love coming here !! Salsa bar and pickled onions are so good !! Tri-tip and chicken plenty of food on one plate !! Rice and beans what more can i say yum!! Horchata !
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Decent food at a decent price.

The setup of the restaurant itself (at least in Goleta) is a little awkward, but I liked the 'ranch-y' decor.

They have a condiment and salsa bar, and everything I tried on it was good.

I wasn't terribly hungry, so I got the cheese quesadillas,  which came with chips and salsa.  They were good -- not the best I've ever had, but far from the worst.  

The chicken looked good, and I'll be sure to try that out next time."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"The Chicken Ranch is siiiiiiick!  

Go with the combo burrito.  It has both chicken and tri-tip, together, bundled up in perfect harmony.  

They are huge by the way, I'll usually have to finish my other half about an hour later.  The beans are good, the salsa is good.  You can get the meal if you like but why not just have them wrap it up for you?  

Auf."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Grilled chicken burrito was good and the salsa bar with various toppings was a nice addition; however, the price is a bit high for a basic burrito with beans rice and cheese. I'd go back. Full of hungry men as well; strange that there were no other women in there for lunch when I was there."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Food is okay and the service is good. The cashier is welcoming so no complains there. I didn't want tortillas so they are willing to substitute for another side which the cashier was nice enough to offer. 

If you want to beat the lunch rush get here before 12 p."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,Pretty solid chicken burrito. Around $9 and it's everything's packed in there with some pretty good chicken. A couple TVs and a mellow atmosphere make it a good lunch stop.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Came across this place while shopping in the center.  Family ordered tri tip plate, cheese Quesadilla, combo burrito and sandwich.  Food was ok.  Chips and salsa bar was bland. Busy traffic but probably wont be back."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"First off, the food arrives cold. Second, the meat is bland. Third, it is overpriced based on quality. Fourth, the chips were terrible and left an off aftertaste like they were made with rancid oil. We went at peak dinner time. Never eating there again."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,This place is a SB staple.  Huge portions and great meals.  Can get one meal and save it for half for another meal later.  Love it.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"I've tried the chicken and tri-tip dinner and the chicken burrito. Both were very good. The meat was cooked perfectly, the burrito was put together well. Sides ok, salsa ok. This is a step above Pollo Loco for sure."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,This is a great place for BBQ chicken or steak. The burritos are also very tasty. I recommend the combo burrito (both chicken and steak).
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"I ordered a combo burrito with rice, beans, tri-tip and chicken. It was pretty good. I recommend asking for a little or no rice in the burrito. The rice overpowers the taste of the chicken and the tri-tip. This place is really good and the atmosphere is fitting for the theme of the restaurant."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"This is the best chicken around. I always take a detour of the freeway just to get some of theat great ""Finger Licken Chicken on the Bone"" when I am in the area. The seasoning is to die for! In fact it is so good, I always find myself gnawing on the bone since I don't want the experience to go away. They have a great fresh salsa bar and the chicken is served with rice, beans, and tortillas. It is one of my favorite places to go when I am in the Santa Barbara area."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Nothing special here. Chicken is good enough but the tri-tip sucks: No seasoning and VERY over-cooked. Any local knows tri-tip should get a heavy dose of dry seasoning and be served with AT LEAST a small part of the middle pink & tender and succulent, but SBCR ALWAYS overlooks it to the point it's totally brown and totally dry, and mostly flavor-less.

And they charge about $8 for a meat/beans/rice burrito. Their fresh salsa is REALLY good, but if I'm going to pay $8 for a burrito for lunch (which I happily do once or twice a month, at other places) I certainly expect cheese/sour cream and avocado... $8 for beans, rice, and badly prepared meat stuffed in a tortilla is just terrible."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,Ordered the tri tip burrito which was delicious and very filling! The burrito came with chips with a salsa bar. Overall I was very satisfied with my meal and can't wait to return to try the rest of the menu
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Pretty good food. Had the tri tip burrito which came w/ tortilla chips. They have a self serve salsa bar. The salsa was just ok. The tortilla chips were a bit on the salty side. The burrito was huge. My husband had the chicken burrito. If we could do it over again, we would have split the order. Overall, decent for fast food."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"You can't go wrong with anything you order here, I usually get the chicken burrito or 1/4 chicken plate with a breast and wing. The chicken is obviously what they are known for but their friendly customer service is what makes me love going."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"My first time at Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch was pretty pleasant: we came around 1:30, and the restaurant had patrons but was mostly quiet. It's located in the Fairview shopping complex near Vons, Starbucks, Michaels, Bed, Bath, & Beyond, and Panda Express.

The way it works is you order up front at the counter, you can sit wherever you like, and you pick up your food from the counter when it's ready. There's also a salsa station with sauces and pico adjacent to the ordering counter for your needs. From what I understood from the menu board, you can order more sides as you see fit.

My boyfriend ordered the 1/4 tri-tip plate, and I ordered the 1/4 chicken plate. The set-up of these plates are pretty simple: you get your choice of meat, a pretty good scoop of rice, beans, and tortillas (either flour or corn) that come wrapped in aluminum foil. The tri-tip was pretty tender and juicy as was the chicken; so we both left feeling pretty satisfied. They were pretty good portions so everything was just right.  I think more than anything, we enjoyed the simplicity of the food. It was nothing too fancy or too out there, just really good food with simple presentation that hits the spot. So it's definitely great for a weekend lunch or even for ordering out. 

Would we come back here? Probably. I think it's definitely a place everyone living in the area should try at least once. I think there's definitely other places in the area that are more elaborate and have more options on their menu. But I think if it's simplicity and grilled chicken or tri-tip are what you're craving, then this would be the best place for you."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Maybe the chicken quesadilla just isn't the dish to get. It was a beast of a meal for $5, but the meat tasted like it was stewed without any seasoning. I guess that's cool if you're a total chicken purist and not into marination and such, but I'm down with a couple dashes of the herbs and spices. Thankfully, they have a fantastic spicy salsa, and plenty of it was put into play. Still, this chicken quesadilla was totally trumped by the likes of Freebirds, Baja Fresh, et al.

I've heard nothing but ""Marvelous!"" and ""First class!"" about the place, so maybe they'll get another chance next time we're feeling merciful."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Food is pretty good, but service is horrible. All employees have a huge attitude and will sit at the cash register on their cell phones, not speaking to you."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"The chicken here is very juicy and the skin is crispy- the perfect combination. I wasn't the biggest fan of the tri tip in comparison to the chicken, but it seems to be a popular item on the menu. I could live without the beans and the flour tortillas, and would love to see something like a side of sweet corn or other steamed vegetable. Also, I appreciate the prices, as I feel like they're very reasonable."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,It's ok. Not really special in my opinion. I had a burrito there and it is a bit typical. I will come back  to try their chicken to see if it is better and maybe the rating will change.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"I'm giving this place two stars because kids seem to like it.  But THAT'S IT.  In my opinion, the food is bland, and over-priced (for what little effort is put into it) and the quantity is sparse.  Save yourself a disappointment and walk a few doors down to the European Deli... a little pricey but WELL worth it."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,Good food for a good time in Goleta. At least I don't have to worry about hourly parking unlike in Santa Barbara. This fast prepared food to you restaurant in a shopping center will fill up your grilled chicken and beef craving with rice and beans and your choice of corn or flour tortilla to keep you full on the road again.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Last time here, chicken was the driest I ever had. 

I gave it a second chance with a coupon and had a slightly improved meal since I learned to completely drench it in salsa. The flour tortillas were also burned a little too much and stuck together only to fall apart extremely easily when separating and eating. 

Something is wrong with this place. Chicken plates are around $10, which is way overpriced for what you get.

If this place shuts down, I would not miss it.

Edit: Now that Sprouts is open nearby, I would rather go get one of their ready-made rotisserie chicken there (cheaper, tastier, more chicken meat) than come back here."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Wafer thin Tri tip, game hen sized legs and thighs, you must request salsa for take out or you get home with no salsa. I feel cheated."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Slightly better than fast food, but only slightly. The chicken doesn't have a good charbroiled flavor, it's actually a little soggy. They put tomatoes on the burritos that taste like they are from a can, the rice is pretty bland, and the chips taste and look like the ones bought in the market. It does have a clean dining room and outdoor seating tho."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Clients suggested this place for lunch. A quick peek at Yelp on the drive over indicated Tri-tips were the hit pick. Those reviewers were right! Eating here was a great option to fast food, or some of the other choices near the airport.
I can't wait to be in Goleta and eat here again."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Good burritos with either steak or chicken. Both are excellent. But you don't get many chips on the side. They should be a little more generous with the chips, especially for the price you pay.
But they have some of the best burritos in the area."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,Ordered catering for office lunch. Classic central CA fare: chicken and tri tip were great. Marinated onions and guacamole just icing on the cake! Delicious and very affordable!
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"I really like this place! When you step in, you notice that it really does fit the theme. People usually order to go but I like to take my time and sit down. The chicken skin is so crunchy and for the past five times that I have gone, the chicken meat has been nice and juicy instead of dry. The tri-tip was perfect in my opinion too because it wasn't tough at all. They even give you the choice between corn and flour tortilla which is a plus. I always go for corn but some places only offer you flour. The condiments are generous. You can choose how much to get and can choose between a variety to put in your tortilla.

The customer service is great! I remember when an old woman came into the restaurant and the staff was very accommodating to her. I went there the other day with my boyfriend and even though we only ordered one combo plate, the person who brought out the food also brought out another plate. The little gestures really mean a lot to me since it shows that they noticed that we were going to share a plate. 

They also do catering. It's worth going to so don't miss out!"
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Quick and easy tri-tip that will warm the cockles of your heart when the home made salsa is applied liberally. 

The Chicken Ranch may not serve up legal prostitution in Santa Barbara but you will get excited for the good taste and value you receive from this popular lunch spot. Although there is some mighty fine grilled chicken offered, I go for the tri-tip. Sure it's no Texas BBQ brisket but there is also no thick and spicy sauce added with patato salad. Just grilled meat and it's juices which add great flavor and a change from the heavy. Sandwiches are available but ditch the bread and go with a 1/4 or 1/2 lb plate lunch served with pinto, rice and hot tortillas. Dump some salsa on top and you have yourself a reprieve from the drive through bland. 

See you at The Ranch!"
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"Bummer! Wanted to get 2 chicken breasts with rice and beans but was told the only option was the half chicken plate with a breast and a wing. Can't get 2 breasts? No. Ok, goodbye..."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,Excellent chicken and a solid  tri tip.  Great beans and tortillas.  A really good choice for a casual bite or take out.  I particularly liked the salsa.  The Fairfiew location is in Fairview Plaza near the Von's - had to look to find it!  Will definately visit again when back in Santa Barbara.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"The Chicken Ranch is a decent place to get a burrito or a tri-tip sandwich. Not great, but definitely a solid choice for a casual lunch.

I like that they have the flavored sodas (whose name currently escapes me). I don't drink them, but I like that the Chicken Ranch has them.

There isn't much to speak of for ambiance or service, just that this is a good, convenient, lunch spot.

And the burritos are good."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Best place in town for a quick plate of delicious tri-tip.  Their house salsa is also amazing and they have good beans, chips and tortillas, too.  Love this place so much, we often take visitors who want a quick bite here and they always enjoy it, too."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Simple basic fire grilled chicken and tri-tip; served with pinto beans, rice and tortillas. Oh, and the salsa bar is good also."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,I had a delicious chicken burrito with some tortilla chips. Everything was so fresh and tasty. Mmm! I recommend this place without hesitation! Check it out.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,The small chicken dinner more than I could eat.  Loved the tender chicken. The beans and rice were bland which was fine because you can make as spicy as you want with their excellent salsas.  Husband loved the horchata  as a choice at drink dispenser.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"This was my first time going here. So we walk in, cashier stood there without saying hi or anything, mean look and her face and says what do you want, we order, no thank yous or your welcomes, nothing. Flat out terrible service. I ignore this hoping the food isn't as nasty as the cashier. Sucks for me because the food was just as bad. The rice was still hard and had no flavor at all. The chicken was completely dry. Usually you don't add chicken in the name of your restaurant if the chicken is hardly edible. My boyfriend got tri tip but he said it was more like beef jerky. Oh and everything is overpriced. Bean rice and cheese burrito 7 bucks? No. We will not be returning."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,I love chicken and I can tell you if you love chicken this is the place you where you need to come. It's charcoal grilled and flavorful to the bone. Homemade salsa brings it all home. I will be back every trip I come to Santa Barbara.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"I was looking forward to our catered lunch from the Chicken Ranch, I was told that they have good tri-tip and chicken.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.  They had grilled the life clean out of the tri-tip AFTER cooking it, to the point that it was a tougher than my ex-wife's heart. It had good taste but there was gristle running through the slices which didn't help much.  The chicken also had good taste but the drive to our location must have dried it out.
 I'm looking forward to going to the restaurant so that I can give it another shot.  Hopefully it's better in person..."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"So, I've been on a quest to find chicken for quite some time. I pulled to the side when I was driving up the 101. Did not know what I was smelling nor did it have a strong scent.

Went into""Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch"" expecting fried chicken, but negative. BBQ Grilled Chicken and Tri-Tip (tender and flavorful). I ordered up a combo and it was DELICIOUS!!!! Service was great too!

I was worried that I wouldn't be around the area for a while, so I ordered seconds ""Combination Burrito"" took a bite before departing, but it wasn't as good as the standalones. Personally, I wouldn't do the burrito again, but that might be cause I don't like beans much!"
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"I haven't visited the actual restaurant, but ordered food through sbmenus.com and was very happy with everything. The barbecue chicken was delicious and even though it's just me, I ordered the full chicken with enough beans, rice, tortillas and delicious salsa to last me a couple of days. Everything was top notch, especially the salsa."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,Its was pretty tasty. Hope you're hungry! They give you a lot of food. Great salsa. Chicken was cooked perfectly with great flavor.
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"My friend and I wound up here while looking for someplace different to eat. 

We should have gone somewhere else. He got chicken and I got tri-tip. Both were dry and salty and with small proportions. In addition to my three small, dry, tough hunks of tri-tip, I got tortillas, and a small dollop of rice and beans. I'm not sure what I was supposed to do with a tablespoon each of rice and beans, but they weren't very good either. I will not be returning."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,My family and I love it here! We eat pick up from here a few times a month. My toddler LOVES it. They're guac has improved a lot! I'm a fan
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Tasty place and they do something most restaurants try to avoid--sell small portions of single items.  If you just need a small bit of tri-tip, no sandwich or sides or anything, they'll sell it to you.  The inside is nice, though a little weird with all the security cameras, but the food is consistent and tasty.  I don't eat meat, but every one I'm gone with has said it is a bit dry, pretty tasty, and certainly worth the money."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Talk about the perfect hangover meal. Freebirds when you're about to black out, chicken ranch after you've come to. It's grilled chicken and tri-tip on tortillas--prices are based on portions. I used to come here at least once a week."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"When I need a quick and delicious protein fix, I order their combo burrito... You cannot go wrong! Add some guacamole & it's a 5/5. I am in love with their meat (both shredded chicken and carne asada). I am most pleased with their consistency. Never tastes nor looks different. Bravo!:)"
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"Usually go here for the amazing chicken, but decided to try their Tri-Tip Sandwich. I couldn't believe what I've missing out on all this time. Generous portions of tender tri-tip, coleslaw, fresh guacamole, wowzers!!"
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,"I keep coming back because I WANT to love this place, but I always leave pretty disappointed. 

Personally, I think the tri tip is only average. Dry. The rice and beans are also pretty bland and leave something to be desired. I'd recommend going with any of the burrito options, because they at least give you some cheese with it. 

I do really like all the condiments: salsa, pickled onions, hot sauce. I also like that they only have a few options as far as plates and burritos go, makes the choice simpler. 

Crossing my fingers that someday I will have an amazing meal here."
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,negative,It wasn't as I great as I thought it would be. Limited menu & salsa was all spicy. Some of us prefer mild salsa. Thank you
NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch,Mexican,positive,"I usually ordered the chicken burrito special that came with corn tortilla chips. The burrito itself was always really good. It had just the right amount of seasoning. I do not remember the exact price, but I remember it was decent for the area."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Good food and usually quick. Opens early for the hangover cure burritos. Parking is not ideal here and sometimes their salsa bar is out. California burritos are my go to, but tacos, gotta, and breakfast burritos are all good options"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Food is decent but sometimes too salty. But the service varies. If you get the middle aged guy, service is great. If you get the younger girl with the giant mole on her nose, the service is absolutely terrible. She's rude and really couldn't care less if you're a customer there."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Este restaurante mexicano es bastante bueno, es típica comida mexicana, es bastante bueno porque todos los días tienen un especial que es más barato, yo he comido el burrito mojado, es bueno pero la el mole que le ponen no es nada bueno. Los bota achola si son buenismos. Y el personal también es full bueno"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I love this place.  The food is consistently good and the staff are nice.  I recommend it to anyone on the mesa who wants a good go-to mexican restaurant.  I usually get the bacon breakfast burrito or the taco salad.  Yumm!
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Overall, I love this place. Fantastic, big burritos and they're willing to work with you on custom orders. It's more of a clutch go-to spot than a destination. Excellent, friendly service as well. Oh, and their breakfast burritos rock - large selection."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is my local, neighborhood burrito spot.
I go for the super burrito, but I love sour cream.
When I'm there, I see a lot of orders for the torta, so I may have to try that next time.
The people are always friendly here, and it's consistently fast and delicious."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Solid vegetarian tacos. Quick stop in Santa Barbara on my way up the coast. The tacos were overflowing with a deliciously perfect mix of beans and veggies. Super satisfying. Would highly recommend!
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Super Cuca's is not fine dining, it's not as well known as say another Mexican establishment in Santa Barbara, but is it a place to drive 90 miles for? 

Sure, depends on how much you like giant burritos. 

I love this place and to be honest I go to Santa Barbara maybe once a month (not strictly for Cuca's, well, once I did...) and I have a nice little routine down.  I drive up just in time for lunch at Cuca's and I get one of their super burritos (add guaca, typically with carnitas, but the pastor sometimes as well). 

They're huge! I keep forgetting, but we occasionally weigh food at my office from our local Mexican place and I'm sure Cuca's are bigger--I keep forgetting to ask them if they've ever weighed them.  They're so fat around they stand up vertically by themselves.  And they're delicious!  

In addition to that, they have a nice selection of salsas and you can buy meat and other accoutrements at good prices if family/friends find out that you're having Cuca's without them and then BEG to bring some home... just saying... 

Honestly though, cheap place, huge portions (honestly one meal for the day sort of portions).  Don't come here for light meals or ambiance, come for a good meal and then go outside, you're in Santa Barbara for god's sake!"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My primo burrito spot in SB, and after years of going to the one on the Westside, I was glad when they opened a location a little closer to home.  Burritos are still ginormous (heard that ""ginormous"" is in the dictionary now) and the nachos are on point.  As good as it is, it kinda feels like a there was a little something lost on the experience without the butcher shop and the Mexican groceries that's present at the Westside location.  When I was younger, I would engage in eating competitions with my brother to see who could finish a super burrito...I'm not as reckless with my health these days.  Still, no visit back to SB is complete until I've incapacitated myself after getting piggy on a burrito."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Food was good but felt need a lil more seasoning exept beans, taquitos were large looked like flautas, food was fresh Cooked and fresh ingredients . Aguas fresas on the other hand overly sweet.  It's a hole wall but has seating & bathroom. Pretty Authentic, might not return. Overpriced too a taquitos plates $10 without drink, restaurant price without atmosphere but still restaurant quality.."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Best breakfast burrito in town. Hometown favorite. When ever I'm here I have to get the breakfast burrito #10 with avocado. Good people behind the counter and fresh food. A staple in the community.
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Best. Burrito. Ever.

This is the white-washed Cuca's. Don't let it throw you, it is BY FAR the best location. 

They got rid of the Lakers stuff on the wall which is good....now if only they can put up some Red and Blue..."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I agree that this is the best Super Cucas location.  It's rarely crowded, and everyone is super nice.  I've been coming here since this location opened.  When you need a mondo carne asada burrito, and nothing else will do, this is the place to go.  The beef is rarely fatty, well marinated, and not too tough.  They put a lot of it on.  Load up about 5 plastic cups of pico de gallo, a couple of hot red salsa, go next door and grab a sixer of Negro Modela and head down Mesa Lane to the beach.  For several years I had to make a weekly commute to OC, and every week when I got back - THIS!"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"So my wife was craving some ""Fries with Meat"" with some modifications so I we went and I noticed they have a breakfast burrito special on Monday and Tuesdays get your favorite Breakfast Burritto for $5 rather than 5.95 or more. I like saving a buck when I can so this is great. Aside from that I had an Al Pastor breakfast burritto minues potatoes sub beans. It was awesome. Plus I love that typically Super Cucas doesn't charge extra for substitutions."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great burritos! Good price point. Quick. Large variety of menu options. Lots of salsas to choose from. Only downside is that you have to pay for chips, which surprised me, but it was an overall nice spot for a quick burrito fix."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Burritos are LARGE

Service is FAST

I always get the super burrito with Carne Asada, French fries and Avocado in it. 

It's delicious! 

Woo hoo! =]"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Absolute best hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant in SB. Love the fact that they have so many locations. Not the most attractive joint in town, but their food definitely makes up for it. Pro-tip: Grab a couple of their green salsas and order a super burrito with chicken and substitute the rice for potatoes. As good as it can possibly get."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Super Taco is the best thing on the menu. Salsa bar is alright. 

This is the only serious option for food on the Mesa."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"As many reviewers have said before me: California Burrito. Yes, I realize it's probably a very gringo combination, but let me tell you, it probably saved my life after a night of over-indulgence downtown. And the nachos are delicious. And the carnitas tacos. Delicious and cheap, what more do you need?"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Went here several times over the years, recently this Friday and my group of 4 loved this place. Prices did go up since my last visit, but the food was delicious."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Pastor tacos we're very good, Chile relleno was good, torta was alright. Was disappointed with the beans they don't have enough salt and not re-fried. We asked for re-fried beans and all they did was smash them no oil at all. Most of the food could have used salt."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Love this place, great authentic Mexican food.  Very large portions, very affordable."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Just a damn good burrito.  Big, messy, and tasty.  Only negative is they charge extra for chips...c'mon!"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I've passed this place many many times and normally wrote it off because it was often not busy inside and it is at the tail end of the Albertson's parking lot where nothing is open. 
One day, while my gf and I were shopping, we stopped and looked at the menu and it was actually quite promising.  The prices were above average for what we would normally pay but we gave it a shot anyway.  
We ordered asada super nachos and an al pastor burrito. The food came quickly and i barely had time to raid the salsa bar b4 our togo order was ready. 
When we got home, we found that the burrito was massive and would have fed us and our dog alone.  The nachos were just as large and we were both equally impressed with the overall quality of the food that we had gotten. 
For a $10 plate of nachos and 8.95 for a burrito, the price was a tad high but it was worth it.  Since we're local, we'll definitely be back for another sampling of the menu."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This was a great find! My wife and I are on vacation and visiting Santa Barbara looking for an inexpensive lunch. Got the fries/nachos with al pastor and it was really good. It's a little hard to find since it's back in a shopping center but worth to search!
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic burritos & nachos, huge portions, a lot of locals. Very nice place!"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Excellent food, if you decide to accept the Cuca's Super burrito challenge   I recommend that you not eat anything else the day prior to going. The Carnitas is the best I've ever tasted, huge portions, decent price, you will not be disappointed."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Oh how happy I was to roll back into SB after so many years and find Cuca's still standing (albeit in a different Mesa location than I was used to)!! It was my frequent stop when I was a local, and while there for 5 days I thoroughly enjoyed a daily meal with my family. My husband loves the burrito with fries in it, not my thing at all, but I got the super plate with chicken and was in heaven! Not even typical fatty stringy chicken. Just perfection served up high on a plate! We stopped by the Micheltorena store one night but didn't realize that they had no indoor seating (problem since it was raining). The Mesa interior is cheapish old-school booths but the food makes up for it. 

Bottom line: great food, great prices, nice staff, super consistent!! What are you waiting for?!

So glad to be back near great Mexican food! Might just have me moving back soon!"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Moved back to the SB area and in the past I was always fond of SCT. 

Recently ordered a breakfast burrito and what came out of the kitchen was not what I remembered.  The breakfast burrito was wet, slimy, undercooked eggs and extremely bland."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Well dang, I have 43 check-ins here and haven't written a review?  I guess I was waiting to get to 100.  We pretty much come here every Friday, grab a few burritos and head to the beach.   The location is convenient for that, the prices are reasonable, the food is great, and the staff is friendly.  I myself like the California Burrito: steak, french fries, avocado, beans, sour creams, etc.  Yummy.  The wife goes all boring and gets a rice and bean burrito, but then makes up for it with like 6 salsas.  Their salsa bar is really good.

When traveling I hate being led by Yelp reviews to somewhere nondescript and not too special, just because the locals think it's the bees knees.  So if you are tourist note this:  I love Super Cucas for all those things mentioned above, but if you are on your phone figuring what Mexican place to take your wife to tonight, this probably isn't it, unless you are getting it to take the beach, in which case, good choice."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I used to live just above this restaurant and never went there because I thought that Baja Fresh was the leader of the burrito revolution.  Alas, I only started going here a month or so after I left in 2001, and was that ever a bad mistake.  They have THE BEST burritos in the whole wide world.  My personal favorite:

Super Combo Burrito w/ chile verde, no sour cream or lettuce.  


That right there will fill you up and make you crave for it again.

Their salsa bar is okay, enough to get the job done.  the old owner had a bunch of laker clippings all over the wall, which although ghetto, gave it a distinct personality.  The new owner raised the prices about 10% and did decorating.  still worth the price, which is about $7 for a super combo burrito.  

Get your cholesterol checked after dining here."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great little taqueria in SB.  Ingredients seemed fresh, and huge portions.  We had been to Super Rico the day before, and that definitely seemed like a lot of hoo hoo about nothing.

It's a little bit of a strange location, at the end of a strip mall, but definitely a hidden gem."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Ive been going to Super Cucas since I got here a year ago, and it is my go-to place for mexican food. Not a single item Ive purchased has disappointed me, and the staff is always so friendly. I've been to all three Super Cucas restaurants and all deliver spot on. Their pastor (marinated pork) is incredible."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I had heard about this place from coworkers, they said how good it was so I went with a friend and we couldn't have disagreed more. I'm used to authentic Mexican food which this is not! I guess some people like it, like my coworkers, who have lived in SB all their lives so they don't know the difference."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"People rave about this place but I think it's overrated. I've been here twice, ordering breakfast burritos but honestly the food was too greasy and the potatoes made everything taste kinda bland. Meh. I've experienced better."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"GIANT breakfast burritos, tons of choices, really upbeat staff, and AMAZING salsa bar! Looking forward in trying this place again.  Also, exceptionally clean and spotless! Look forward in going back and will try to save 1/2 of my burrito next time for a later snack--it was just too good to stop! There are a wide variety of menu items and it would take a long time to try everything but from my limited experience, this place gets a 4-star review and quite possibly a 5-star once I have eaten my way through the menu more. Got to hit the gym before I go back! Cheers to good eats with a pleasant staff which makes everyone's day!"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Most of the staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast burritos are the best! The rest of the menu is pretty good (however if you like cheese, make sure to ask for extra)."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Good horchata and BIG glass for $2.50... Las Agaves's smaller glass is $4.00.  I also appreciated that the server asked me if I wanted ice in my drink ...since it was to go... I would have arrived home with a watery tasting drink otherwise. 

Carnitas torta had lots of meat and good bread.... taco plate also didn't skimp on the carnitas  altho I wish they would give two tortillas per taco.  Adding my own tortillas at home gave me three small meals from the taco plate I ordered.  My only complaint is that salsa bar was confusing ... lettering is permanent as to which sauce is where but the one indicated as hottest  held very little heat and the others didn't have much zing to them either .. give us some jalapenos or serranos por favor! Service is always pleasant."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place always satisfies my cravings for Mexican food! Great portions and quick service. I usually order the nachos with chicken and it's enough to share with 2-3 people..but of course choose wisely is whether you share or not ;) 

Not a fancy restaurant as it is more of an 'order to go' place. Parking is free in the lot next to Vons, but there's plenty of space on the side street.

Ps. THEIR TACOS ARE HUGE"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We tried this place based on great reviews. Our reaction was mixed. My husband had a burrito, and loved it, and would like to go back. I had a chicken quesadilla. The chicken was stewed and so drippy/soupy, it was very hard to eat the quesadilla. The flavor was just okay. We may try this place again, and I'll get something else this time. Service was excellent, and I enjoyed the salsas I tried and my big cup of horchata."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A very close second-best burrito in SB.  The burritos at super cucas are HUGE.  The place is usually busy and has another location in IV, but this is the one I always preferred.  Be sure and bring your appetite."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The service and quality are amazing! Way better than the Mitcheltorena location!! The food just tastes better, you can tell it's prepared by someone who enjoys their job. Super friendly staff!!! Keep it up!"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,i loved this place.  i would go here about once a week when I lived in this area. the large burritos are probably the biggest burrito I have ever had..which is a good thing. the quality was always good.  I loved this place and want to come back.  the guac/avacados are always fresh and the meat isn't grizzly.
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Super Cuca's is fast and cheap and generally pretty good. My main complaint stems from being a vegetarian. My boyfriend and I have gotten burritos and quesadillas there four or five times and almost every time one of us has found a chunk of meat or gristle in with our food. We probably should have known better, but we do now."
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love the breakfast burritos here, the chorizo with egg, rice, sour cream and potatoes is the best. It is my sunday football ritual to grab a massive burrito in the morning to hold me over all day!"
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Their burritos and quesadillas are really good and big of course. When I used to eat chicken I would order the torta at least once a week. I do miss the torta.
jZncFsMQdrq268OHq_Q6uw,Super Cuca's Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Our go to always. I need to branch out and try more things on a menu but it's hard to beat the Super Burrito with Asada or Pastor or the Nachos with Pastor. Fast and friendly service always.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,fantastic atmosphere everyone feels welcomed workers are fast paced and try to get u everything as fast as they can food was a plus will be back again
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Have not been here in many years.
Really nice surprise, great chile verde
And steak enchilada combo. Server 
Was attentive and friendly. 2 others
Servers asked if we needed anything
Looks like lots of regulars. I'm happy
To have rediscovered another Old Town
gem"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Two staples of any Mexican restaurant is rice and beans, and Pepe's has both down to a science. Coming from LA I was a little disappointed by the Mexican food in Goleta, but I was pleasantly surprised to find Pepe's. Pepe's has a solid staple of dishes as well as buffet specials that are great for eating on a budget. But Shhhhhhh there is a secret menu at Pepe's if you opt for bar seating, there is a hidden bar menu with very reasonably priced food in smaller portions. This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at and you should stop by to Pepe's in Goleta."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Very authentic, from the dishes themselves to the food on them. Dos xx on tap! Bar is very comfortable and bartenders are all ncie. One time, our server could have paid a little more attention to us, but overall a good experience. Rice in the salt shakers proves how authentic this place is. Tastes like Mexico!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"One of the best Mexican restaurants anywhere. Top notch food, service, and relaxing atmosphere."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Me and my friends come to Pepe's regularly, usually during the day when it's sunny to sit on the patio and drink their giant margaritas!  The margaritas are big and good, and while nothing unique, they never fail to serve good tasting food and drinks in generous portions.  The food is hot and fresh with quality ingredients.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful and give you baskets of hot chips and great salsa to start.  It's not the best Mexican food, especially not in Santa Barbara, but it's a place to go with a group for good service and a good time."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Had their Friday night buffet, same as the Wed - Friday lunch buffet, but great stuff! Especially the pork chile verde! Also great chicken enchiladas. Could use a little more than mellon for desert but still great food at a good value."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Pepe's was a total hole in the wall that my friends and I found last year. Great margaritas and authentic mexican food. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for great food, fun drinks and reasonable pricing."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Pepe's is my go-to place for happy hour with the coworkers. The margaritas are tasty, and I really love the steak and eggs (I like to keep it simple). The porbrecito is also a good choice, along with any of the burritos. I'd recommend it. The service is pretty good most of the time, and the servers are quick to refill the chips and salsa on my table!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Its changed so much from when I was little. We were here last night and out of 3 waitresses that helped us, ALL failed to deliver a smile or serve us in a timely manner, although they were hardly a full house. They looked miserable and when we got our check for two children and two adults she had added $20 on the tab and didn't attempt to apologize but told me they were from the ""last ticket"". Terrible servers but the runners and im guessing a manager were nice. Overpriced 'meh' food, bad service, never returning to this establishment. Hope they enjoyed the inflated farewell tip they didn't deserve.

$62 for a kids taco, order of nachos,
Tres amigos enchiladas, two green enchiladas and 4 cokes. WTF"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"MMMMM, this place is good! I think it's quite pricy... although, the BOMBness of the complimentary chips and salsa makes me forgive them a little.

Weird out of place orange slice with the dishes."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I've been coming here for years and seen the place go through its ups and downs.  The bar is reliable and affordable, the Sunday brunch buffet is delicious.  But don't get there late, as they often run low on items as the day progresses.  They're servers are warm and attentive with good humor.  They've recently improved their plating, menus, and uniforms.  I like their old school hacienda style and quaint neighborhood location.  Not too high brow and not scarily seedy.  Other places might be more authentic, but Pepe's is reliable, affordable and flavorful with big portions."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Terrible service, terrible food, no clean.  Our table had a lot of old and rotting food stuffed into the grout cracks of the tile.  But the waitress was nice."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I have been going to pepe's since I was a baby. Growing up it was our EVERY Friday night destination for family dinner. It is family owned, and most of the staff has been there for over 20 years. They have a great buffet option, also a fun and tasty Sunday brunch. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food in the Santa Barbara/ Goleta area, visit Pepe's! Also supporting local business owners is always a plus. 

If parking is hard in their small lot behind the building, there is additional parking in the lot across the street."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I have been to this restaurant probably 10 times. The food is pretty decent and the homemade tortillas are a nice touch. The buffet is decent. The location is not the best and the service leaves a lot to be desired. The last couple of times that I have been there, including tonight, Our server would not even look at me or acknowledge me, which I find to be very annoying, especially since I am spending my money to eat there. She would only look at my girlfriend when she would talk to us and one particular time we both noticed that she walked up to the table and she leaned around me and looked only at my girlfriend which was very insulting. Maybe I am old school, but I will not spend my money somewhere where people do not look me in the eye when they talk. #Gauchos  #ucsb"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I had lunch here the other day. Note to self: Control is critical when it comes to the chips here. They are good, and it's easy to fill up on chips alone. 
The tri-tip burrito was great. While it wasn't huge, it was good...which is fine with me...I do not believe quantity is quality.
The server was attentive and prompt. Was it the best Mexican meal on earth? No. Would I eat here again? Yes, and look forward to doing so."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I'm from St. Louis in town for work and was looking for authentic, great atmosphere Mexican food. This place nailed it. Great service and great tasting food. Highly recommend."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I have been going here since I was a little girl and the service has always been great. A couple of their servers have been there over 20 years and are awesome.

Their food is authentic, fresh and very tasty. I personally LOVE their Carne Asada and have had the buffet numerous times. They also have reasonable lunch specials that come with ALOT of food! LOVE their chips and salsa while you wait for your food! Their Margaritas are fresh, delicious and will leave you wanting more.

I honestly don't think I've ever eaten anything that I didn't like. 

The parking can be a little bit of a challenge, but that's just because it's in old downtown Goleta. 

All in all, Definitely NEED to try it."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Decent food but TERRIBLE service. Every time we come here, it takes forever for a server to take our drink order. Then it takes so long for them to bring the drinks, that they arrive almost same time as the food. Servers bring incorrect drink- not as ordered- had to go into the bar to have bartender fix it- who was less than friendly nor quick. Servers do not check in with you to see if you'd like another drink or anything else for that matter. Also noticed last three times we've eaten here that the margarita which comes in its own shaker is mostly ice and does not even fill one glass full. Used to be the shaker poured at least 1 1/2 cups. Not sure if this is because of the crappy bartender or some new stingy restaurant rule. Come on Pepe's- you can't rest easy on your old reputation forever- train your staff or hire new ones. Won't be coming here again."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"The food  was great,  the margaritas ok, the service was ridiculous. And not in a good way.  We had three servers and it still took forever to get everything. The ladies bathroom was nice and clean; my boyfriend said the men's was disgusting. There were hardly any patrons  (we were early), so no excuse for the service.  Happy Valentine's day."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Food was good. Buffet was a little scary as you weren't really 100% what was on there. (I think there was a deep friend been burrito?). We checked it out but went with menu options because lord only know how many people have sneezed on that thin. Service was meh. 

We were seated and within about 5 minutes a lady came by to get our drink orders. That was the last we saw of anyone for about 20 minutes. Then our soft drinks came, but bar drinks still not there. We placed our dinner order at that point because we were starving. About another 15 minutes food comes out. Keep in mind, almost 40 minutes and we STIL haven't got the drinks from the bar. Waitress said 'They're backed up"". How on earth do you get backed up THAT long? We could have walked to the ABC store and come back and still beat the bartender. Finally drinks came, but were made wrong. We didn't say anything because at the rate they come out, we'd be finished eating and in bed before they hit the table.

Took forever to check out and leave also. Server was nice but definitely not worth much more than a 15% tip."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"El sitio estuvo bien. La comida estuvo bien. Pero el servicio no fue el mejor. Se les olvidaron traer el postre de mi amiga y muchos minutos después regresa la mesera y le pregunta que si todavía quería el postre. Al recivir el postre lamentablemente no estaba tan rico. Alomejor regresaremos. 

The place was nice, I did really like it, however the food was just ok. The service was not the best, and there were only 3 tables. They had forgotten about my friends dessert, and later came to ask if she still wanted it. Sadly the dessert was not so great, my friend did not finish it all. We may be back, but not sure."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"We're from out of town & wanted a place locals go.  We looked on yelp and saw this place. We were so happy we came here! Food was good (only complaint is my cheese enchilada was soooo hot, the oil from the cheese made it kind of greasy).... but over all it was great! A great find!!!!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,Delicious Mexican restaurant for Goleta. The enchiladas are delicious and their Micheladas are so tasty!!! I always go back for the Enchiladas Suizas.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"OK.. Yelpers, I'm a fair judge on food and service...this is not the place for either.  I'm from OC and you can't fool me..try and serve poor mexican food and weak salsa and tell me it's good...Nah...  I mean a taco with hamburger instead of string beef...really???? I guess they serve buffet' style during the week and people like to get something cheap...but no taste beans..sorry not for me! I won't be back...."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Just thinking about this place makes me hungry! This gem of a restaurant is located off Hollister ave and has its own parking lot. We went in because my boyfriend had a craving for crab enchiladas and we searched everywhere to find a place that had something close. Pepe's has a mixed seafood enchilada plate that was delicious, though not all crab. I ordered the garlic shrimp because it was calling my name, though it was a little pricy. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, I couldn't get enough of them! We also had some tequila margaritas that were amazing as well. This is the type of place that I'll take my out of town friends on special occasions!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"several people in our group came here at separately for dinner and when discussed our dining experiences all agreed this place was really mediocre.  Seems especially surprising in an area with many Mexican restaurants.  Has an outside area, can accommodate larger groups, but the place seemed loveless (we would have left immediately had we not been so hungry) and the staff not particularly friendly. I'd say - try a different place.
Does have dishes just under $10 up to under $20."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Local Goleta spot. I love it here, it's like a second home. I've been coming here since I was a kid with my parents and grandparents. The people that work here have been here for a long time. Nothing has changed. It's still just as good as when I was 10 years old."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I would give Pepe Delgado's a 1/2 star (or none) if I could. We placed our order and, after 75+ minutes of waiting--with no information about the delay--we informed the manager that with no food in sight we were leaving. It's not that big a place and the restaurant wasn't packed. I don't think we missed much...the chips at the table were of mediocre quality. This was a huge disappointment."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I have been coming to Pepe's since I was a little girl, so thats 270 dog years. The food is always the same and the wait staff is pleasant. Do not come here for fancy smancy stuff. It is down home cooking. My favorite are the simple cheese enchilada's, ground beef tacos and chili rellenos. The lunch buffet can be disappointing at times because the food is sometimes cold, but the chili verde is amazing and the flour tortillas are hot and in abundance. I am sure the chef comes in early to cook and anyone that wants to cook for me gets 4 stars."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I went here with a group of 7 on a Wednesday night so it wasn't crowded at all. The service was quick though I was annoyed about not receiving enough menus for everyone in the group. Despite that, I ordered chicken taquitos and they were delicious. The complimentary chips and salsa were yummy and consistently refilled. Definitely recommend trying this place out!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"OK food, but ruined by poor, slow service.
Margaritas: Good, not great.
Chile Rellenos: Excellent
Burritos: Meh
Flan: Excellent, but do they really need whipped cream? Never seen this served on flan before.
Service: Pretty bad. Server hardly ever showed up. Very slow service."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"So... I eat here a lot.  It's kind of a local's spot.  And dare I call myself a local?!?

For me Pepe's is primarily a lunch spot: highly convenient (near work), highly comfortable, service is fast, and I leave sated, satisfied and more often than not, stuffed. Can't go wrong with the lunch buffet (currently only Wednesday-Friday), and my personal faves are pretty much any of their lunch specials (if I'm being frugal), their Pobrecito burrito, their Burrito Gonzalez, and anything else involving their pork chile verde (including their menu item the Chingadera!).  Their enchiladas menu, albeit a bit pricey -- worth the financial investment :)  And the complimentary chips & salsa -- yes.  Yes.

Pepe's is also great for hosting group lunches -- I've coordinated a few lunches for 10+ heads and they pull it off without a hitch.  They have a separate indoor room for groups, and can also accommodate in their outdoor patio.  They've done some remodeling in the past year/two years which has made Pepe's feel like even more of a gem of Old Town Goleta -- which it is!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"My family has been going to Pepe's for over 40 years. It was always a reliable if not adventurous place to eat classic Cali-Mex. We arrived at 5:30 on a Monday and the restaurant was wide open so we had our choice of tables. The host and wait staff were very friendly. We started with the happy hour house margaritas - generous size and only $4!!! The chips were fine, the salsa a little watery and tomato-ey for my taste.

I ordered the Relleno con Crema. The food came in a hot and timely manner. That's where the good stuff stops. The rellenos aren't battered-dipped (just for your information). They were stuffed with what was supposed to be queso fresco but it was hard and barely edible. The spicy crema was bad - very tart with no good flavors to it. The rice was okay, but the serving size was small. The beans were also just okay and an even smaller serving size. The plate includes 2 rellenos. I only ate most of one and, though I took a box home, I threw away they other. Not good enough for lunch tomorrow. 

My friend ordered the flautas with shredded beef. The guacamole serving was small. The flautas were a little too brown. She had the same issue with the rice and beans.

I'm so disappointed after so many years of happy memories at Pepe's!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Carne asada tacos were decent, with well seasoned if fatty meat, and sopes were flavorful. The salsa that came with the tacos was tasty, and the salsa that came with the tortilla chips was spicy and flavorful, although the chips themselves were bland."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"We needed to find a quick bite before we went to the airport and we're so glad we tried this place. Great food, great service and a nice outdoor seating area."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,My wife and mother in law and her goddaughter were hungry so we stopped in and we were so happy food was good service was good clean and quiet
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Absolutely terrible. Staff was extremely ignorant to the customer needs. It took us 20 mins to get drinks. The food was over cooked and greasy. Additionally every employee, except the owner, was negative and some rude to the customers. This combination created a very unpleasant environment to be in during the duration of our meal. I would never come back here, it is truly an abomination of a restaurant."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Our work birthday lunches are often here because it is buffet and everyone should be able to find something. The last few times it was super packed and under staffed. We requested water, platings, salsa numerous times. The food is ok, not the best Mexican in town. They do accommodate bigger groups, but don't expect the best customer service."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"It gets the job done. The house espolon (I'm guessing, ask Hernesto or he usually suggests it!) tequila is $4 a shot and actually pleasant tasting, as pleasant as a shots gunna be."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,Blegh... where to start. The food is just awful.  I don't know what else to say. Everything I've tried is just so so terrible. The drinks are way too expensive for what you get and they aren't even good. They should try to step up their drink game since there is a very popular and busy bar across from them!
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Food was great, atmosphere was nice. Wish the waiters would have been slightly more attentive though. They never came to refill the waters, or ask if we needed anything, and getting the check took 30 minutes. I would highly recommend it though."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Horrible service. The owner is rude and not helpful, managers daughter is very rude also as well as her mom. They were extremely smart with me. The owner needs to hire more energetic servers they are lazy. Also it was extremely busy and the owner came in got his food and left doesn't seem very well ran."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Pepe's is the locals place you want to slam and say something awkward about but just can't.  There are no frills here but you get what is advertised.  Decent Mexican 1960's style food, piled high with a basket of chips that never runs out, and big ol' Margaritas.  People may complain that it is not as she-she as down today SB, but it is Goleta after all and they have been serving it up this way since god knows when.  If you are hungry get the buffet!  It is decently priced and you can stuff your gullet till you explode.

Great place for students, being that UCSB is only 5 mins away.

Here is the hush hush secret that we love about Pepe's...They can seat a huge party fairly easily.  This keeps my family coming back! That's rare in SB/Goleta.  

The patio is quite nice and sunny and they have a full bar.  

There is nothing flashy here, but good honest food, prices and VERY friendly staff!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,The chicken and steak fajita was great and the prices for the amount but got was amazing  big mango pitcher margarita was great and only 18 bucks and if I ever come around here from NY again would enjoy a 2 try
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"We often eat at Pepe's when we visit family in the area. The food is consistently very good, generous portions and friendly staff. Great for large groups - we are usually 12+ and well accommodated."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Great place for large parties, can order from menu or buffet. Wonderful food and service at an excellent price!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"This place is an oldie but goodie! 
The chips are always hot and ready to eat with some great salsa, and the food is really authentic.  
I'll always stay a regular here :)"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,Quick and easy. A little greasy. I had the taco and cheese enchilada combo. The taco was great. The enchilada was ok but not cooked thoroughly. The chips and salsa were great. Service nothing special but nothing bad.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,good food absolutely no service.  Pepe's thinks that they are an institution and people will eat there no matter what and the might be right but there service is the worst of the worst. You couldn't get them to acknowledge your existence you can't get water you can't get more salsa it totally sucks.  But good food.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I ordered A ""Make your own combination"" Diner.  I chose a chili verde burrito and a chili relleno.  Everything was hot, fresh, and good.  I usually don't care much for the deep fried kind of relleno's I prefer them to be grilled and fire roasted.  But these were fresh and the accompanying sauce was light and spicy.  The chili verde was some of the best I've ever had from a restaurant.  It was very very tender.  I like it spicier, but very moist.  The rice was mild and fluffy, the beans were great.

Great  old timey bar and restaurant full of locals.  Good chips so-so salsa it's a little on the ""Pace"" side for me but it's still ok.  Service is N/A as I had a seat in the bar.  It's a bit loud in there especially with the marggie blender going almost all the time.  It is however what you would expect and want from a local neighborhood bar.  Eats for happy hour were a small nacho bar, with green enchilada, and chips and salsa.  Not bad for serve yourself free be."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Offers an okay kids eat free buffet tuesday nights(adults are $10.95, beverages are extra). Otherwise I wouldn't go. The offerings are pretty greasy even as mexican food goes. Not an exciting selection. Fatty cuts of meat in the chile verde. Service wasn't great either, had to go to the register to ask for some more napkins. On the bright side, they do have fresh fruit in the salad bar (canteloupe and honeydew melon) and they usually have the waffle bar going. Plenty of better mexican food places in SB/Goleta but, it's not terrible."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I've been coming here since I was a baby! It's a tradition in my family to come here on Sundays when they have their brunch buffet.  Delicious Mexican food, a waffle bar, and an omelette station! It's a tad pricey but very much worth it! It's all you can eat. I would suggest brining your own family :)"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Was here with my team the other day. Got the lunch buffet and I absolutely loved the pork. However, that and the fruits were the only thing I loved. The rest were just mediocre. One of my coworker has a torta and it looks pretty good. I might try it again for some other food. For now, it is what it is for the buffet experience."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Crappy service, saw our waiter once when we arrived and the cooks brought us the food."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"The Duke is out there searching for the best tacos in the land, and Santa Barbara is definitely a Mecca. There are many fine Mexican restaurants and taco stands in this town. The competition is steep. I've had some of the best taco experiences of my life in this town, and I haven't even started yet.....

Pepe's serves a killer Carne Asada taco, friends. One of the best you'll ever find. I'm not gonna call it the best, because I'm still searching, but these guys have it down. Chips and salsa were both excellent. The tacos were presented in an artistic manner, with a slice of mellon, a slice of orange and fresh chopped red onion on the side. The perfectly cooked beef was served on two home made tortillas with some distinctive salsa. 

One of the best tacos in the land, for sure. Good enough to excuse them for the slow service and highly irritating Halloween gizmo that went off every time someone walked by.... It's the tacos, folks."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Sitting inside the restaurant typing this. Wow tonight the service is pretty terrible. We walked in and got seated, waited quite a bit for a server. We ordered water and the buffet. We went and got food at the buffet and returned and saw there were no utensils. My bf asked a waitress for them and she never returned. So five minutes later I got up and had to practically walk into the kitchen to get someone's attention to ask for silverware. Got back and still had no chips and salsa, had to try to get someone's attention to ask for that. And then had to precariously put our glasses on the edge of the table to get someone's attention for water refills. I know they are busy but the service is terrible, and we have had several different servers, so we don't know who to ask for what. Food is good but please work on the service."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Eating chips and salsa as we speak. Avoid the red house salsa. It tastes as if it were conjured up using a can of Heinz tomato paste. I ordered a traditional burrito which consisted of chile verde smothered in cheese & sauce.

The burrito ran me $9.50 & it was quite small. It was delicious. The menu said it was served w/ fruit. They gave me a slice of orange.

I'd try it so say you did. Not my kind of place."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Stopped in while visiting in the area.  Service is decent and friendly.  It is a sit down restaurant with an attached bar and the food comes out in a decent time nice and hot.  I ordered the nachos with ground beef.  It looks small but is very filling.  I barely finished it and I usually finish an order of them.  It has real shredded beef but it seem dry, like it was overcooked a bit.  The cheese was cooked on a little to much as the it burnt around the edges.  My dad's burrito was pretty good.  He enjoyed his.  Overall, it was not bad but was not great.  Service gives 3.75 stars overall.

They have lunch buffet but I think it is weekdays only like the lunch specials.  The patio looked like a nice place to sit when it is warm.  The bar area looks cool with all the wood."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Pepe's has changed, I recently had dinner at peeps, they are normally very consistent with the food and the service, and it looks like they recently got new menus. I not sure what is happening with this restaurant, it could have been an off day but the service was not so good it was as if we were invisible and the food portions were much smaller then I remember. I am not sure if I will be back. Pepe's use to be a very good Mexican restaurant"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I enjoyed the food.
Service could have been better. The timing is hard for service, when they ask 
""how is everything"" right when I'm a conversation, Or I'm still trying everything is annoying.
It not their fault, just trying to do their job.
But then 10 minutes later when you want water or something... nobody is around...
Happens at any restaurant, such is the customer/server relationship.

The food was good, classic Mexi-American fair.

Salsa for chips was thin and one dimensional.

It's not cheap, but it was good and a lot of it.

The drink was really good.
Jalapeno Margarita, tasty, and strong.

Do I have to bring the check up to the cashier? can they take it?
No one... ok, I'll just bring it to the cashier."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"HORRIBLE customer service at this dump.  I used to like this place back before management took it the wrong direction.  After ordering a bean burrito, I was served a burrito with chicken in it, and ended up eating half of it before I realized what I had been eating.  As a 15 year strict vegetarian, this has never happened to me in a restaurant before, and it was a significant mistake on their part.  I politely explained the situation to the manager, but received only demeaning comments and sarcastic gestures in response.  Not only did she refuse to compensate me for my meal, but she also disregarded everything I said, and did not apologize.  I would hope that a decent local restaurant respects its customers more than this, but I was abhorrently appalled at her behavior - especially considering that I dealt with it very politely.  Don't expect to be treated well here."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I've been going to Pepe's for 10 years and my wife for 40 plus. No matter what I order it is always excellent. Fresh & tasty. My wife almost always orders the same thing, bean tostada and cheese enchilada and says they taste just the same as 40 years ago. The buffet is also great, but I can never remember which nights they have it. 

I would recommend Pepe's to anyone who wants a good Mexican meal and a relaxed atmosphere."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Love Love Love Pepe's! Every time I eat there it is always great. When I get a order to go it is always right on point. The staff is always so friendly. This place is so great!
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Great food and great drinks...Shoutout to Dylan for the excellent service from behind the bar!
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I have been going here for many years, I do have to say the margaritas are great and are consistent.thanks to the bar tenders !
 However the service tonight was Horrible (mind you it was busy but still no excuse) .. when I arrived with my daughter we sat at a table that had two chairs we needed 3 so I asked the waitress for an extra chair,( she said no that the chair would be in her  walk way),we sat anyway as we waited for our UPS  friend , 
I continued to order our drinks as we waited , I asked for a pitcher of margaritas which we usually order ,. she said sorry we can't order that .( I was like ... what ever fine .. I'll take a margarita .)
When my  UPS friend arrived ; get this all of the sudden there's room now for another chair and the waitress can walk thru . ( thanks to UPS))
And now they are serving pitchers of margaritas ... ( again thanks to UPS)

 We also ordered a bean burrito and that was wrong , 

Not sure how to spell our waitresses  name but it's pronounced like the wine  ""viogne ""
 When it was time to pay our bill my friend wanted me to leave a $20. Tip on a $66. Bill .( he paid the bill) 
I am all about leaving a great tip when deserved."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,This place is just ok...the bar and food are good but.....the prices are high! Santa Barbara beach high and zero view! Located in a industrial part of Goleta! Left here and went to Goleta pier restaurant and they have a view to die for and the same exact pricing in the bar?! Won't be coming back.....
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Pepe's is my favorite Mexican restaurant, and not just in Santa Barbara! Whenever I go to a different Mexican place I always compare their chips to Pepe's, and they never measure up.

It gets pretty busy at lunch time, but I usually get the lunch buffet so it's not a problem. When I order from the menu, I get the enchilada suizas. So good! All around delicious food and nice servers."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"A family favorite Pepe's has been around forever.  It never fails as a good place to go for low key, tastey mexican food. Seat yourself, order a margarita and enjoy! I recommend the enchiladas, suizas are my favorite but my dad personally liked the 3 Amigos. But you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, I've never been disappointed."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I have been here several times and had good experiences. Last night we were so disappointed with their service. Waited 1.5 hours for our food and drink refills were not happening either. We watched as other tables were seated, ate and left. Food was tasty but who has the patience for poor service?"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Carne asada tacos a la carte -- at $8.95 for two tacos seemed a bit high.  But they were L A R G E, the meat was very good quality and the salsa was excellent.   They were served with an ample slice of melon, which complemented the dish well."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,Pepe's is an easy restaurant to go to with a big group.  There isn't anything too extra ordinary about their food.  Typical Mexican restaurant with great margaritas.  We go there every time we visit our daughter at UCSB.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Such a hidden gem in Old Town. I love sitting in the bar area whether it's happy hour or not. The food is always so on point. I usually have the enchilada verde, sooooo good.  The happy hour is great during the week. They have a few TVs for those interested in sports. Great price point."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Pepe's is an excellent place to get delicious Mexican food and great Margueritas. The food tastes like authentic family recipes. The prices are affordable and moderately priced. The Delgado family has been operating restaurants in this area for many years.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"this place has awesome mexican food, but the service is questionable. depends on how they feel i guess. one time it took me 20 minutes to get a menu. then the waiter never came back so i walked out. 

there is this great waitress who can remember everyone's order without writing anything down, she should get a promotion if she doesn't own the joint already. 

their margaritas are awesome too!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Pepe's is okay. I have gotten chicken legs with dark mole here before and it was passable mole, though i'm used to the kind that makes your eyes water. I have been here with a large group for a work event and the sampler appetizers are good and they keep the chips and salsa coming. 

For vegetarian options you can definitely do worse. The veggie burrito is pretty good and the avocado and queso fresco tacos with rice and beans are pretty good too. This is a good place to go with a group or for families, etc. since they have a large menu. They also do the lunch buffet which seems pretty popular."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Free grinds during happy hour, large portions (which I usually split with my wife), and kicking Margs.  I usually go with the Tres Amigos (a beef, a chicken, and a cheese enchilada) and leave stuffed and content.

If you live around here and haven't been to Pepe's, you kind of suck.

Auf."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Yummy, but can get super crowded some nights.  The lunch buffet is a great deal, but I don't get it anymore.  I eat to much and feel cruddy all day afterwards. If you like good Mexican food, this place rocks!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Love Pepe's. The service is always pretty terrible but the food is good, and if you're not in a rush, it's perfect. A Goleta classic."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"We had heard that Pepe's is pretty good.  So after a long day of cleaning and moving we headed over.  The restaurant was pretty empty on a Sunday night.  We sat in the bar area.  

The chips and salsa were good and yes, the salsa is pretty spicy!  (although, a little sweet and a sauce-like consistency, sort of like runny ketchup) - but it was still good.  

We ordered a ""burrito traditional"" and fish tacos.  The burrito was huge and very good.  A bit on the heavy side, and with generous sides of guacamole and sour cream.  The fish tacos, by contrast, were bare.  Bare as in no cabbage, no lime, and no pico de gallo.  It did come with a little cup of salsa (better than the chips & salsa) and a mixture of cilantro and red onions.  Sides were a slice of honeydew and orange. 

I mean, yes, i get it, i ordered fish, so i wanna be healthy, but c'mon, how about a little ruffage to go with it?  But to be fair, the fish came in big pieces, not little chucks and it was very fresh.  

Overall, the dinner was very good and we were satisfied.  I would go back again for some margaritas.  :)"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"All you can eat (lunch) is fairly priced ($12.42, after tax).  Variety of food is low; had pork and pork enchiladas.  GREAT cheese enchiladas with lots of cheese not like other places where you can only taste the tortilla.  Waiters are friendly but service (for drinks) was a tad slow.  Quite atmosphere."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Awesome margaritas from a beautiful vintage bar. Great service and good, traditional Mexican food. Love the Carnitas too. Every time I am in SB, Pepe's is on the list!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Go here for their lunch buffet. Lots of options, and plenty of food for a good price. The single entrees are a little overpriced. It's clean and they are on top of refilling the popular items. They have a nice little outside courtyard to sit in too."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"This was a tough dinner.  My husband ordered his plate and was given the option of chicken or tri-tip.  He asked if he could have both, half and half. ""No"".  Then we wanted a tri-tip taco (they have tri-tip burritos, tri-tip nachos, tri-tip stuffed peppers). ""No"".  Alrighty... chicken taco it was.  Then, in a nearly empty restaurant (two other couples) we waited over 30 minutes to get our drinks and chips refilled.  There are just so many other really good Mexican restaurants in SB/Goleta... this wasn't worth the $40.00 for two people."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I have been going to this restaurant since I was a very small child and I still love it.  Service is good, prices are good but what really knocked me out was when I ordered catering from them this last weekend for a baby shower.  I was not charged an arm and a leg and the food was hot and fantastic.  I requested to borrow their chaffing dishes and they only charged me a nominal fee and the price of sterno.  I was also sent along with these awesome insulator lockers that kept my trays of food hot for hours.  Will definitely order catering from them again!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"This place is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Santa Barbara area. It is consistently hot, fresh, and delicious. Every dish my wife and I have tried has been great. The atmosphere is quaint, and the waitstaff is friendly. We especially enjoy eating in the bar, where it is cozy and the staff is exceptionally attentive. Not a bad margarita either!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Apparently the only thing good here is a Margarita. We have come here for years, it has been our go-to Mexican restaurant. Until tonight! Cold gray hamburger meat on a taco with fake anemic cheese, and a tiny rubbery oul laden tortilla. Watery pink refried beans. Tiny portion of paste... called rice. Rellenos were cold, hard and swimming in yellow grease. One bite was all it took.... disgusting. I ordered ground beef tacos and at 5PM, I was told they didnt have ground beef. I had a bad feeling so I didn't order anything. When my companion's food arrived, I was glad I didn't order. I tasted the beans, and now , an hour later, my stomach is churning. Waitress was very sweet. Oh and definitely overpriced."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,The carnitas taco lunch special was good and priced right.  The bar area looked awesome so I'd like to check it out some night if I'm back in town.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Pepes food never disappoints!  This place is an awesome mexi  cantina dive. The only complaints I have are the margarita's need a little help. Other wise if our looking for some good comfort Mexican food and a mellow local vibe. This is the place. They have a separate bar with 2 TV's. Good chips and salsa too!
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"The chips and salsa were great. The service and their food not so much. The waiter was pushing us to order despite being the only other people there. When we finally ordered and our food came I was completely disillusioned. PEOPLE PUTTING MEAT, BEANS AND RICE IN A FLOUR TORTILLA DOES NOT MAKE SOMETHING MEXICAN. The ""pobresito"" burrito I order lacked spices and overall taste. For $9 for a burrito I was expecting something better than shredded beef on a tortilla. And to top it all off I ran out of my drink and it took a good 15 minutes for the waiter to refill because he was too busy socializing with the rest of the employees. Bad Service and food is mediocre, take your money elsewhere."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"2.5 stars... but I rounded up because the service is always good. 

The food is ok. The last time I went I found a few hairs floating around. Some in the chips, some after I got some rice from the buffet. Granted it's a very open dining area, and they have a decent selection of food in their ayce buffet:
cheese enchiladas, baked rellenos, soup, chicken, broccoli, chimichangas, rice, beans, salad bar, taco meat for hard shell tacos or tostadas...

I've had a few of their specials (Lunch special #4 and another one) and they weren't bad. 

But the hairs turned me off."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Had the pleasure of visiting Pepe's for the second time and found my experience to be just as good as the first. I ordered the Pepe's burrito with carne asada, which was quite filling and VERY yum! :) Definitely worth a try if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed! Friendly and attentive staff who made sure my glass was never empty...I will DEFINITELY be back again!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"PePe's RULES!!! Love love love the lunch buffet and just love the food in general. Good, quality Mexican food with excellent, friendly service. Any time we have family or friends come from out of town, we take them- and they love it too! Price wise, probably the most reasonably priced restaurant in SB & Goleta combined. If you like Mexican food, you will not be disappointed!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,I came here for an enchilada and left digusted. I got my meal to go and it was unedible. I had to go somewhere else for dinner. The cheese enchilada was like they poured marinara and cheddar on a tortilla and called it a day. The sauce was so gross and I was really disappointed especially at $4.70 a piece.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Best Mexican food! Try Pepe's burrito with grilled chicken...spicy and delicious! Nice servers. Love the food.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Really good food, okay service. Was in Santa Barbara from out of town and my boyfriend craved Mexican. I had the beef tacos. It was a little expensive, but yummy."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,negative,I came here for Sunday Brunch with family.  This place gets popular but you don't get crowded out.  The menu is large and they have lots of options.  They will also do subs if you want.  All the food I saw looked good.  I did not try to the buffet but it looked good.  However I did get the fajitas which were nice and large.  The steak was about average quality as were the shrimp. Both were light on the seasoning.  The prices are not bad.  I would come here again.
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"yummmmmmmmmmmmm, their buffet is da bomb, it gets pretty crowded at lunch since its a work favorite lunch stop, so you should get there a little early, but their cheese enchiladas are sooo delish, their salad bar is amazing too with this cilantro dressing, and cheap, defineteley hidden secret of Goleta/Santa Barbara."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I came for the lunch buffet and left with a full and happy belly.  It's a simple buffet, but I enjoyed it.  If I recall correctly, it offered: rice, pinto and refried beans, cheese enchiladas, chicken enchiladas (which were kinda dry), bean and cheese mini chimichangas, pork verde, taco meat, flour and corn tortillas.  I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting something, though.  It also had a salad bar.  

The staff was nice.  You seat yourself and they will take your drink order and bring you chips and salsa.  Plates were cleared quickly.

I really liked the environment.  It's an old building, but it's kept pretty clean.  It was a relaxing atmosphere.

Lunch for 2 was 23 bucks but I also had a soda."
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Good food, good prices, wide selection, and friendly staff. I looked around the place, and it was a good mix of families and young people or couples.

Most things on the menu can be ordered in combination or a la carte. Fun decor. The salsa that comes automatically with chips is surprisingly delicious, if a little bit thin. This was a nice find using the Yelp app on my friend's iPhone!"
6TciI6uBdrd8z1av1YleLg,Pepe's Mexican Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"My old roomate, who is Mexican, took me there and it became one of my favorites. 

The setup is very friendly and layback where you seat yourself, and enjoy some family style Mexican food. 

The service is always great, and food comes out quick. Large portions with good prices, great deal to me overall."

Minus 2 for the food never being hot, not spicy hot but temp wise. It's always cold. That not only worries me but it's just not good. It would be good! Just get it together! I know you've had a hard time lately after being sabotaged by the evil Monsanto corporate giant so I want to support you AND I want at least one healthy fast food alternative. Turn up the heat Chipotle."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"Splurged for an order of chips and queso (which is like $4), was only given chips with NO queso, didn't realize until I got home, and didn't wanna turn around and go back. Such a bummer. Just love wasting money and getting ripped off."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"Customer service is clearly not their first priority. Went in to order and nobody walked up to help (the restaurant was not busy at all. Just 1 person ordering) while I saw other employees standing talking to each other by the cashier. The Once a server came she was serving me very small portions. I've been to many chipotle's before and I ""know"" what a normal serving size looks like. When I asked if I could get a little more she just rolled her eyes and then served a little more. The guac did not fresh either, I got some on my bowl but it had some brown on the top like it was sitting there for a while."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"Employees are a bunch of cheap bastards when they want to.
The guy that made my bowl put so little of everything I was about to tell him to eat it himself.
(Damn cheap stupid little bastard.)What makes me mad is that the guy behind me got a huge bowl with a lot of everything  without asking for anything extra, the employees should be equal with the amount of food they serve to the customers."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"Horrible . Got stomach pains before I even left the building, had come after getting a pedicure and while I Was eating with my friend, we agreed the food tasted bland and cold and a little off. We were not pleased. To top it off the staff looked bored out of their minds while making it. Definitely not the chipotle experience I'm used to. Given this place a couple of chances and I'm always left un satisfied. I'll stick to the downtown location, little extra drive is worth it to make up for the mediocre food service/food quality here."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,PLEASE Share your experiences with this location with chipotle corprate before someone dies from food poisoning.
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"I've only been going here the last couple months, but have been enjoying this Chipotle so far. The burritos aren't wrapped tightly and the amount of guacamole varies, but I'm really liking the salads. You can see from my photos that this chipotle hasn't been skimping. 

The chicken is my favorite so far and I hope to try carnitas soon. 

Did you know chipotle also has cilantro? It's under the counter, ask for it at the end."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"To put it mildly, thus chipotle sucks. The employees are slow, inattentive, and unenthusiastic. I waited in a line with 10 people for 30 minutes, when typically, other chipotles take less than a third of that time. Pathetic. Many of the staff members are incompetent, and cannot roll a burrito or fill an order correctly. If you're short on time and money, don't waste either here. Only giving one star because I can't give less."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"Dangerous. I'll cut right to the chase; my daughter (2 years old) spent more than a week very very sick because of raw chicken from this location. Raw chicken is not a matter of recipes or authenticity, its about possibly getting someone killed. It comes down to one thing; an abundance of young, careless, preoccupied staff. During the same visit (before realizing the chicken was raw) I also discovered my burrito had its foil written on so hard they sharpied the burrito itself. Such carelessness for basic food safety is unforgivable and as far as I'm concerned the location should be shut down to address the multitude of issues that go from annoying to dangerous. I recommend no one risk eating here for any reason."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"I come to many chipotles, and this one really disappointed. The carnitas looks very watery, and the rice very dry. The lettuce looks extremely wrinkly and sad. The worst thing was the portions. The lady gave me a half a scoop of rice, barely any carnitas, and a measly scoop of mild salsa. My friend got a bowl and it barely reached the brim of the bowl. It usually piles higher than the brim. We usually leave chipotle full and satisfied, but for today, we left hungry and frustrated."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"I used to like coming here. But lately it has been very unorganized. There's food running out and staff are barely making it. I see the meat cooking has been left unattended. Guacamole is out and someone is making it, which is why I'm waiting and observing. People are coming in and g straight back doing a lot of talking to the guy making the guacamole. Looks like by the time I get the guac, my burrito will be cold. 
I used to come here once a week. Then every other week, now... Not sure when I'll come back."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"This restaurant needs to be clean, I mean like literally a deep cleaning starting from the restrooms and finishing up with the tables, employees were not even busy and all they were doing was staring out the window like there was nothing to do, no straws, no clean tables on where to sit, had to sit outside ‍, smells horrible and to top it off their doors handles and door glass were extremely dirty! Maybe next time I'll listen to the reviews instead of giving them a chance...will not come back"
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"UPDATE. 

After my child got food posing from raw chicken and was sick for nearly 2 weeks I called and reported this location. This is our favorite chain restaurant it's upsetting that the closest location is now off limits because of poor management and food prep. After speaking with a customer rep regarding our issue she said that the regional manager would be paying them a visit. She tried to offer a gift card for a free meal. I declined. It really bothered me that I had to urge them to do something and they thought I could be bought off with a $20 gift card. My 2-year-old spent the better part of two weeks unable to hold down food. This left a horrible taste in my mouth. Won't be back."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"I've been going to this Chipotle for nearly 2 years. I go to Chipotle an average of 3-4 times per week. I tend to order the same thing and had the worst experience today. A Chipotle worker (who I later learned was the new manager) was behind me in line. I ordered like I always do.  When I asked for cheese on the side, she jumped in and told the Chipotle worker to only partially fill the cup with cheese.  Uh, you didn't ask me if I wanted less, did you? Then, when I went to pay, for the first time ever, I was charged an extra $1 for a partially filled small side cup of cheese--really?! When I asked why I was being charged extra for the cheese since this has never happened in 2 years not to mention I order this same way at every other Chipotle and have never been charged, that's when the lady behind me jumped in again and said that she's the new manager and they were going to start charging for sides like this. Ok, so I told them to just remove it from my order then, but I was not happy.  The new manager wasn't particularly nice in her handling of the situation.  I have 2 other Chipotles in my immediate area and will go to them instead since I will actually get a full side cup of cheese there and not be charged extra for it. I've probably been to more than 10 Chipotles, and never encountered a manager like this one before...no customer service or loyalty skills."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"Just tried chipotle for the first time. Made an order online. Very expensive for an American Mexican food. Canceled the order, they wanted 9.30$ for a tiny burrito. Go to Supper Cuca's and get an authentic supper burrito, it's huge!  Maybe a dollar more. One burrito could feed two people"
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"This is the only Chipotle location I refuse to eat it. Undercooked chicken made my child sick for a week. Never chancing it again. 

The downtown location is ""ok"" but not nearly as good as the Ventura location."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,Terrible customer service. Food was just as bad. I was never greeted and the restaurant was a complete mess. I will never return to this location.
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"This Chipotle Staff gives little portions.
The place is clean and nice. The staff is a little friendly."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,positive,"The food is always good and fresh. The service is good except when they try to rush you down the line ( even when there is no one behind you! Before you can finish saying ""Flour"" they quickly ask ""what type of beans""! Annoying. The tables are usually wiped off and clean. They had a gas leak about 6 months ago and didn't bother to put a sign on the door so a bunch of us were all waiting outside for about 10 minutes at 10:30( when they open) and the workers just walked by and looked at us. I left scrambling to find somewhere else to get lunch. I was pretty upset and complained but never got a response to my complaint. I later found out from a worker what happened that day. 

Also there is a gym across the street and sometimes smelly dudes come over and stink up the place. I had to pack up quickly one time when some gross smelly guy sat down next to me. Gym= 2 hours, deodorant= no, smell= putrid. It was a huge turnoff and I think about it every time I pass by and usually eat at Panda instead or get my food to go!"
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"Chipotle has great food, this location has horrible proportions. I ordered a bowl and the girl pit half a scoop of rice with half a scoop of beans, didn't even fill up the base of the bowl. It's sad that I paid full price for a mediocre bowl that's almost $10"
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,positive,"Stopped here on my way back from SLO. It's your standard Chipotle. The food was well prepared, tasted great and was made quickly. The line was super slow though because the people on the counter didn't really know how to help a mom with 3 little kids. If there were more than 2 people on the line, then they would have processed more people."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"I miss Baja Fresh. Chipotle, if your going to have  customers ask for every little thing, at least put your employees through, even a brief customer service lesson. It might be helpful!"
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"My mom picked up my to go order. I think They thought this food was for an elf.  I got a to go bowl chicken rice beans cheese sour cream, they only filled half of the bowl. I'm not kidding.  Here's a picture. Haven't taken a bite. These cheap asses swear the beans and chicken are coming out of their paychecks. Avoid this place unless you want to leave hungry."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"You would think a place that is known for jumbo burritos would train their employees on how to roll a damn burrito. But no at this location their employees sloppily flop over the burrito put the 3 sq inch piece of foil over it. THEN when it collapses and oozes on the contents on the flat top they stick their disgusting fingers inside the burrito jam the contents back in. I can handle a lot but finger banging my burrito is where I draw the line. When I brought this not only the the burrito makers attention but the cashier too the responce was ""well wtf do you expect me to do about it"". Helpful I know. I convinced her to give me a bowl and a fork and then she didnt actually give me a fork. Save yourself and go somewhere else. The thing is that I gave this location 3 chances and I received the same basic lazy slopy disgusting experience. Not acceptable especially for Chipotle. NEVER AGAIN!"
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"Decent  quality cheap with the protein portions, guacamole is good but an extra $3 for a really small portion. No salsa bar. Salsa is weak. Other than Habit only fast food I chose to eat."

tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,positive,My favorite Chipotle location. Not that the others are bad. But the La Cumbre one is the most flavorful food of any location I've been to. I will be back whenever I'm in town.
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE CHIPOTLE CORPORATE TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES!! This location is filthy with the least friendly employees. The food is not prepared right - I don't want to get sick so I am rethinking ever visiting this location again. The counters and the entire dining area are FILTHY. The employees don't smile, look miserable and mean and really could care less about your experience. I will go to Panda or the Habit any day if I have to get food at La Cumbre. Pity because I love the downtown and Goleta locations."
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,negative,"I love Super Cucas, but being on a diet the past month, I wanted to go lower cal than my typical giant burrito at Cuc's. I thought I'd try Chipotle after having it once about 5 years ago. Ordered online, food was ready in 10min when I picked up (good), but was bland, cold and soggy when I got home (bad). 2/3 of each of the 2 kids meals I ordered was missing, the chips and drink that were supposed to come with each. Not worth going back for, but incredibly annoying. When I called, they were nice enough to credit me a future meal, but do I really want to go back?"
tS47dXDlx9t-6B_F56cKUA,Chipotle Mexican Grill,Mexican,positive,"The last two times I've been here didn't feel like a ""fast food joint"" great service, great food, and they even gave me a buy one get one free coupon. Thanks guys, I'll be back!"

onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Jazzy & Jesse first stop before NorCa for food . We are a bit snobby when it comes to eating but I can honesty say...LOVE THE SPOT. Simple and homey food in the best of ways. Long lines but above average service and speed at awesome prices. Great family style envoriment for beach food. Good value and good eats! We recommend! Especially the grilled shrimp burrito! The burgers looked delightful....might be in store for that on our way back down the coast!
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Food: A+
Service: A+ (FAST!)
Atmosphere: A+

This is everything you want in a beach burger joint! GREAT burgers, fries & rings with a stellar combination of seafood and shakes. Prices are very reasonable! My whole family left happy! 
Be prepared: They ONLY take cash, but they have an ATM on site."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Best burgers in town. Great spot to go to on a hot summer beach day. Worth the drive and the wait. Highly recommend it.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Have been coming to The Spot since I was a kid, and throughout the years it has never disappointed. I'm a huge fan of their fish tacos and onion rings. Yes it's a bit steep, but hey, you get what you pay for! I'd like to try their chili bowl next time."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Delicious and great location! I always take my food across the street to Island brewery to enjoy my burger with a local beer! I would recommend going for the burgers, because I've had other options which weren't as good. Cash only, but atm in location."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"When in Carpinteria, visit The Spot for some good char-broil and Mexican. The first time we ordered the taquitos from the take-out menu folder at Island Brewing Company. Needless to say, they hit the spot after a few rounds of brew. The second time, we were on our way out after an extended weekend of beach camping and decided to grab some breakfast burritos for the road. Once again, they didn't disappoint. The ham burrito had a full ham steak and the sausage burrito had three sausage patties. JL got the green sauce, which turned out to be better than the red sauce I ended up picking. Too watery for my taste.  Maybe next time, I'll try the pico de gallo. Can be on the pricier side, but location and convenience are key. Can't wait to revisit."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"I would have given this place 2 stars but cash only and the quality of their rest room sealed the deal for me.  I ordered the chili relleno burrito and it was like a soup burrito the best part about it was being amazed that the burrito could hold in soup without it being soggy or leaking.  What good does a water tight burrito do you?  NONE.  Who wants a soup burrito?  NOT me.  Maybe I should have ordered a burger instead of a burrito and maybe they specialize in burgers and not burritos!

The rest room was horrific.  How about they take some of the money they pocket and don't pay tax on because of the cash only business and put in some decent restrooms?  

The place looks like a old school beach burger ""spot"" but it is not worth the money at all...in my opinion!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I heard about The Spot in Carpinteria from a friend and when my boyfriend and I moved there we decided to check it out. It did not dissapoint - that's for sure. Great burgers and shakes...I have not tried the hot dogs or chicken but I did have a burrito once which I thought was weird for them to have on the menu but I wasn't really in the mood for a burger but had to order something so I thought I'd give it a try and it was awful!  No flavor, dry, nothing good about it at all.  I'll stick to burgers and shakes from now on.  I don't like the fact that they only take cash because I rarely carry cash with me so that is a little annoying. There's probably an ATM near by bu I haven't bothered to check."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"It's a little hamburger stand.  I had a chili cheese dog and an order of onion rings. The chili was pretty good, the bun and the onion ring were a bit over done.  CASH ONLY!!!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Such a fun California beach experience. Their burgers are delicious... we cant help but stop here for a meal every time we are near Ventura or Santa Barbara... so so yummy and always busy on the weekends and in the summer. Dont fret when there are long lines... worth the wait for sure.

Be sure to bring your CASH! or you will have to take a short walk to the liquor store down the street for the atm. It is worth it for sure. Everything there is good and you can even walk your meal to the beach for the added experience."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"So a year later, but nothing's changed. It's an okay ""spot"" (pun intended) to stop for a bite while playing on the beach, but it's a typical burger and fries and rings. Simply okay."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I gave this restaurant 5 stars because it fulfills what it is - a beach dive in a great location that serves classic dive food.  If you are looking for this then you will enjoy your stay.  If you are thinking gourmet food and dining experience then this is not your place and you will not agree with the 5 star rating.

I have been going to The Spot several times a year when I am in Carpinteria.  Their grilled food just hits ""the spot.""  I enjoy their grilled cheesebugers with crispy lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickes, and sauce.  It is a simple stick to your ribs burger that doesn't cost much more than a fast food joint that serves up microwaved hamburgers.  Their fries, onion rings, and chili-cheese fries are also good.

On my recent trip I tried their sausage breakfast burrito and this was probably the best breakfast burrito I have ever had.  Fresh grilled potatoes, fluffy eggs, sausage - wow.

I tried their clam chowder because this is what we do when we travel to coastal communities.  I was disappointed because if I order clam chowder in a bread bowl, there is a certain expectation for taste.  The chowder obviously came from a can.  It had the canned taste, potaties were too uniform, and the clams were dark like they were processed.  - fishy after taste.  

Despite the clam chowder I will likely be back after I have worked up an appetite swimming and crave Americana Dive food that is well done.  The atmosphere like I said fits this place so as a total beach dive experience, it is as good as it gets.  I recommend sticking  to the grilled food to get the best out of your visit."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The location is awesome, but the food is mediocre.  If you are staying in Carpinteria, it is a convenient walk to the beach but you can do better if you are willing to drive.  Padaro beach grill is much better if you are looking for burgers and go to Beach liquor or Reynaldo's if you want breakfast burritos."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"We went there for breakfast, the coffee was really good and the food was great. Had a huge Bagel sandwich with eggs and bacon along with hash browns that were perfect. This is the perfect little beach cafe. My daughter had fish tacos which also looked delicious and a large portion.   This place was very reasonable, cute and the staff was so friendly."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"This beach dive little place in right near the beach definitely a great place to stop after a motorcycle ride. There food is decent. Had there grilled chicken sandwhich. The chicken was great but a little to much sauce it made the bun all saggy. There fries are really good the perfect crunch and soft, they have a good combination. Onion rings make sure you ask to have them cooked a little longer because they just taste soggy. If you want Icecream or a shake I definitely have to say a hell yes. Chocolate taste is smooth almost like a whipped yogurt. The one thing I will say is they have the smallest restroom facility, if someone is suppose to fit in there I do not know how. Water is leaking all in there from the toilet to the floor and you feel like your in there kitchen because you can hear everything, Kinda gross if you think about it. They do really well for business I think they should upgrade there restroom already. Sanitary wise it's kinda gross."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"What a great little spot, lol.  A perfect right off the road pit stop.  They have a very extensive menu from mexican to burgers.  A young staff takes the order but older more experienced folks actually cook the food.  We had the burger, fries and onion rings.  The food came out after a normal wait and was tasty but not too greasy and I didn't leave the table with the usual I ate way too much greasy food feeling.  I will definitely return here next time I drive from SD to Santa Barbara."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The Hamburgers are OKAY, nothing so special about the spot just that's it's close to the beach. The employees are rude, they screamed the order at me like if they were anoyyed or hated their job. I was at the pick up window because I needed straws I got no help, meanwhile they were all stading in a group by the cash register."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The burgers are just decent, fish and chips are a travesty (frozen, pre-made pieces of fish/grease sponges), onion rigs had a pool of oil in the paper boad; nothing really stands out. Not sure why there's usually a huge line for mediocre food?"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,Great location but sadly average food. Not impressed by their clam chowder; tasted like it came from a can. Nothing to scream about their burgers or fries...charbroiled preferred n maybe seasoned fries would spice up their menu..
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The burgers were good but I definitely don't think it lived up to the rating of 4 stars.

The burgers were average size and had fresh veggies inside which was a plus.  However, the serving of chili cheese fries was pathetic and not very tasty.  The fries were mushy and the cooks were pretty stingy with the chili and cheese.  The staff were helpful but indifferent and not very engaging.  They had two seating areas, one inside and one outside.  Both are pretty well kept and I saw someone walking around and wiping down the tables and chairs every 10 minutes or so.

Overall, I would have rated 3 stars if it weren't for the fact that this place is EXPENSIVE.  For a double cheeseburger, regular cheeseburger, order of chili cheese fries, a large Dr. Pepper, and a small diet coke I paid $17.  

If you are looking for a quick bite to eat and you don't mind paying a bit extra for mediocre food, then this is ""The Spot"".  But if you want more bang for your buck, I'd advise going to another burger joint."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Its been the same since the 60's! People grow up here and its the town classic. Sure, they may have built a macdonals right off the freeway, but all the locals know to just drive a bit extra to get to the spot! :)"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Good Burgers! Chili was basic canned chili. 
Hubby liked the Tacos. 
Onion rings were a disappointment from pics I saw in here. They were not that appetizing. 
Good Quick meal though and nice people."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Good burgers and was a perfect stop for burgers before or after our beach excursions, good amount t of food and good quality. It is cash only. Fries are crispy and they have a selection of many things duch as burritos and tacos and fish and chips as well."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Exactly what you'd expect, so, perfect for what it is. The perfect ""Spot""! Reading some of the other reviews, I can tell you my shakes have never been premade. It's a burger place. They have a lot of other stuff on the menu, but really, look at the context. It's an outdoor burger shack, about 10 x 8 feet with three people hustling around inside making food. Set your expectations accordingly. It's my favorite place to buy an inexpensive burger or chili fries in town. If you want a really excellent burger for 5 times the price, go to Zookers. Opposite end of the restaurant spectrum."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"About 2 blocks from the beach this place has some burgers that are hard to beat!  It's cash only and usually has quite a line of customers waiting, but if you have the time it's well worth it.  They also serve Mexican fare and fish and chowder.  From what I've heard, all good as well!  And plenty of patio seating if you want to bring your furry friends."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"We ate at The Spot yesterday and I'm thinking of going back tomorrow - they're ridiculously yummy! They toast their buns and their chili reminds me of Tommy's -- I'm a fan! They do charge $.50 for soda refills though, hence the 4 stars instead of 5."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I got a regular hamburger and a vanilla milkshake from here and it was delicious! The hamburger reminded me a lot of In-n-Out. I wish it would have been bigger but the sauce was very tasty and the meat was juicy. The ingredients were fresh and hot off the grill. The shake was definitely the best milkshake I've ever had. It was very creamy and thick, not watery at all. If you think In-n-Out shakes are good, you have to try The Spot's milkshakes!!!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,The food is pretty good. It is a good quick stop local touristy place to get food and bring it to the beach for a picnic. Lots of parking.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The way I remember it, The Spot was famous for Enchiladas before their rise to Burger fame. On a recent visit I had plans to relive the past with an Enchilada; but it is not even on the menu. The backup was an Asada Chimichonga; the presentation was very well done, but too many of the small Asada cubes contained gristle; marring the overall great taste. A double cheeseburger was also purchased; again, great taste but the bun did not last long at containing the insides; fortunately, they have forks. The chocolate Shakes and Malts are still some of the best.

Besides the desirable food, another reason we should continue returning to The Spot is to visit a part of history; that is left. In the 1950s and early 60s my family spent their summer vacations camping at the State Beach. During those happy times the Southern Pacific Railroad Station was just across the tracks from The Spot. The lemon packing sheds were a little east down the tracks from the Station. What a great smell; and there was a continuous supply of lemonade for us when we kids visited the packers. Across the street from The Spot on what is now the Tomol Interpretive Play Area was erected the seasonal Bingo Game. At the beach end of Linden Avenue on the same side as The Spot was the Beach Store. Out of all of these places, The Spot is the only one remaining. Maybe our patronage of the Spot will keep this bit of history in tact; and let the workers in that small building know we appreciate them."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Amazing burgers in this sleepy town outside of Santa Barbara!  These might as well be homemade - they certainly don't taste like fast-food.  Our family of four all had the cheeseburgers with bacon added as well as a side of fries, and we all loved the food!  We were there on a Monday afternoon, so business wasn't too busy...we sat outside and watched the world go by as we enjoyed the terrific food.  Definitely reasonably-priced for what you get.  We are here for 4 more days and we will certainly be back!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I love to have a good pastrami anywhere, one my friend told me about this place so I wanted to check it out. What a great place kind a small and kind a crowded but it is ok. 
Anyway I order a pastrami sandwich and strawberry shake it was phenomenon, no complain there, I will be back here before you know it."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"YUM YUM YUM...that about sums it up.  Whenever we go to Carpinteria, which is ALL the time, we always HAVE to visit The Spot.  This burger joint is by far one of my most favorite places to go - yummy, juicy burgers and their onion rings are amazing.

This is a MUST have when you are in Carp."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"So, here's the set up. You've been dorking around in Carpinteria State Beach all morning, working up a good appetite. Pull off the wet suit, dig out the cell phone, call in the order for a double cheeseburger, cheeseburger for the spouse, fries, and a choco shake. (Take note: cash only). Walk from the beach (it's only a block away) to The Spot.

On walk back, you're in your board shorts, flip-flops, eating fries out of the bag. Does it get any better than that? Yes it does. When you plop down at the beach, that kid next to you who's been running around kicking sand, whining and yelling, is now staring at you with a his lame PBJ and carrots.

And oh yeah, good food, I think. But you know how it is when you get out of the water. Everything tastes especially good."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Had lunch on a Saturday. Stood in line for 30 minutes hoping the wait would be worth it...it wasn't. We ordered cheeseburgers, French fries and onion rings. The burgers had no taste and the quality of the meat wasn't that great. The French fries lacked flavor also. They were very potatoey and mushy. Not sure they even salted them. The onion rings tasted like the frozen kind I get at smart n final. I will not be going back. At least now I can say I did eat at Carp's landmark...."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"This is by far my favorite spot lol to eat at when in Carpenteria! Tried the new pastrami dog, 10/10 would recommend!!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"This place only gets a lot of traffic due to its location and ""historical"" value. The food is hit or miss. I have received a nearly raw burger and burned-to-a-crisp chicken tenders and also had pretty decent burgers on other visits. However, it is a beach trip tradition for the tourists and a piece of Carpinteria history. Take it for what it is."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Horrible Food.
Cash Only Purchasing.
Good Location, hence the name.
Poor customer service."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Perfect place to eat with the kids after a day at the beach. Great burgers and fries and the thousand island on the burgers makes it even better. Minus one star for not accepting debit/credit-they have an atm inside the patio, but in this day and age where even the balloon artist at Chili's carries a card reader for tips, this could happen. Minus another star for having a non-working bathroom when I have kids."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"BEST burgers in the whole wide world.  There is a reason for the line, people!!!  Their chili cheese fries aren't anything to write home about, but whatever.  Anytime I am roadtripping along the 101, it is MANDATORY that I stop here for a burger.  I suggest you add it to your ritual list as well :)"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"My family & I have been coming here for years. The Spot is a cute, classic little burger shack within walking distance from the campground & beach. They have awesome burgers & their BLT is really good too! It's cash only, but they have an ATM machine outside right next to where you order. This place is worth a visit when you're in the area!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Totally lives up to the hype. An old fashioned burger stand in the perfect place, in downtown Carp close to the beach and camping. Long lines (20min+\-) on a summer Sat fail to deter most customers for the simple reason the food is old-school wonderful. Good meat for the burgers and fresh ingredients including iceberg lettuce and fresh tomatoes. An extensive menu including tacos and burritos."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"There were 11 of us and everyone liked what they had. Between us we had fried clams - delicious, fried shrimp, burgers, and salads. The onion rings looked huge and yummy."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"We were going to a movie night in town and wanted a cheap bite to eat! 

First impression: cute little order at window spot right next to the ocean! 

Pros: I like the variety of food they have, the prices are inexpensive, delicious fries, decent chile rellano burrito

Cons: cash only, no heaters on their porch"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I've visited The Spot twice since my last review and I'm raving about the freshness of the toppings and the good tasting patties.  Currently one of my favorite traditional burger spots.  The place is a traditional burger joint down by the ocean.  O ya, chili cheese fries, darn good!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Fine, nothing special.  Cute little place with order window. Better burgers at in-n-out."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Deserves much more credit than 3 1/2 stars in my opinion. GREAT double cheeseburger. GOOD chili fries. GREAT prices for on the beach. I'll definitely be back.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The Spot is a horrible excuse for a hamburger joint. Sure, location is convenient, but the food is worse than most fast food restaurants. Cheeseburger is thin, cooked to death and bun is something you can get at the grocery store. Burrito was not great either. My friend who got the burrito said the bottled hot sauce was the best part... Would rather go to The Habit or In-N-Out for a burger, hands down. Did I mention, it's cash only?"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I've been going to THE SPOT for years. I was introduced to it by my step mom when she met my dad. This is a small little shack across from Carpinteria State Beach Campground. 

I've only ever gotten the burger and fries/onion rings but its never been disappointing. My parents love the chili burger, it looked really good. 

The prices are a bit high. 4.50 for a burger 2.50 for a large fry and a large drink is around 2$ and .60 cents for a refill. 

The only down side to this place is its cash only. I hardly remember to carry cash on me. People say it helps keep the cost down. So I guess that's good because it would be even more pricey. 

Dispite all of this we always have to stop by when we are in town and I don't see that changing. If you haven't tried it, it's a must."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The Spot is an iconic burger shack practically on the beach in Carpinteria. Lines can be long for this tourist and local favorite. Enjoy your burger and shake outside and enjoy the weather. The food isn't awe-inspiring, but it is fresh and good. Would recommend for a good, reasonably priced, lunch if you're in the area."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"A burger, fries and a shake will set you back about 10 bucks here, and I can't say that you're getting much better than at In & Out for 5 bucks.  Maybe the shake is a bit better and the burger has a little more meat, but they undercook the burgers to try and disguise the poor quality of the frozen patties.  (well cooked beef, if it's not good quality , gets rubbery and full of grizzle). 
Probably a great place years ago when all they did was burgers and did them well, but the current management has a huge big menu of Mexican food and fried frozen food and this and that, service is slow and everythings just , well,   worth a stop if you're there at the beach with nothing else around and starving...but no longer a place worth pulling off the freeway for."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Cheap, good, fun! Nice local ""spot,"" with great service!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I ate at several different restaurants in Carpinteria, and yes -- THIS was my favorite meal. Treated myself to a fish sandwich with fries and a soda and was SO happy with the flavor and quick turn-around time on service I wanted to tip them again after the meal was over. They are doing everything RIGHT at this joint. Great food for the price and I don't even begrudge the ""cash only"" policy. This will be the first place I come back to when I'm in town again. God Bless The SPOT!!!!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I've been told that Former President Bill Clinton has visited this eatery and was very pleased.

The customer service here is always speedy and pleasant which has probably made the patrons addicted in revisiting this particular spot.

The chili burgers are amazing. I ordered 2 chili burgers with everything on it and the burgers didn't disappoint."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,It's a burger place in a prime location. The burgers are decent the fries less so. Nothing wrong with it.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Ambiance is 5/5, super cute outdoor seating, basically right by a little beach.

Service is 5/5, friendly staff, food came out pretty fast.

Cheeseburger is 3/5.. ""Cheese"" = Kraft slice lol. Next time I'll get the chili burger!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"What a spot.


First time at this spot.
I spotted a table.

The 'burgs were solid. 
Fries were winners. 
I don't really buy into that culture of winning. 
But sometimes, it's clear who is the boss.


The crowd was relaxed. 

Full of people trying to wash off their Saturday nights, in more ways than one. 

Stay strong people. Stay strong."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,I've heard too many people tell me The Spot is the ultimate hamburger experience. Now I know. Don't know what it is but they have figured it out. Got to be one of the top burger stops around.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"At least   one stop @ The Spot (cha-cha-cha)    is a ""must"" on our annual family vacation to Carp,  Yummy burgers at a very handy location just 2 blocks up Linden from the beach. Colorful local flavor adjacent to a very funky beachside neighborhood.  Part of the total experience.  Check out Island Brewing nearby."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,I have been delaying this review sorry I didnt write it any sooner! I make a summer trip on the amtrak to the carpinteria state beach with my family all the way from the San Fernando Valley. I ADORE THIS FREAKING SHACK! I wish we had something like this back home. If you are the kind of person who expects the perfect hamburger or taco or whatnot....this is not the place for you...get on the road and exit to the neareast Mc Donalds. I am a huge in and out burger supporter but the spot tops them...onion rings are amazing...and not too long ago on a trip up to santa barbara I did a pit stop with my husband and got me a shrimp basket to go...I loved it no doubt! If you ever find your self near this beach just order a burger and onion rings they are a lethal combo! can wait for the summer of 2012 they better make room for my order :) they sell shirts there and yes I wear mine...PROUD SUPPORTER of small business!
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I love this place.  We fish and surf and around lunch time we take break and get a burger.  The burgers are awesome and the fries are fairly good too.  I crave these burgers all the time, they are just too far for me to travel.  Every time I'm in Carpenteria, I stop here and get a delicious burger."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Thought i'd check out a new place in Carp. Saw the Yelp reviews and wanted to try it out. I got a bacon cheeseburger and some onion rings. The cheeseburger was edible but barely, the bacon was chewy and not crispy (nasty). The cheese was not melted at all they just threw a slice on it. Onions were okay but not great. Will not return."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"A very typical burger shack

on the tap
chocolate milkshake-i think there was malt in it but it tasted straight like powder
cheeseburger- the bun was soggy and should have been toasted more
pastrami double cheeseburger-the pastrami was put in the middle of the two patties so it slid out
fresh fries-crispy and good
chili cheese fries-not anything special

refills-.50
side dressing-.60

enough chili in the self serve section to make you very happy! Overall, this place was a solid three stars. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The first time I went to The Spot, I had no expectations.  I was hungry and I was pleasantly surprised.  I've been back a few times since and the food from this tiny place has been consistently good.  I had a milkshake for the first time in years -- I thought I gave 'em up -- and it was delicious.  It tasted real and not chemical-flavored.  It was worth the indulgence. 

I'm so glad I don't live next door to The Spot or I'd have to exercise five hours a day just to work off the calories from all the guilty food that I'd eat.

I like The Spot and, judging from the crowds, I'm not alone."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Nothing special. The portions are small, double burger  does't include the French fries and shrimp  taco was small and dry. It is ok fast food to eat near the beach, but if you have a choice in-n-out is much better"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Tourist Trap! Horrible! My family and I had been driving all day from San Diego to Slo and decided to look for dinner in Carp I read the reviews and it seemed like a good spot for us because of the menu ( we have 2 kids) 
The place is dirty and the people inside are super rude!!! Our food was gross and greasy. I will never eat here again."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Had a cheeseburger and onion rings and my dad had a chili burger. Very good burgers! Also had onion rings which were solid. I will definitely return next time I'm in the area.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The best burger in town. After spending the day drinking and vegging at the beach, this is the place to go to refuel your tank. the burger tasted excellent and had great flavor. Fries were nice and crispy, i dont recall having a soggy fry. the outside patio sets the mood and you can enjoy your meal in the beautiful beach weather. to top it off, just across the street beyond the train tracks, island brewing company. so you can continue drinking after you devoured your meal."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Hangover Mecca. Amazing milkshakes. Local businesses. Great burgers. A Carpinteria institution.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Great beach burger stand. Its kinda like carnival food though, delicious but so terrible for you. The lines were long when we went and the staff could be more friendly. But the service was fast and the food was yum. I got a cheeseburger with onion rings and a chocolate chip malt shake. Definitely a good ""cheat"" meal."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"youre gonna have a long wait, but the burgers are OFF THE HOOK!!!   YUMMMMMM!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Went to the Spot recently during a short vacation.  I really liked it. I got a chilli reano burrito and i really enjoyed it.  Took a bit of a burger and it was tasty. Great place for the kids and after you eat you caqn walk down to the beach.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"This is our current favorite stop when traveling up or down the 101.  My husband and I always stop for a burger, fries/onion rings and share a pineapple milkshake.  There is always a line but it moves pretty fast, cash only, ample parking (usually towing a trailer) and outdoor seating."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Bring a calculator and total your own bill.  

The food is decent, but the reason this place gets one star is because the counter girl intentionally wrote down double the price on several items, ($10 per cheese burger), and over charged me $20.  Nice tip.  $46 seemed like alot for 3 cheeseburgers, one order of fries and a chocolate shake.  When i asked about the $10 dollar cheeseburgers, she said that she got confused.

I guess non locals are taken advantage of at this place and not well liked.
 
I hate dishonest people who try to steal from me.  I guess she thinks i don't have to work for my money as hard as she does.  Total your own bill, and if you get ripped off, call the owner."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Growing up in Carp meant weekly trips to the spot! As an adult its still a must when visiting
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"This is a typical local burger shack with average food. The fare of the dining event was a chili cheese dog, hamburger and french fries. Kudos for putting real cheddar on the chili dog. The dog was nothing remarkable, and I'm sure the chili came out of a can, but combined with ocean breezes, sun and sand, it was all right by me. Average tasting cheeseburger - a little too much veggie as noted by other reviewers - but seriously is it right to complain about having too many veggies? We just pulled off the excess (and felt appropriately guilty for not eating all our veggies). The fries were good with a lightly crisp outside and soft center. I did enjoy the myriad of condiments available such as salsa, jalapenos, pepperoncini, etc. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I'm hitting the beach again, I'll stop by."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I first went to the Spot in the early 70's as a wee lad.  I know the management has changed since, but it has left an impression on me after all of these years.  I take my family up there probably 6-8 times a year. I think they make a great buger, with all of the requisite juicyness and fresh ingredients you will need. Better than In N out in my opinion.  Probably Shake Shack in NYC is the best of all, but The Spot has a sentimental ""Spot"" in this yelper's heart."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The Spot has about the best burgers and fries I've ever had. Maybe it's partly the sea air, but I swear by them. The portions are good and the prices are not too high. I would recommend staying with the standards though. Every time I deviate and try something new, like mexican food, I'm disappointed - there are way better places in Carp for Mexican food. But for burgers and fries . . . I give them a 6 out of 5 stars."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Lovely little shack on the side of the road.

We ordered:
cheeseburger - it was just okay...pretty plain tastes but the beef had a decent saltiness to it.
pastrami double cheeseburger - the pastrami was good.  well done but like the wifey said in her review it just fell apart on the first bite...not constructed too good but when have I ever been ashamed to get a little dirty for the sake of gluttony?  good!
fresh fries-crispy and good
chili cheese fries - chili was sort of a let down...I make chili (for hours with very careful attention to details) very well so most chili is ehh to me.

SERIOUSLY?!
refills-.50
side dressing-.60

Great little road stop but they have a lot to learn."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"A great burger place for when you're strolling down Linden Avenue towards the beach. The food is fresh and the service efficient. Both outdoor and indoor seating.
My family and I always stop here for a double cheeseburger and fries whenever we're in town.
Just remember one important tip; have cash in your pocket because that's all they take. No credit or debit cards are honored.

Cheers!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,The Spot is a classic. Delicious food right by the beach - cannot be beat. Every time we visit Carpinteria we have to visit this place.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Very good burger and FF's.
Nice deck and great people watching. 
Meat and veggies were fresh.
Be prepared for line but it goes fast. 
We will be back"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The Spot is a great place for some classic American food right next to the beach. Ride your bike from Carptineria, stop by if you are on the 101, or make a trip for the sunshine and friendly California enviornment.

Best Menu Item: Chocolate Shake w/Real Ice Cream & Malt. So Good."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"When you're at carpinteria state beach You can't beat the spot. When I'm in Carp I always get a double cheese burger and take it down to the beach. It's a good old fashioned burger that you can't go wrong with. 
The line can get a bit long but once you order the food comes fast!
Gotta say I'd give five stars if they brought the homemade salsa back, I really missed that, it really completed the cheese burger.

Although I've eaten there twice this week!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The Spot! The Spot! The Spot! We want The Spot! That is the chant from my girls every time we are in or near Carp. Love the burgers and steak fries. 

Grab it and head on down to the sand and enjoy! Beware of the seagulls, they love it too!

Cash Only"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"It's just alright. I ordered a chicken burger, and there was nothing special about it. In terms of quality and size, it was similar to a McDonalds Burger. All the Burger consisted of were the buns, chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayonnaise (I think). And it really was just the same cheap buns like in any fast-food place. But it was more expensive here. The place consists of a food stand with tables and chairs outside. It looked like a fast food restaurant, and maybe it was. They had seating both inside and outside. You order the food at the stand, and then pick it up yourself. The wait was regular. Overall, It was just so-so."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"This place is great. One of the best chili cheeseburgers I've had. 

The only downside is that they don't take debit/credit card.

Much better than the Worker Bee Diner down the street."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"One word: YUMMY. This place was a lucky find. The burger I had was the best burger I've had in several years. Very juicy. The fries were very good too. Prices are cheap for all that you get. Worth trying out if you have never been here before. If I lived near The Spot ( which I don't ), I would eat there all the time!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Be sure to bring cash. No credit cards. Best chocolate Banana shakes! Line on the weekends gets lost long. Plan ahead
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"I was getting hungry after a long walk and game of volleyball on carpinteria state beach, so I ambled up the road a block to grab a beachside burger. It was a jumpin joint for sure, probably due to its primo location. This is a stand so service was lackluster but I don't have the same expectations for food trucks and carts as I would for a sit down place. My food was out pretty quickly and was a decent lunch for the price. I think the burger was $3.75 and fries about the same. 

They had a fair amount of outside plastic tables but I wanted to go back to the sand for my meal so I didn't stay. Something that did stand out was the enormous amount of ketchup packets they stuffed into my to-go bag...I counted and the grand total was...18. I guess people here like their tomato sauce!

I'd probably try the spot again, given its convenience and adequate grub."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"My 2 friends and I were looking for a place to get take out and hit the beach. This location was perfect for a quick to-go lunch being steps from the beach. The burgers and shakes were 4/5 for sure, very enjoyable and classic tasting. 

The service/overall experience however was less than mediocre. As a fellow restaurant employee, I usually cut people some slack. The woman running the counter did not look up, say hello, or put her phone down until we were inches from the window. We ordered cheeseburgers, shakes, and a cup of clam chowder. The clam chowder was so thick that it jiggled in the cup and tasted fishy. On our walk back from the beach, we stopped in and gave them our full cup of chowder stating it tasted fishy and was too thick. We ate two bites. 

""It's clam chowder, that's how its supposed to taste"". Yikes. Not sure where you eat clam chowder. 

They painstakingly refunded our $5 without an apology or a considerate remark. 

Overall, food was not good enough to recover sour management or rude service. A smile goes a long way, so does common courtesy."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I use to go here as a little kid and after all these years it still the same SPOT. 
Great burgers packed with flavor. 
Chili has good taste and is a great compliment to the burgers. 
I have never tried the Mexican food but the table next to me did and look very tasty. 
A SPOT WORTH TRYING."

onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I loved this place the food was great. Love the chili cheese fries. A little bit small portions, but otherwise awesome. Me and my Husband randomly stayed in this city, an was recommended to go here. Great memories!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Ok.. cash only establishment!! Has no health grade sign from the county?!  Asked about it and the girl at the register gave a blank look and said I don't know?? And a side of attitude!! What is that? We were going to Esau's or worker bees but it was too busy!! My Burger was ok and my sister ordered a shrimp taco... the tortillas were cold and rubbery!! 

My sisters been here before and she says they used to have a huge flavor selection of ice cream and shakes!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Great juicy mouth watering burgers here.  Perfect location near the beach and near downtown carp.  It has a little bit of a grungy feeling but for a burger joint, it's just fine.  I'd recommend it overall and it's my favorite burger place around."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"With two visits to Carpenteria this is becoming a favorite quiet beach spot for me.  Today I decided to try The Spot, a local beach hamburger joint.  All in all this place exceeded my expectations.  I had a cheeseburger, fries and a root beer - all were tasty.  My only criticism is that there is way too much produce thrown on the burger, but this was easily remedied.  For a nice burger by the beach, I would definitely return."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Clam chowder is thick and creamy. Lots of potatoes and clams. Will fill you up.Not soupy at all! Best clam chowder by the beach!  Beef taquitos are so tasty! guacamole is fresh and chunky! It's a small walk up shack! Very casual! Cash only, ATM inside."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"On our way to Solvang last weekend the little hunger bug bit us as we were driving north passing Oxnard. My boyfriend who used to have a business near The Spot recommended this place and said it was hands down the best burger he has ever had, so of course, we had to go there!

By the time we got to The Spot we were famished! So we both ended up ordering the double cheeseburger with fries and a dr pepper :)

It was so good! The meat was fresh and tender, the condiments were also very fresh and the fun was soft and tasty. It put In N Out to shame. 
The fries were fresh out of the frier, so hot and just perfectly seasoned, wow! Even I ate the whole bag and that is very unlike me!

This place deserves 10 stars."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,I grabbed a cheeseburger here on a late afternoon on a Thursday while driving through the area. It was simple but great. All quality ingredients and served quickly with little fanfare. Great option if you just want a quick bite and enjoy it on the beach.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The Spot is a place for reasonably cheap bites that may be needed after some time spent over at the Island Brewing Company.  I had a relleno burrito which was alright, but the others in our group who had burgers said that they were pretty good.  They are cash only, so that can be an issue for some and the not great but passable nature of the food, makes me feel like I don't need to seek out the Spot again."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"This place is the perfect little burger shack next to the beach! The food is fresh and definitely well portioned! Ordered a chimichanga expecting a small plate but wow!! I wish I had taken a picture! The burgers and fries are great, one of my friends said it reminded them of In-N-Out, which being an avid In-N-Out lover, take that as the hugest compliment to their food! The only negative is that you have to pay for a little tub of ranch or bbq sauce if you want it. And they charge for refills too."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Burgers and food are fine for those walking in the area.
Consistently rude and indifferent service.
What they have going for them is an excellent location to the beach and to downtown Carpinteria."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Mmmm mmmm good. Big burgers, DELICIOUS o-rings that tasted like onion rings and NOT dirty over used oil. Fries too are very tasty. Cool location by the beach and across from a huge park. Shopping, other eateries and curios within walking distance. Great place to ppl watch and vist before or after a day at the shore. Large menu with plenty to try.  Looking forward to more visits to The Spot. Chili dog, corn dog & chicken strips are also deeelicioso!
This is one local who will be back again & again!
Tip: don't go holiday weekends...:P
Amtrak is just a skip away too!"

ORDER THE BANANA MILK SHAKE!!! (If this review would be just for the milkshake it'd get 5 stars)

This is a little shack about a block or two from the beach in Carpinteria. We stop by here every time we are visiting Santa Barbara. The ONLY thing worth ordering here is the BANANA MILK SHAKE...I mean they do have a full menu of hamburgers, and mexican food. The food is okay nothing amazing or life changing but every sip of the milkshake is an experience. Now your thinking really, that amazing for a banana milkshake? She can'st stop talking about it...well let me tell you...this Banana Milkshake is creamy with chunks of real bananas. It doesn't have that artificial banana flavoring! It also thick and oh so wonderful...its always a great delight!!! There are other flavors that you can order but I personally adore the BANANA MILKSHAKE!!! YUMMMM"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"We have been eating here for at least 25 years and always loved it. So we didn't mind waiting in line. Not sure if they have changed owners since we've moved away or what. But it was a huge disappointment. My daughters fish taco was cold. My taquitos were hard inside and the guacamole brownish, like it was 3 days old. We also got onion rings that were so hard you couldn't bite them and we were still waiting for our fries. When we took back the hard onion rings, they told us their fryer was broken and refunded fries and onion rings. Later we both had the worst stomach ache... maybe from what we ate? Won't be back. THE SPOT IS NO LONGER OUR SPOT!!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"For its purpose and history I will give the spot 5 stars.
Burger is very tasty and the milk shake must go with banana and chocolate."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Pretty good little burger spot right on linden ! The chicken strips are my favorite and the fries are good too.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"My husband has been wanting to try this place forever. I've always talked him into something else b/c I was afraid this was just a greasy pit.  Turns out it was everything I expected!  If you're in the mood for grease, this is the place for you!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The best lettuce wrapped burgers and grilled chicken wraps, my favorite is a burger or chicken lettuce wrapped with bacon cheese guacamole and their house Thousand Island, off-the-charts good!!!!!! YUM-YUM!!!!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Below average burgers when compared to The Habit, In and Out or even McDonald's original 15 cent hamburger.

It is close to the beach and it is near Island Brewing, but the food is lackluster."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"I stopped by Carpinteria on my way back to Los Angeles. This place had some nice write-ups, and is pushing 95+ years old. Thought I'd try a chili cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate-banana milkshake.

The burger was OK. The chili wasn't the best I've had, but was flavorful and warm on this cool winter day. The fries were crisp and the milkshake was passable. At $12+ the meal was a tad expensive the food quality, but I am glad I stopped by anyway as I like to check out local restaurants with fun history.

This place only accepts CASH - so be aware. Also, refills on sodas will costs you another half buck. I'm guessing that this place would be hopping in the summer months, so plan your time accordingly.

Again, not the best I've had, but I'd stop by again if I were in the neighborhood."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Went with 10 friends after a fun day at Carpinteria beach this last Sunday on Labor Day weekend before 6pm. The food number system came out jumbled, so I waited a few minutes with a friend for her order. I ordered a chocolate shake and fish and chips and my husband had a cheeseburger with guacamole. We LOVED the food. Right after I took a sip of my $4+ shake I thought it was strange that it was watery. I ate the rest of my food with a few sips and thought that was they were.  So we are sitting there and everyone in group was talking about their food- no complaints. I raved about the fish and chips. I asked if anyone got a shake and how theirs were. Everyone said great and thick. (One got a vanilla and another a strawberry) they were serving shakes galore.  Once in a blue moon you may get a dud. Well I went to the window and asked for a new one since it was watery.  The girl shook it and asked the girl making them. She took it out and saw my number and said it was because I let it sit there and gave me a look that would kill.  I said no it was like that from the get go.  She said fine but it will take awhile since backed up on shakes.  You would think customer service wise you would bump it up. But nope I waited for the girl making shakes to make about 8 in front of me. I was scared to leave for thinking they may do something to my drink. Then she walked up to window and literally SLAMMED my shake on counter and turned around abruptly. No here you are, sorry for the wait, or for the first shake done wrong. Two girls in light green spot shirts were so rude. The girl taking orders was very nice. Then to top it off we live an hour away and that new shake was thick almost the whole way home...."

onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Good eats. Julia Childs love their burgers and rightly so.
All points hit and menu prices are vintage too."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Yum! We stopped here b/c of the reviews and were so glad we did. I love 5 star ratings at a $ price. Can't beat that combo. Best of both worlds :) it's walking distance from the beach. There's an ATM, indoor and outdoor seating. Casual attire."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Pretty good burger but not epic as you would believe with the previous reviews. What does make this place special is that the portions are substantial, and the location, which is on the end of linden, approaching the beach.

It was quite a pleasure to eat a good burger with the sea air, almost reminiscent of a beach side burger shack."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Great burger and fun location for people and waitress watching. Burgers are drippy but tasty.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I had a chili dog.  It was OK, but a little salty.  For one, it did not have cheddar cheese or sour cream.  It came with a small fresh cup of onions.  The chili needed some work.  Not much deep chili taste.  The french fries were very good.

 Also tried a hamburger.  Very fresh stuff on the hamburger.  The hamburger was a better choice than the chili dog.  Tasty.  I would go back again."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Still my favorite ""dive"" in town! Their food is consistent and exactly what you would expect from a tiny free-standing shack a few yards from the beach!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I stop at The Spot every time I travel to Ventura. It's a classic cheeseburger with pickles, lettuce, grilled onion (special request) and thousand Island. A solid burger, but what takes the cake here is the chili cheese fries. Also the fact that just next door they brew up some of the most solid beer in the state Island Brewing Company. It's short hop to Surfers Point where I'll have had my 30 minutes to digest prior to plunging into the sea. Hit The Spot next time you travel The 101 through Santa Barbara. Cash only my friends."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"I'm giving this 3 stars because while it's tourist trap with long waits and takes only cash (which I HATE!), it has a huge parking lot. That alone merits 3 stars. The ATM works and charges you 2 bucks in addition to whatever your bank charges so I probably spent 4 bucks to get 40. 

I had chicken tacos (soft) and they were just fine. Two for 7 was a lot for what it was I thought. On Milpas, they would have been better for that much. Or been less expensive and equally good. 

The fries, onion rings and burgers looked fine but I didn't try them. 

The pineapple shake, 4.50, was soooo good though. I haven't ordered a milkshake so long I can't remember Oh, yes! Scottsdale. The Amaretto milkshake at LAMP. So just under two years. 

This is just vanilla ice cream with a pineapple topping (it's a big plastic tub of crushed pineapple, but I don't know if it's sweetened on top of that). 

Heavenly. 

I must not get in the habit of one of these shakes post-swim, though cheap ice cream always has lower fat and calories than gourmet stuff. And I'm sure this is very basic vanilla ice cream, so closer in nutritional content to low-fat yogurt than high-fat specialty ice cream like McConnell's. 

The lifeguard thinks this is overrated and recommended Reynaldo's (sp?) for breakfast burritos. He's very fond of that place."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Family run since 1948.  They custom made me a veggie buritto:  Guac, beans, rice, salsa, grilled peppers, hold the cheese and sour cream.  Very nice, clean, fresh taste.  $5.50.

Wish I wasn't just visiting from out of town."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Cool place.  Who doesn't love going to a shack for burgers??? Right?
Burgers are ok/good - but, way - way over priced.  4 burgers - 4 drinks (2 sodas and 2 floats) and no fry's....  $35!   For me, I think that's a little much.  However, I love adventure and the vibe is so beachy cool, so you may need to check it for yourself."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Harkening back to the 1960's when this type of restaurant was the definition of ""fast casual"", The Spot caught our attention when we were cruising around Linden Avenue on New Year's Eve during the day.  Eating burgers and drinking shakes while sitting outside to eat is a sunny SoCal day tradition, right?

Parking nearby was free, and we snagged a close place.  A healthy-sized line had gathered in front of the order window, but moved quickly.  The young people who were working that day had reasonably good attitudes.

Fast is a relative concept.  Took a while to get our food.  We had to wait for a group to leave to snag a table on their deck out to the side.
I enjoyed my burger, and the chocolate chip banana shake was pretty amazing.  The fries were only so-so, which was a let down.

Also, the staff was not keeping the tables clean.  They were busy in the kitchen, but must have been short staffed to not also be taking care of the space where people sit to eat. 

Cash only is their rule here, so be prepared.  The prices seemed fair, but overall it was only an okay experience.  I'll spare you a comment including their name.  ;-)"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Everytime I'm in Carpinteria, I have to visit the Spot.  I love their hamburgers, special quesidias (pastrami), and their nachos.  They are on a cash only basis."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Their burgers and fries are a ""feel good"" spot for my tummy.  We came here as a pit stop but I loved their lunch tables in front and I even saw wood picnic tables and wild flowers in back--nice touch!  Good ""sleepy town"" joint.  We will definitely be back when we go on the road again!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Great lunch place for a sand-covered family like mine headed home from the beach! We had a burger, chili in a bread bowl (so much food!), and shrimp and chips. All great. My toddler son LOVED watching the train go by right in front of him. Will come back next time we are in town."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Love their chili dog. Stop to have one everytime I am in the neighborhood. I have even driven here from Thousand Oaks, just to walk on the beach and eat.

All meatcChili made from scratch daily. You must try."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"These guys do great burgers, perfect for a spot of lunch after sitting on the sunny beach for the morning. They have other things too but their burger is great, loaded with the usual trimmings and a great burger sauce. I think the only downside is that there isn't much of a selection with the burger."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,We went late January and food was as good as always. My only complaint is that the only cheese option is American. Blech. Always packed. Always delicious! Grab some food and then walk along the beach just 50 feet ahead.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Killer burgers and fish tacos take them to go to island brewery across the street and have a beer. Walking distance from the state beach campground.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"This place is rad. :)
Clearly a little mom and pop shop, you can feel good supporting a small local business.
Unpretentious and walking distance from the beach, the place has a cute outdoor deck to eat at after you order at the counter. Great fries, good burgers, dog friendly, next time I need a shake!"

onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,delicious hamburgers and shakes less than a block from the ocean. Cash only!!!  Sometimes the line can be long but I have been coming for years and never wait longer than 15 minutes. They have a decent seating area but if you walk right across the street there is a lovely park with lots of grass seating and lovely trees providing shade and ocean views. Yummy burgers that hit THE SPOT :)
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"good burger.
good location.
long lines in the summer.
if you're in carpinteria give it a try"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"This little spot puts any fast food place to shame and is so worth all the calories and any wait. I had a chili Cheeseburger with onion rings and a chocolate milkshake. Everything was incredible and delicious. I loved that the burger had pickles and mustard on it.

I saw that people complained about a wait and it being cash only. Just come prepared and be smart about what time you go. Lunch or dinner time on the weekend during the summer time is going to be crazy! During the week or off hours is the best idea. I went on a Monday at 3 and there was no line and I got my food in less than 10 minutes. There is also ample seating to enjoy your meal."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"If you are looking for a McDonalds done up in a beach shack motif then this is your place. Classic 1/4 inch thick gray and tasteless slab of what may be meat brought to life by a tomato slice, loads of lettuce and a sweet sauce, served on a soft bun. Yuk! Try Roge Tacos up the street for a fun and tasty cheap lunch but then cross to the other side of the street en route to the beach"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"After 20 years of beaching it at Carpinteria, we FINALLY stopped at THE SPOT!  After the crush of the Avocado Festival on Linden Street (where we downed a lemonade and an avocado shrimp cocktail), we decided to walk down to the beach since the weather was so glorious.

Passing The Spot I suggested, since the line wasn't long and we had never in all the years we've been going to Carpinteria stopped there to eat, that we give it a try.

TLOML had a chili dog which he said was small and needed tomato slices to cut the chili, but good.  I noted the price was actually quite reasonable for the dog.  I got a chili burger (no cheese, no pickle) and was quite pleased with the chili, the onion and the tomato.  The bun was nicely toasted, so the crunch of the bun set off the chili and the sweet tomato well.  I think the only problem with food like this is that I have a tendency to snarf it down instead of dine.  It was a five napkin burger and a nice treat.

Why three stars?  Well, it was, as it says, A-OK, but no one came out to wipe the tables the whole time we were waiting for and eating our food.

And it's just not as good as Tommy's."

onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Yummy ice cream and cone! Great strawberry milkshake and fries!! Burgers were pretty good, would prefer more melty cheese! Great spot and great service."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Nothing fancy, just basic food, which is good! It's a burger shack, in a beachside town, near the railroad tracks. We like The Spot for it's onion rings, double cheeseburger (add pickles and jalapenos) and the bread bowl of clam chowder. We usually visit Carpinteria in Nov. so have never waited very long for food. Been coming here 18 years."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Love the spot! My family visits every Summer & looks forward to their burgers. Lines get loooong around lunch hour, so be prepared to wait!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Great Burgers...and the spot...is perfect.  It is just a few meters away from the beach.  With a few steps you can enjoy the delicious burger and watch the waves.

However, the lines are long, especially during lunch."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Went to the Spot with 2 co workers today.... Waited in line after ordering for at least a half hour..... got back to the office with the food and found a completely cold.... like frozen parts cold cheeseburger.... I sat and watched a lady return two burgers before my order came out for being cold.  Hoping I didn't get her scraps.  

Also my guess is they're putting frozen lettuce onto the cheeseburgers causing the disgusting uneven taste/texture that came along with the cold burger.

So all in all a long wait, crap service, and no quality control. I order a cheeseburger, small onion rings and a small soda, $10.00 gave a $2.00 tip. 

NOT WORTH YOUR TIME..."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Best burgers in Carp.  Remember to bring cash!
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Whatever you order you WILL NOT go wrong! ! Everything on the menu is amazing! The location is perfect-right on your way to the beach from downtown! It's a small burger joint and might not look too inviting, but I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Well...the Spot was okay. Nothing special to write home about which was disappointing because every time we come to Carp there is a line down the street. Burger was fine, fish was fine, onion rings were fine, fries were fine. Just fine."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"On family beach days, this place is super convenient (except for the fact that it only takes cash...ugh).  I haven't tried the burger, but the fries were crispy and fresh and the chicken fingers were decent.  It doesn't have much seating, but I've always taken it across the street to picnic in the park on the grass."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Came to see what all the rage was about... and I'm a HUGE burger fanatic! I mean... it really takes A LOT for me NOT TO indulge and fall in love with a burger.... but they literally have NO flavor and taste completely frozen. 
Fries taste like old frozen microwaved fries. 
Presentation looks FANTASTIC... but one bite in and it's like ... ""EH"" 
Even their ranch dressing was sour and weird tasting... and I paid extra for it... never doing that again. 
Sorry. I'm just being honest. I'd rather drive a little farther and go to the Habit."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"I had this dream last year that The Spot was only 30 minutes from my home. I believe it may have been the best dream I have ever had. Alas, it will remain only in the twice yearly Carp trips. Delicious cheeseburgers, even better onion rings, and the milkshakes, incredible. The clam chowder is going to leave you a bit disappointed, but if your the kind of person who orders clam chowder from a burger joint, maybe that's just how things are."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"I have no idea why this place has such great reviews, although I didn't order a shake. Aside from being overpriced for the quality of food that you get, it took them 30 minutes to get me a fairly simple burger. That was also after standing in line for about 20 minutes. I get it, you're busy (somehow), but figure out a way to speed up service or at least make a better burger. If you don't mind driving a bit, go for The Habit, In & Out, or The Brewhouse instead for burgers."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Imagine biting into a juicy hamburger, followed by some fries and a THICK, creamy milkshake, ALL while sitting on a blanket on warm sand with a beautiful view of the ocean horizon. 

Gosh, how can it get any better?! This place is so close to the beach you can just get it to-go and walk on over to the beach or grass."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Excellent burgers. Clean, nothing fancy, cooked to order and flavorful. They keep to a basic burger and don't mess with it, which I like. The fries are crispy and flavorful without being mushy or over salted. I had a strawberry shake and it was wonderful. Smooth and not too sweet.

This stand is next to the beach and there is no way you can beat a delicious burger and shake while watching the waves. It's classical beach burger stand and I look forward to going back there."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The service and the food is always fantastic here. It's a small wait for your food but definitely worth it. My family has a saying that, ""It's not vacation until we eat at The Spot, even if it's our last meal of our trip."" I will drive 2.5 hours each way from North Orange County to have a double cheese burger and fries."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Decent food! The burgers were okay, not amazing! I guess I'm just spoiled by great burgers like Sylvesters in Los Osos and other great places. 

My major disappointment came with the fries; they tasted frozen. I know most places will have frozen fries, but they shouldn't taste like it. 

I know it's a great location and I walk by it almost every day when I go walk my dog, but haven't really thought about it much since I wrote this review."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"This place will always remind me of summers at the beach when I was a kid.  Nothing was better than walking up the street and grabbing a ""Spot Burger"".  This is a Carp classic.  Love this place."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"We've been going to Carpinteria beach for 20 years now and always try to grab a burger here while in town.

Pros: Great cheeseburgers, onion rings and chili dogs.  Fries are meh, but I'm not a fan of fat squishy fries. 

Cons: cash only, extra charge for refills and sides of ranch."

onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"We only stopped for a milkshake and we loved it!  Just a quick check-in here to let folks know you can park, grab a quick shake and walk to the beach and enjoy the view.  We had strawberry banana -- I'm sure I could have ordered 4 more it was so good. Fresh yummy banana chunks all blended in but still was able to get them up the straw!  

Glad to have stopped and enjoyed the shake.  Parking was across the street, 2 hour free, and there was plenty when we came by.  They don't appear to be open later in the evening -- closed at 6:30pm when we came by but check for seasonal hours.  I can't picture they wouldn't want to take advantage of visitors during the summer evening hours. Only star ding was for size of milkshake - could've been a bit larger.

I did see a huge batch of onion rings being made for someone having a late lunch.  I was envious but we had already eaten.  Maybe next time."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,Decent AmeriMex food. The location was right outta Surf City. Worth a hungry beach comber check out.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"There's too much to elaborate on so I will briefly list all the bad......my fries were undercooked. The guacamole had absolutely no flavor. The clam chowder was cold. The chili was not homey. And the ranch was very sub par. 
I suggest only getting a cheeseburger if anything. It was pretty good but I would take a Habit burger over this place any day."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Drove all the way from Simi Valley to try The Spot. It was worth the drive! Another beautiful day in paradise.
Ordered a double cheeseburger, fries, and a chocolate malt. Service was fast and friendly. Prices were average for quality burger. The burger was piled high with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onion. Dressing was tasty and not over powering. Nice soft bun and put together so as not to come all apart as it was consumed. My pet peeve is ""poor assembly"" of burgers, mine was well put together. Fries were adequate, not spectacular. Malt was old fashioned, malt shop reminiscent and delicious. These are worth sharing. Love the ambiance of places like The Spot. All in all 4 Stars!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Once I moved to Carpinteria I learned very quickly how important The Spot is to people all over Santa Barbara. I honestly don't get it. It is a burger stand. A little snack shack near the beach. The food isn't special in any way. I feel like it wouldn't be difficult for the owners to do one dish using local ingredients to really make it special. Why would they though? The line is almost always 5 deep in the summer and people are mesmerized by it. Again, I don't get it."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Like a East Coast September afternoon, this little ""spot"" serves up memories of a forgotten time.  The paint is peeling, the floor is sandy, and the food is delicious.  It's not healthy but really, is that what you were looking for on a Saturday afternoon at the beach?  Live large - order the onion rings."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Stopped by for a quick bite on our way to Santa Ynez (guided by the ""nearby search"" feature on the iphone Yelp app!).  We arrived at what looked like a small town burger shack.  The place was pretty packed, so we figured it had to be good.   
After scouring over the menu, we decided on their ""famous"" burgers.  Ordered a cheeseburger w/ bacon, a double cheeseburger and some chili cheese fries.  We were both pleasantly surprised by the juiciness of the patties (had a nice pinkish hue in the middle) and the overall quality of the burgers.  Fries were good, but nothing out of the ordinary (onion rings looked much better).  
Final verdict:  good food, dirt cheap & ninja fast!  would stop by here again!"

onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Food is overrated. It's ""good"" due to it's proximity to the beach.
Rude service and mediocre food
Sorry folks, I just don't get what you did."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Always a yummy burger. My favorite is the Ortega cheeseburger. Live there Banana shake!
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Close to carp beach, and great, filling food after a day at the beach!  Ate nachos, fries and milk shake.  Spicy salsa verde, twas bomb!!!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Definite good beach vibe....left my flip flops on the beach and joined my kids for fresh full of lettuce hamburger. Good fries too. Only comment I don't go for secret sauce which it came with...
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The spot is nothing special but will satisfy your craving for a burger and fries.  On the positive side the burger is alright and the benches behind the spot are a good place to relax and catch your breath.  I have often found myself back there with a coke looking at the mountains and contemplating my existence.  Am i doing all i can with my life? Should I be trying to help the environment or save victims of sex slave trafficking? 

Staff will usually get your order wrong and put a thousand island dressing on despite me requesting it be removed.  Seriously that crap does not belong on a burger.  Fries have an odd peanut flavored taste though I could see how folks might be into that.

3.1/5 stars.  My brother says try a banana milkshake and I hate bananas"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"All that I can say is, ""Yummy, yum, yum!""  The Spot has killer burgers, yummy fish tacos, delectable chili cheese fries and just about any other appetizing comfort foods that you can imagine.  They have great prices too!  It is a cool place, located right near the beach...bring your pooch and grab a seat outside in the sun:-)"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Always a good place to eat at when visiting.

Be aware, sometimes there's a wait there."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The spot serves the very best hamburgers on the planet... Everything is SPOT on, and has been the same since the 80s (probably earlier, but I wasn't alive before then...)-- You don't mess with perfection!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"My fiance and I went for lunch. We ordered chili cheese fries and chicken strips. Now we usually do not eat these types of foods because  I  cook at home, but we wanted to try this place out. There was nothing  special about our food, perhaps we should have ordered something else but our food was okey. Other than this the service was good. The wait for the food was reasonable for the amount  of customers they had and the location is awesome! Good little Spot!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"The spot is a Carpinteria institution worth giving a try!

The burgers are solid, the fries/onion rings are tasty, and the shakes are good!  

This is definitely the place to grab a bite if you are at the beach, staying in the state park or about to jump on a train (REALLY!).

Over the years, the menu has expanded and these ""try to be everything to everyone"" menu items are what drags the ratings for The Spot down.

If you go for the basics you will have a 4/5-Star experience!!!"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Our party had a double cheeseburger, chili cheese burger, and fries.  One thought the chili cheese burger was good enough to do again and one thought the double cheeseburger was dry.  Let me say the cheeseburger had fresh pickles, lettuce, and tomato, but the meat just wasn't juicy and the cheese was probably american (I do like cheddar).  Love the location, across from a park near the ocean, a local hangout as well as a tourist spot, now I understand the name The Spot."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Bachelorette party gone wild

Beer, tequila shots, and champagne overflowing (safety first, we hired a shuttle to drive us around - this thing had a karaoke machine and was stacked with libations)

4 am Bedtime

8 am HANG OVER 

9:30 am Purging of the alcohol by various methods (2 bathrooms in the house for 11 girls)

11:30 am Ravenous ----- Bacon cheeseburgers, fries, onion rings for hungry and hung over girls.  

Perfect sunny day, awesome company, and foodies that were a cure for the nite's excess!  You can't go wrong."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Stopped here with a friend for a quick lunch in March 2012. Service was good, it was a weekday so the wait wasnt too long. My friend ordered a burger and fries and I had the carne asada burrito. 
Her burger was acceptable - served hot, but nothing special, just standard decent run of the mill burger on a rin of the mill bun. Same with the fries - they were good but nothing remarkable. My burrito was tasty, maybe had a little more beans and rice in  than meat for the $7 price, but it was served hot - and was tasty and filling. You're probably not going to be wowed by any of the cuisine - its all standard burger hut fare, but sitting nearly ocean side while enjoying a meal on the patio is really what youre there for, right? And its not bad...."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Yup, its that good. 
The shakes (I had chocolate chip, b/f had chocolate) are the perfect consistency for fry-dipping. Which, I'm my opinion is a huge factor in how much I like a place. 
The burger itself was killer. The bun was toasted to perfection, the bacon was wiggly, it was crisp and tasty. The fries are so-so; I'm pretty sure they come out of a bag, but I cover them in milkshake, so who am I to complain? 
The location makes it an awesome place to hang out and enjoy a GREAT burger."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Wow, the spot is truly a great name. This beautiful stand on the beach is always home to families and hungry beach goers. 

The menu ranges from tacos to pastrami burgers (both are excellent). The pastrami is always perfectly caramelized and served hot. The garden burger is also one of my favorite items on the menu.

Both indoor and outdoor seating available."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The chocolate milkshakes here hit the spot, as do the fries. It is also quite close to the worlds safest beach, you just can't lose."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Avoid at all costs.  $4 cheeseburger, $2 small fries.  Burger was small, fried, tasteless.  Ordered no onion but came with onion.  Think $1 burger for 400% too much. Fries were nothing special, small serving and not hot.   Friend ordered a burrito and they got it wrong too.  Another friend order the burger with no sauce.  Sauce all over it.  Maybe the order taker and fry cook don't understand English.  Won't be back.  Literally, the Micky D's $1 double cheeseburger is better.  Slow service and it wasn't crowded...only one order before us.  Parking lot is dirt which is ok but at night, no lights so you stumble back to your car."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Went here with a co-worker for a ""Friday Burger"" lunch.  We usually go to Padaro Beach Grill, but didn't want to drive there from Carpinteria, so we went to The Spot. 

Overall, it is a great place with reasonable prices.  The tables were clean, the service friendly, and the food decent. 

My only criticism is that the tomato and lettuce on my cheeseburger was so cold, it seriously detracted from the ""burger experience.""  This is a big fault as the guy/gal who made the burger should have done something about it prior to assembly.  

On the plus side, the chocolate shake was awesome and the burger bun was really, really good. 

Pros: 
1) Location 
2) Awesome Shakes! 
3) Menu variety (more than just burgers)
4) Parking is abundant 
5) Burger bun is yummy

Cons:
1) Poor temperature control of food
2) Can be really, really crowded
3) Service can be slow

I will go back, but they have a few things to work on.  Until I get a burger of good temperature, I'll hold back the 5th star."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Aw, man... I don't like giving cute hole in the wall places a low review, because I tend to think that food at these kind of places are so much more fun.  However, the stomach ache that this food left me with won't allow me to stretch the truth.

The onion rings looked and tasted delicious, but the chicken tenders were dry and stiff.  I could barely stomach it.  The french fries were really good, and helped me get through the meal.  You have to pay $.60 for Ranch/BBQ sauce and I thought that was a little much.

I won't be back, unfortunately, but the ambience of sitting outside was pleasant. A lot of people seem to love this place, as shown by the very long lines down the road."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"We looked into this place before visiting Carpinteria and wanted to stop by at the Spot and get some food from this place and take it to the Island Brewing Company close by.

While we were walking on Linden Ave., we started talking with a nice local gentleman who also recommended The Spot as ""they have the best burgers in town"". This place has been around for a long time, so that's nice, to support a local business, a Carpinteria institution.

The Spot is a small local fast-food joint, very close to the beach that stays open till 8 pm on Saturdays, which is great for Carpinteria where restaurants close earlier.
Since we stopped by at the end of May, it wasn't a long line. The service was good and fast. It's not super fast, but they need time to make the food, right?

We ordered 2 cheeseburgers  to go and they were very good, not outstanding (had better burgers before), but this isn't a gourmet place. It's just a small joint off the beach and the food is decent. We also shared a large portion of nachos (with cheese, refried beans, sour cream, fresh guacamole and chopped tomatoes) which was also good, the ingredients were fresh.  

They have a decent inside area if want to eat there and also an outdoor one, nice and simple. No frills, just fun, off the beach. Cash only. Decent prices, dinner menu and some mexicans dishes as well.

Don't expect to have the best meal ever at The Spot, but  just something fun and casual."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Not a bad little place to stop at if you want a quick bite. 

We were staying at Carp State Beach across the street and just wanted to explore around a bit. Kids took a nice bike ride while we walked to The Spot. 

We split a cheeseburger (pretty conventional but not bad!) while the kids had a hot dog and a corn dog (batter perfectly cooked).

Not the healthiest place to eat, but it was quick, inexpensive, and pretty tasty."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"I find the food to be below average in taste (especially the grilled chicken sandwich!), and the wait is long both in line and to receive the food. Also, they charge extra for ranch :/

...The only reason to go here is the convenience to the beach and Island Brew Co."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"I have come to this burger joint for many years. I used to think of it as the perfect combination of burgers and beach. I was dismayed on my last visit. It was clear that the quality of the food had declined. I burped my burger all day. The onion rings were made from the tough outer rings. They were mostly inedible. I did not approach the server over the less than adequate fare because I had been dismissively treated during the order process. I couldn't imagine I would be well received. There are two other issues that are bothering me. 1. The front order window looks really messy and as if it hasn't been tended to in years. There is a difference between funky charm and just plain funk. 2. There was an order from the city to cease renovations on the indoor seating area until permits had been pulled. There was a guy working in there anyway. Not really a wise decision in earthquake prone California, nor legal. I really do wonder how much The Spot cares about it's patrons anymore."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Perfect beachside burger shack...awesome griddled burgers with thousand island dressing, chili cheese fries, and shakes...usually a long line during peak hours but they are fast and efficient. Prices are reasonable ...$4 plus for most items. There is a reason they have been here for decades."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Great. burgers, great location near the beach, we love this place.  So what if the bathrooms aren't perfect people?  Lol.  You're in a tiny beach town at a small burger stand.  And for the ones who complain its cash only, it's not the only place in Carpinteria that's cash only..  We just went and got cash.  We thought it was part of the charm.  We love Carpinteria and will go to The Spot every time we're here."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Everything's pretty good. Only complain I have is they should have purple onions in their burgers rather than white
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Step aside ""In and Out""! The ""SPOT's"" burger and fries are much tastier! Always has a line, but from order to take out  with in 10 minutes."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Super grumpy staff and overpriced mediocre food. And, cash only with an overpriced ATM. Nice view but I'd keep biking into town for better food."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,Good if you're hungry from playing on the beach and happen to have cash in somewhere in your shorts.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"Oh I've never mentioned how much i love this place? Well i love it! I gave up fast food years ago but there are a couple places ill occasionally make exceptions for and this was one of them. During my brief stint in Carp this Spot was my everything. Their menu is HUGE: burgers, mexican, fish & chips, i have yet to try out all my faves. 

Love to get their corn dogs! Classic & delicious. Amazed at how hard it is to find them here. Their burgers hit the spot just riiiiight when u need a fast food burger thats not gonna make your stomach flip an hour later. Personally i enjoy theirs better than The Habit. Fries are pretty good as well, they've always been fresh, even if a bit basic.

Service has always been good if not overly friendly. Drag that it's cash only. But just come prepared theres definitely going to be something on this menu you'll want. Thank me later."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,negative,"Good burgers, often a long line since it's right by the beach. They only take cash which can be a pain but if you are looking for simple beach food this is the perfect place! I LOVE the clam chowder, so creamy and comes in a yummy bread bowl. Worth the visit :)"
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,One of my favorite Burger joints. Chili Cheese Burger is delicious. Fries are great. They have a ATM Machine because is a Cash Only place.  Great customer and its next to the beach. Parking lot is behind the Restaurant. It's a must try.

onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,"The line was long, but worth it!  Great burger, great onion rings, great service.  We ordered to-go and walk across the street to Island Brewing and enjoyed our burgers with some good beer.
I ordered the bacon cheese burger.  I also ordered my onion rings well-done and they were perfectly caramelized inside and crispy outside."
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Great old time hamburger spot hence the name plenty of parking seating is limited but adequate dogs are welcome & only steps from one of the nicest beaches around. I've only had the double cheese burger which was outstanding.
onLwomlGswMhhmOEAeAVEg,The Spot,Mexican,positive,Spent a wonderful day in carp and once again ate at The Spot.  Perfect for a burger and fries.  Bring cash they dont take cards.

You won't regret"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Get the Agave burrito
Get any burrito
Get their nachos

Their service is next to perfect
Will come again whenever I'm in the area
Also fresh to order tortilla chips

PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Best place to go for Mexican in the SB area. Right by UCSB with great parking. The food is amazing and reasonably priced for the fact that you'll definitely be full.

Great seating inside and out as well. Look forward to going again."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Get the horchata!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Food and drinks are fun, varied, and served quickly, regardless of how busy. Pretty loud place as they have 2 stereos on, different music, people had to yell to be heard...and the multiple birds in the restaurant seemed to be welcome (don't leave your chips to get a Coke refill!). Just eat outside and have a drink and some of their yummy food and prepare to walk it off."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Tried couple of different items. All items were great. Ambience is also perfect if weather allows you to sit outside.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Saw Los Agaves recommended on Yelp so we gave it a try.  The location is a storefront in a strip mall and it was packed on a weeknight.  I had the carnita burrito and the plate presentation was superb but the taste was even better.  My wife had chicken tacos that were tasty.  

The salsa bar offers wide selection with most of the selections hotter than advertised!  

Great family place."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Food is delicious but it is way overpriced, they never have enough seats, and the staff is horrible. The manager is not willing to help or accomodate customers."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Sat on the patio on a sunny day last week and have the best beef taquitos I've ever eaten! Shared a Caesar salad and my husband loved the Chile Relleno burrito.  Delicious salsa & crisp tortilla chips, too.  Friendly and helpful staff. Will definitely come here again."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Food still great but they really need to get their registers working. Again, line out the door and they only have one register working and that employee was also taking phone orders.  That tells all the customers who are waiting they don't really care."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This place was good. Nothing seemed outstanding to get 5 stars.  Food was decent, place was packed. Food was cold by the time we got it.  I'd probably try it again."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Recommended by locals: The Molcajetes, and a Burrito. We're coming from LA, and have no expectations -- vacation, enjoy! We were told this as a great place to enjoy Santa Barbara as a tourist, and local for a sit-down. 

Food: 
- Los Burritos: Little brother (local) recommends the Agavas Burrito. We got the Burrito Majado and it was huge!!
- As a tourist, we were recommended and got the Molcajetes (large black lava hot looking stone bowl). Was very entertaining and sizzling hot the whole time. We got it without cheese. It comes with a cactus!! (Nopal). This dish is enormous. The tortilla is fresh. I think this could be shared among 2 people. 
- Get the avocado mild green sauce for your chip dipping pleasure. 

Decent. Can't complain. Outdoor patio and heaters were nice. This place also serves beer. Popular family restaurant, packed compare to the other food joints in the same plaza."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Best flavor, best service, most authentic, best salsa bar, best management and good art on the walls.  Los Agaves has ruined all other Mexican places for me.  Worth it every time, all the time."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"We absolutely loved the food, the people and the ambiance was lively and clean. The food was very authentic and nicely seasoned. Good value for the food. The tacquitos were a hit!!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"It's pricey (about $30 for two people) but it's delicious. 

Get the Agaves Burrito if you can! It's probably the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. 

Parking was a breeze, though you might find it busy on the weekends. It's in a plaza with lots of other shops and a Costco."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Awesome, awesome, awesome...This place is busy but they get you in and out. And the food quality doesn't suffer. They surely could use a bigger spot but I'm sure that's in the plans. They are surely getting the revenue. I'm from the Bay Area but when I'm down south and in Goleta this is my joint!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"The food wasn't bad, but the fact that the design of the place is such that you order and then find a seat makes it a pain to eat at. 
I had dinner with 4 folks and ordered Fajitas. The absolute easiest meal to make and yet I got it 15 minutes after all the other guest.
They are clearly out gunned with there business model. Time to regroup and try again."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I'm a fan of the flautitas and the chimichanga. Also I love the salsa for the chips while you wait for your food. Lunch has been a bit crammed however, I recommend getting there around 11:45."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"A local I met on the plane ride down recommended this place.  It was delicious.  I had a shrimp mango mixed green salad that was scrumptious.  My friend had the chicken salad and loved it too.  Glad we got there around 11:30AM as it was packed by noon.  You order at a counter, and then they bring it to you at your table.  Nice seating inside and outside."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Very very happy that Los Agaves has moved so close to UCSB, but I think that they still need to iron out a few issues before I am ready to give them the high praise that the other locations net. It may be a lack of space, but ordering at the counter doesn't have the same fun as it does at the other locations; the same could be said for the interior, which is nice, but doesn't have the warmth. The food is still top notch :D"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Quality Mexican food and service. Pricey but big portions so you get your money's worth. I usually get a burrito or enchilada to share with a friend. Strong flavors, mouthwatering rice, and oozy cheese all around."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,I like the casual atmosphere inside and outside as well as their fresh salsa bar. The mango margarita with spicy salt rim was refreshing! I ordered the fish tacos and they were so deliciously crunchy and tender in the inside.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Two Words about this place, TACO TUESDAY! $2.50 tacos and $2.50 beers of your choice, is a winning combo for a lazy Tuesday night. For every other day other week there are great and authentic choices on the menu, such as the La Camarones De Diabla and the Molcajete is a great way to split a meal on a date night. All in all I am a huge fan of this place, its great fun for the whole family, just get there early on Tuesdays as it gets packed!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"I use to go to the location on De la vina all the time and loved it, so I was excited when they opened one in Goleta where I live. The food is great as always but the whole place is a mess. The layout has you ordering right where people are eating so there is no space to move and it's awkward. For some reason every time I've gone they get us our food before the chips and salsa, and the amount of seating is a joke. There was nowhere to sit so I got an order to go. I waited 30 minutes for my order. I think I'd rather drive downtown."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Bland, very Americanized Mexican food. No trace of any traditional Mexican spices. Zero heat.
1. Who ever heard of a Mexican restaurant without carnitas? 
2. The sopes were swimming in a copious amount of rather tasteless watery liquid which had overflowed the shell and onto the plate which removed their crispness. Did not resemble sopes very closely.

If this is 4.5 stars, I shudder at the thought of what is perceived as a bad Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara

The two stars are because they let us have the dog under the table on the patio."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I tried Los Agaves one time, the one nearer to downtown SB, and was not a big fan. I didn't like the sweet orange cream dressing on the salad and there was also a sweet sauce on or in  the seafood burrito. I don't remember the details because it was a while ago, but I was not interested in ever going back.

Then Los Agaves opened a new location near my house in Goleta. I decided to give it another shot, and this time I hit something I liked much better! I give it 4 stars, because when I get something I like, I really like it. But there's also a few items on the menu that I do not enjoy because of the sweeter sauces.

Really great salsas and iced tea. This place is always packed, so plan ahead!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This place is amazing!!!! I thought I had had good Mexican food before but this place stepped it up a notch. Slightly pricey but WELL worth it. Amazing flavor, incredibly generous portions and a fantastic salsa bar. We don't live in SB but we come here every time we pass through!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Definitely the best Mexican food restaurant in town. 
My husband and I go often. 
Our favorite dishes are the Chiles Norteños and the enchiladas suizas. 

Enrique, the manager at Los Agaves Goleta, is always very nice."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"So so so good, one of the best places I've been to in SB. Food was great & I got my food within 5 minutes of ordering regardless of the long line. Highly recommend, it won't disappoint"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Fish tacos were killer and they have some of the best salsa in town. I also love their side salad with mango and dried cranberries. The only downside is that the location of the soda and salsa bars make them hard to access on a busy day (it's usually busy) leaving a big awkward traffic jam in the middle of the restaurant.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Great tasting Mexican food. Authentic, good selection and large portions. Would come again."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"A friend recommended Los Agaves and I am super glad we went. This place was super busy. The location is great and the service could need a little work but understandable since it was crowded. They have indoor and outdoor seating and they do have fire set up for chilly weather. We did have difficulty getting them to start the fire! We ordered the Cheese Enchilada de Roja with a side of rice and beans and Quesadillas De la Esquina and both of these dishes were super delicious. The beans came in a little tostada. I thought that was super cute. There is lots and lots of cheese! We also ordered a hibiscus drink which was interesting. 

Our server was nice recommending us vegetarian options and also added a spicy sauce for our enchiladas that I can't remember the name. But, god it was a delicious sauce. The quantity of the food is huge and they definitely have the quality down. They also have other location in Santa Barabara. There is ample of parking in this location since its in an open mall."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Outstanding Mexican food and very good service. Flavors of the dishes are vibrant, fresh and well executed. Burrito Agaves with halibut and shrimp excellent and smothered burrito with steak was delicious. Plenty of chips and salsa for you to enjoy. Highly recommend."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Second time coming here and I'm definitely going to be a regular. Their salsa bar has TONS of variety, though I definitely prefer some over others. Chips are free, service is quick and friendly, and the food is delicious! I definitely recommend the Chiles Norteños.. I've gotten them twice and both times I was very impressed! Only suggestions would be to place an employee who's quicker/more confident at distributing change and to have napkins at every table, or at least a better dispenser up at the front. We had a big pile of napkins on the table since they have to be pulled out on at a time like tissues!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I went here with 3 coworkers for lunch the other day and we ordered a number of different item. I had the Burrito Mojado, another got a Squash Empanada, and another the Agaves Burrito. All were EXCELLENT! Yes, this is not a place to go if you are in a rush, it is very popular and at lunch you might have to wait a few minutes to order and then get your food. In the meantime they give you chips and have an AMAZING salsa bar. You can't go wrong here, just don't expect it to be a 5 minute quick burrito stop."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Nice place with outdoor dining. food is large and good for the price. Very friendly staff. Only complaint, ordered a burrito with out cheese and sour cream. The burrito came out half of the normal size."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,The best Mexican food we have had in years. The salsa bar is amazing! Best halibut tacos and guacamole! Love it! Cannot wait to go back! Great chips too!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Went there for breakfast and it was great.  Large menu for breakfast.  The only bummer was they didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 on the morning I was there.  I assume they usually do.  Breakfast was as good as lunch/dinner with a completely new menu.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,Super disappointing. Not as good as New Baja Grill before it and nowhere near as good as both other Los Agaves locations in SB. My wet burrito was almost lukewarm and just tasted like salt. Servers also forgot chips. Only positive was that it was quick.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This restaurant is one of many small restaurants that surround our very popular movie theater in Goleta.  All of these small restaurants are walk in type,  order at the counter,  get a number and sit outside on the patio and wait for your order to arrive.  I must say the menu is much more extensive than I thought it would be.  They have virtually everything a walk in sit down restaurant would serve and it's perfectly cooked.   If we're in the mood for a Mexican restaurant before or after the next movie,  we'll come back."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Well I have been here two different times and I must say that the food is always spot on. I can't give it 5 stars only because they have also consistently messed up orders on both visits. First visit ordered the Pork Pazole.....it arrived as chicken. Second trip ordered something and specifically asked for no tomatoes.....it arrived with tomatoes.  That being said, the staff were quick to correct the issues both times and the food was delicious and that's why I will go back again....because although there were errors in the preparations on two separate occasions, the food is good and errors were corrected quickly."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I won't add too all the other positive reviews of the agaves burrito except to say it's as good as advertised! But the real surprise was the salad that came with it: fresh greens, mandarin slices, raisins, and a delicious dressing. Way more than the typical side salad.  The chile relleno was tasty too but maybe a little too drenched in cheese... if that's even possible."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Best Mexican food and service in Goleta and Santa Barbara. Salsa Bar is AMAZING.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Mexican food is my favorite type and I normally like everything and anything I get, so I suppose I had high expectations. Los Agaves was good, but not great; I was slightly disappointed by the bland, dry chicken in my meal. The salsas were delicious, though, and definitely improved the plate. 
The restaurant itself is very nice with pretty outdoor seating and decor!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Needed a good reliable bite.  Found this place on Yelp.  Excellent food and fast.  We had burritos and those came out fresh and hot.  As expected.  If I'm passing through the area I will stop in next time.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"My goodness....why is this place so far from my home??!!  Driving thru the area and craving some good Mexican food. Pulled up this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try. Not super easy to find since it's sandwiched between other eateries in a strip mall, but so worth the effort. I'll gladly drive the 3 hours to come back!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"For what it is, it is fine. It is an order at the counter, get a number kind of place. The mexican food was good. Nothing special, but that is what you expect for the reasonable price point. Very very few non-cheese vegetarian options. I had a salad and it was pretty bad."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This place has the best Mexican food I've ever eaten. We happened to stumble across it looking for breakfast. I grew up in Los Angeles and have been to a hundred Mexican restaurants in my lifetime. My girlfriend, who was born in Mexico agrees this place was amazing. We had the nopales con huevos and chicken chiliquiles. Their salsa was amazing as well. When we get back to Santa Barbara we are definitely making a stop in there."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Fav place to get bomb Mexican food! I love getting a simple bean rice and guac burrito, but everything I have tried on their menu is delicious, fresh, and full of flavor!  I also love their chips and avocado salsa! The employees are always smiling and very friendly and helpful, and I love the vibe of the restaurant! I like sitting outside on the patio (: Even when it's super busy during dinner rush, the food comes out fast and consistently looking delicious!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Very friendly service. Great salsa bar. Mole Enchiladas. Tacos el Pastor are my favorite!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Expensive but really good and fresh food!

Ceviche tostada was amazing and refreshing. The fish was fresh and seasoned well with some lime and was perfect with the creamy avocado and fresca that accompanied it. 

The earth and sea molcajete was also delicious. It comes in a big black stone pot and is filled with a hot stew with all kinds of meat, chicken, steak, sausage, and shrimp as well as peppers, cheese, and onion. They come with handmade tortillas so you can make your own tacos, and you can ask for up to 2 more if you run out without extra charge. 

Food was very satisfying and filling and the service was friendly."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Have never been disappointed! This restaurant, at any of their three locations, is outstanding. Always great service also. Tonight was a first time ordering nachos, best In Santa Barbara! If you want great Mexican food this is the place."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,From start to finish- great! The cheese enchiladas were perfect. I loved the rice and the presentation was wonderful. Pomegranate margarita is a most try.  The only reason 4 is a dang fly that would mot leave us alone.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Crowed and Noisy, but I do not begrudge them their sucess.
Their other locations in Santa Barbara suffer the same problems. 
Show up at odd hours for a more peaceful, less crowded meal.
I will not go there during rushed periods."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Be sure to call before you make the trip. Our party showed up Monday at 11:30 am to have lunch. The sign said ""open at 11:00 am"" but no one was around., doors locked and chairs sitting on top of tables. We watched several people walk up to the front door only to turn and leave in disgust. One said place may be closing. Try ""Lily's "" super good tacos. We did and now it's our favorite."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I'm a HUGE believer in the whole you eat with your eyes before your mouth logic and this place scored big points on presentation. They were bringing out plate by plate and they kept making me hungrier and hungrier while waiting in line. Love that they serve the beans in a tortilla bowl because it saves the mess they tend to make on a plate and it gives you something extra to eat with the beans. The portions are pretty generous too. I got their ceviche and after my first bite I already knew how good the rest of the food would be. I've been to quite a few places who have butchered the art that is ceviche but this place got it down. Not the best but still really good. As for the other food, I got the 3 item combo plate with enchiladas (beef and chicken) and a deep fried taco. Mmmmmm. Both enchiladas had a hefty amount of meat in them and they give you your moneys worth with their meals. Not a fancy and expensive restaurant but their food is equal to a high end restaurant. Haven't tried too any other Mexican food places in SB but after eating here I have no reason to either."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I came here a couple times before I finally understood the hype behind this place, but I guess I just had to order something I liked. Service is great, even when they're busy which is often. It can be hard to find a table when they're busy though. I highly recommend the mole enchiladas and agua de jamaica."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,I have never really appreciated a Mexican food like this one. Small place but delicate dishes! Although I can't understand anything on their Manu: no picture and imaginable English! Server could help you with right choice though.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This is pretty much the perfect place for a treat-yoself, nice brunch out with some friends kinda meal! 

If you've been reading other reviews and aren't convinced: SALSA BAR. FREE REFILLS ON CHIPS. Not convinced? You're a liar.

This place gets pretty packed on the weekend, so I'd be prepared to wait. The price IS a bit steep, but it's acceptable considering the portion sizes are pretty good and like I said, chip party.

My friends all got burritos and were satisfied with the taste. I appreciate the little pyramid of flavored rice and guac that came with all our orders! I ordered what appears to be a hybrid between a quesadilla and a burrito... (Forgot the name GG) it was kinda meaty, kinda cheesy, kinda spicy, and all heaven. Really good. If that was useless info to you, it at least entitles me to say that I ordered something here and I loved it (sorry, I tried). 

Food came out pretty quickly, there's a good amount of indoor/outdoor seating, the waitress was nice and answered my questions thoroughly, and everything seemed clean!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Kinda pricey, but it is in a fancy shopping center, so what did I expect. Food is very good."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Just went this past Friday. Our table ordered 3 agaves burritos , one was vegetarian. 

The waiter came with an agaves burrito, says ""agaves burrito"" and i said, is it vegetarian? and he said...""i think so??"".  So then he puts it down and tells us its vegetarian with the most uncertain tone. 5 minutes later after my friend took a bite, another waiter comes and says, ""vegetarian agaves burrito?"" Utterly dumbfounded.They take that burrito away and we are confused if the first one was even vege. Don't they know some people are highly allergic to shrimp/seafood? 

You think thats irresponsible? We finally get one non vegetarian agaves burrito after another 5 minutes. Then while I'm waiting for our last, another waiter came out with receipts trying to argue with me that our table only had 2 burritos. Really testing my patience there.

I'm pretty sure I didn't come out to eat so I can have an argument about what I ordered and how they can't even keep track. Lo and behold as she is trying to prove her point repeatedly interrupting my table for 5 minutes telling us we didn't order another burrito, another waiter comes and says, ""agaves burrito number 20?"" ... which was for my table. 

So all in all, I can pretty much say it was the worst service I ever experienced. They couldn't even tell which burrito was vegetarian. Terrible Service, I didn't mind the line, or waiting for 30 minutes, but to wait 30 minutes and have them be so sloppy then accuse me of things. Not cool."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,The chipotle salsa is great..I ordered the ceviche...also great .add a michelada and you are good to go.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Legitimately superb food.  They put big, firm, delicious shrimp in the agaves burrito and agaves enchiladas, and the sauce on those things - I have NO idea what is in that sauce, but it is incredible.  Creamy, nicely seasoned, and a great complement to the otherwise one-dimensional savoriness of the rest of the dish.  I am a huge fan of their aguas frescas too - the chia seeds in the cucumber agua fresca are a great touch.  Fam also always gets the ceviche tostada.  It makes for a nice, fresh bite in between all the heavier food.  Overall, I am a huge fan."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Los Agaves is our ""go to"" Mexican restaurant"" - we like the one on de la Vina only because it is closer than their other 2 locations.  We think the food is creative (love their guacamole!). I tell my husband that he has to order something other than Molcajaetes, but he has gotten hooked and has it every time we go.  We often take out of town friends to Los Agaves, and they have all enjoyed it.  The restaurant gets a get a little chaotic during meal times (it's not that large a restaurant), but the staff is knowledgeable and friendly; once you place your order it doesn't take long to get it.  We like eating ""on the street"" if the weather is nice. Good draft beer, too!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This place can be hectic, especially considering the location. When UCSB is back in session, it's overflowing with people. My choice is to utilize their pick-up order system, which can be super quick! You call in an order, pick it up at the little register farthest to the left, skip the line ...

The salsa station can be crowded and people can be inconsiderate, but the staff is always great, accommodating and efficient. The salmon tacos are delicious; the bean and cheese burrito is a reliable choice as well. My boyfriend loves the fajita burrito with steak. I would definitely recommend this place and, if you choose to sit and stay, enjoy the outside patio."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"The nachos here are the best nachos I have ever eaten. Every order is baked to perfection. The ingredients come together so it feels like a single dish rather than a lot of stuff on chips like the nachos from other places.
The other food is good too, but I never remember much of it because the nachos are just better.

It is pricey however, especially since there are so many other solid mexican choices in the area. I think the nachos are worth the price."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Another awesome meal.   This is a must stop each time I visit the area.   Shrimp tacos in a fluffy flour tortilla.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I've been going to Los Agaves for years now, since the Milpas location first opened which has to be 10-15 years ago.  Simply amazing food.  Hands down the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara County.  The Gringas al Pastor, (a special that's been around seemingly forever) is one of my favorite dishes anywhere.  Los Agaves Enchiladas are out of this world as well.  Pretty much can't go wrong here.  Incredible salsa bar as well."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Hands down, my absolute favorite place to enjoy fresh and tastes Mexican food. I've tried just about everything on their menu, but my favorites are the Agaves enchiladas, molcajete (seafood one), the nachos (definitely for sharing), and the Plato Placero de Arrachera. Also, the staff are friendly and very attentive. 

They have many fresh salsas to choose from to dip with fresh tortilla chips. The fresh tortillas they make in house also elevate their dishes.

The margaritas are tasty as well. It's definitely one of the many places in Santa Barbara and Goleta, you must go to eat. You won't be disappointed."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This is the second Los Agaves location that I have been to. I've been here twice so far-once for lunch, once for dinner. Both times the place was packed, but fortunately the line moves pretty quickly and the service was prompt. I ordered the Ensalada Vallarta on one occasion, and the garden burrito (sans dairy) on another. The food was very tasty and fresh. I am happy they offer vegan-friendly options. The presentation seemed to be a bit messier than the De La Vina location, maybe it was because they are still pretty new. I'll be back for sure to see if the quality comes to match the other location. I am happy they have the same salsa bar as the other locations, because I can't get enough of it! The assortment and flavors of salsas they offer can't be beat!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Really great fish tacos. Came here for lunch and were able to find a seat. I will say it took a little while for food to come out but tasted fresh and was very flavorful! Will definitely try again.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I have no complaints about this new location. Been here once for dinner. Service was fast and friendly, and my friend was very surprised how fast the food came out! Same delicious food as their primary location in downtown SB. I got a chimichanga burrito with shredded beef which was delicious. My friends got seafood and chicken fajitas. Our food was fresh, hot, and amazing! Our food was hot and our plates cold = fresh food and not heated! Friendly staff, doing a great job clearing tables and checking up on customers, delivering more chips or taking empty dishes. My burrito was about $10, which I think was a very fair price considering the size and quality of my meal! You definitely get what you pay for. Highly recommend, don't be afraid of this new location! Outside seating is pretty and has some heaters for the evening."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"i chose this place because of how good the ratings were, but I ordered the steak tostada salad and it honestly tastes pretty fishy and the lettuce looks old and flimsy. I can barely finish it and the thing was $14 so I don't think I'll be back"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Great crispy shredded beef tacos, but the chile rellenos didn't meet up to my expectations. 
The appetizer chips are semi-soft, break easily; not dry and crisp. Excellent service otherwise."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"I'm not sure this chain should expand. The consistency at this particular location is lacking and does not meet the other two in SB. It really sucks when you order your favorite burrito and there are no beans. To top it off everything including the Guac was under whelming and lacked seasoning. This location caters to a ""different"" pallet or let's say a more sensitive pallett Go the distance to another location it will be worth the drive. So disappointed"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I stayed at a nearby hotel and just randomly decided to have dinner at this place and i can say that this is one of the best Mexican restaurants i have ever been to...food was really good and at very reasonable rates...fast service, extremely friendly and very hard working staff. Loved it and went back again."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"The food here is delicious and I really appreciate the great quality of ingredients. I have tried something new each time I go, and everything has been great so far. 

I'm not sure this location was the best choice. Convenient spot, but seems to be too small. This place gets overcrowded and the lines are often long. There should be a separate line for pickup orders. They should buy the building next door (that sub-par sushi joint that is still open for some reason) and expand. 

I've ordered to go every time but once so far. The service has always been exceptional and friendly, and also quite quick for how busy it is (once you have ordered)."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I've done dine in here and it is a fun atmosphere. Service is very fast -- even when they are full.

I've gone in for takeout when the place was packed and there were people in line to order and others just standing around waiting for their own take out orders. Time from when I placed an order to getting my food was 9 minutes one time and 7 another. I don't know how the staff don't go crazy with how fast the pace is!

Try the Chicken Mole Enchiladas -- you get two huge enchiladas (more like burrito size) which are stuffed with chicken and a little cheese, smothered in excellent mole sauce with rice and beans. This is big enough to share for a meal."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Like others have said, the food is on point but the service is what is best.  Sarah always remembers my order and goes the extra mile to make sure no one waits and makes sure you know that she wants you to come back.  A few weeks ago, I joked with Sarah and told her she needs a twin, Sarah laughed and called Alyssa over...her twin!  Go here if you want great food....fast and service by workers who are genuinely happy you came to ""visit""!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"First, salsa bar is amazing. None of the salsas will let you down! Although some might surprise you with a kick!  
Second, the Burrito Mojado is a must try! I'd recommend wetting the burrito more with the Avocado salsa. 
Third, the huarache is also a great plate to try. Though it could be messy, it is a tasty thin-like sope."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"We dropped in on our drive to Southern California. The reviews were good and it was close to the freeway exit.  Boy, we are glad we tried it! Beautiful presentation, fresh ingredients and delicious and inventive recipes! It's in a nice shopping center with patio seating. It's right next to a movie theater and Starbucks.  I'm sure it's always busy. We will be back!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,I love its CHIPOTLE SAUCE!! Thank you Alex Park my bro. It was awesome. This is the best britto I've ever had.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Stopped by for lunch with my husband and daughter. We all had outstanding food; garden burrito, chicken burrito, and grilled salmon tacos. Chips and salsa are complimentary and excellent also. We will definitely be back!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Love this place and so glad they have a spot in Goleta now!! Everything I've had is delicious but my favorites are the Molcajetes and the Torta Cubano. Oh and the chips and salsa are free, fresh and amazing."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Service is sub par. Waiter seemed irritated and rude when the food was served to my friends and I. It wasn't clear what he was bringing out and got annoyed when we were confused at what he said. They failed to bring out a side of guacamole my friend had ordered until 20 minutes after we had gotten our food. A waitress had even questioned if we were sure we hadn't received it already. Food was just fine, but we left disappointed because their abysmal service and attitude towards their patrons."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Just okay, really. 

I went last week, so I figure that I'll try it again in a few months when they really get the ball rolling with their new location. That said, I generally find their food to good but a bit overrated in any of their locations. I've never had what I felt was a truly excellent meal at any of the locations. 

I ordered the cheese and chicken enchiladas when I visited the Marketplace location and they were pretty standard. They weren't bad at all, just not what I'd call remarkable. The best thing about the visit was that I managed to time it so that I got some hot, just made chips.  They were pretty tasty. 

The salsa bar had a bunch of salsas missing in action, weird for just around 1 p.m. on a weekday. But again, could be just new-ish opening lag? 

In terms of the service, they were friendly enough, but the people working the register seemed a little slow and lost. My server, though, was friendly and quick and she even brought me a fork when she realized I'd forgotten to pick one up for myself. 

Bottom line: Does it say a lot that I kind of miss New Baja Grill when thinking about my experience at Los Agaves?"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Live close by, great food. Their Burrito Mojado is amazing. I usually get it with the Suiza sauce to top it instead of the red sauce that it usually comes with, but either one is still great."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,Food would probably be solid if it werent for them completely overloading dishes with cheese. But that seems to be a trend here in SB.  Nachos & chimichanga oozing with so much cheese just the sight of it made me gag. My husband and i were scooping it out by the bucketful & had such large piles of cheese goo on our plates we lost our appetites. IF i come back i will order meals w no cheese.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"One star because the service is horrible. They messed up a bunch of our to go orders, half came out in 5 minutes the others came out in 30 minutes.  Go to the one on State Street instead."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"I've eaten at this location a couple of times. The food is a little pricey but pretty good, a 3.5/5 in my opinion. But I have no idea how the catering service is; nor will I, because after two emails requesting a quote with no response, I asked in person only to learn they are unavailable for catering on the requested date due to UCSB commencement weekend traffic. While I completely respect their prerogative to withhold services under special circumstances, the lack of communication regarding this matter is unacceptable. That was a complete waste of time and gasoline to hear what could have instead been settled by a prompt, succinct email."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"The food was ""ok"" for Americanized Mexican. The chips were good, the steak taco was good but needed something besides a soft tortilla and meat. My crispy chicken taco came with sour cream and chili sauce and was tasty. I have never seen pinto beans that are a kind of Yellowish / Brown color - must be the sauce.

Nice location and ambiance. Good service."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Careful vegetarians! Neither their rice nor their beans are vegetarian, as both are made with chicken stock. Some servers will tell you sometimes they are vegetarian, but the managers have told me they are not."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Somewhat self serve place. You pay first and they give you a number. The drink station and salsa bar always have a line but there is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. 

The rice is amazing and on Tuesday's, they have $2 tacos and beer specials"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"It's a little pricy but so is everything else in the area. Nice small restaurant, good food and nice staff.

I had the ceviche tostada. For the price you might not like the fact that it's only 1 tostada but the size of the meal makes up for it. The tostada came with enough ceviche and chips that it feels like you're eating 3 tostadas.

For the price and serving size, buy one entree and share it with a friend."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"It's been the hottest it's been in awhile in Santa Barbara but somehow this place manages to make the enchiladas cold. The ceviche was pretty much the free salsa bar salsa with warm chunks of fish in it. My wife and I sat at a table only to be told that the table was reserved.... it had no reservation sign on it and nobody sat at the table for 20 min. Overall a bad experience, but it might just be at this location."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Il not into chain restaurants but my daughter wanted lunch here. Everything is way too expensive and overpriced in my opinion. My burrito wasn't anything special but I thought the salad that came with it was much better. I should've ordered the salad but that was also overpriced. 
The service was good and friendly. The place was kept clean and the staff was attentive and made sure everything was tidy. Their salsa selection was bigger than most places I've seen and even had a habanero option (but still mild for me)."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I am a huge, huge fan of Los Agaves. I used to visit their first location on Milpas for my treasured chicken chimichanaga and dealt with that tiny parking lot around back and limited street parking. Then they opened the location on De La Vina, which was closer but still had parking issues. Now- finally- Carlos Luna, the owner, has opened up a location within a few blissful minutes of me. Camino Real has plenty of parking! It's on my drive home from work! It's nearby to all the stores I run weekend errands at! Sweet baby Jesus, have mercy on my waistline.

My first meal at this new location was the agaves burrito. My coworker recommended it, and while I'm not a huge fan of seafood, this burrito was awesome. The chipotle sauce on it provides just enough of a kick. The burrito is accompanied by their yummy Mexican rice, and a salad. You can opt out of the salad and get it with extra rice or a side of beans, if you don't like salad. The burrito is quite large and provided me with leftovers for another meal as usual. I ordered the sea and earth molcajetes the next day. Now, this had too much spice for me so I didn't eat all of it. The serving was still very generous and it would have lasted two meals. 

My big beef with Los Agaves? There is no separate line or register for picking up to-go orders. The line to order & pay is usually very long with indecisive families looking at menu's. I always order to-go. My main goal is to get my food and get the hell out of there (I don't like crowds or most other people, to be honest). 

Also, the prices have risen. Over the past opening weekend- when I visited three times, ahem- I was charged more than the advertised price for each item. The printed menus and the website are out of date and need to be updated.

P.S. The owner, Carlos, always wears his shirt unbuttoned on top. I kinda want to touch his chest hair for some odd reason."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I'm a fan of the Los Agaves salad with shrimp.  I have it nearly once a week because it's so tasty.  My biggest complaint is having to wait for them to make it (I always get my order after the others in the party), but it's worth the wait.  I can't tell you about another of the other food there since I've only eaten this salad, but it's one of my favorites."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Los Agaves never disappoints.  It is my go-to burrito place.  The avacado salsa is amazing!  The atmosphere in the Camino Marketplace is fun, especially when there is a farmer's market."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"this is my go to restaurant in goleta/SB. i love the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. after you order, they bring you warm tortilla chips that are so amazing. love this place"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,The food was amazing. The portion size was really great. I took 1 star off because the waitress asked me if I wanted a refill on chips and I said yes but then she never came back with them. I reminded her twice.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"I've visited this place for dinner once or twice before, and have always had a good experience. The food's pretty tasty! I especially like their rice and guacamole. This time, I ordered the fajita burrito, which came with rice and guacamole, and I ordered an horchata. The food's was good, but the service was TERRIBLE! The guy at the counter was this big man (he might have been the owner or the manager) that was either just grumpy, or was having a bad day. But he wasn't very friendly at all! I ordered and have him my card to pay, and he asked if I had cash to pay with, and when I said no, he shook his head like I was stupid for not carrying cash around like that. (Like I was the only one who did that) So I placed my order, then went to find a seat outside since all the tables inside were taken. I went back to ask if they could clear out a table for me. Still without smiling, like I was being a nuisance, he said he'd send someone out. 

So once the table was cleared, I asked if the patio heater thing could be turned on, since I was feeling a bit cold. The waitress said she'd get someone to do it. Time went by and no-one came out to turn on the heater and give me chips. My order came and still no chips. So I had to flag down the waitress and ask for my chips and ask for the heater to be turned on again. That request was met with the usual 'yes, I'll go get that right now', and it got forgotten yet again. I asked again, this time she came back with my chips, and STILL no one came to turn on the dang heater! By then I was getting uncomfortably cold, so being that my request was ignored several times, I just asked for a box and got out of there. I went home sniffling from the cold which could have been avoided quite easily. I'm also upset that I tipped right as I paid. If only I'd known that the service was going to be so horrible, maybe I would've skipped it altogether. Lesson learned, next time I'll bring cash to to with after the meal. I know that they were busy, and I kept my requests polite, but it seemed like they were paying more attention to some tables more than others, and the whole experience was pretty frustrating. Hire more staff for busy days, and train them to focus on the customers needs much more. And you should probably have a friendlier person at the register. It's very off putting when you have some grouch serving your customers."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"We got the chile rellenos plate and the enchiladas roja plate, with the passion fruit iced tea and horchata. We sat outside and went 30 minutes without getting our food. Turns out, there was some malfunction and our order got lost. We were both pretty upset, but didn't say much at first. Who we believe was the manager came and apologized and comped our entire dinner! He went far beyond expectations, it was very sweet and of course, we forgave them! 

Of course I've got to add how amazing the food was, we plan to go again! Although they could step up their beans and rice game a bit. Refried beans, maybe??"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Just as good as the downtown location. I've been there a few times, and haven't seen any issues with the registers or whatnot. The service has also been great. The staff seemed like they knew what was going on, and were prompt and responsive. 
Having ordered several of the same items at both this location, and the main one, I'd definitely say the food is equally as good."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Hidden jewel in Goleta! Don't let its location fool you - mouth-watering entrees are one-of-a-kind! We stumbled upon the location after shopping at Costco & were pleasantly surprised!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Amazing food and super fast service in a very busy restaurant. Los Agaves Salad with chicken was delicious. I will stop here every chance I get.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Excellent service, environment, and quality Mexican food. The outside servers were among some of the best waitstaff we've ever had. I had the halibut tacos, and they were delicious- especially with mango salsa."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"*** MOLE MOLE MOLE ***

I remember having Los Agaves mole at the other location. Mole is a sauce of complexity that makes your tastebuds dance. I'm always in on delicious mole since making it myself would mean 20+ ingredients. Someday I will make mole...maybe in a couple years..? Haha.. 

Chicken Mole Enchiladas -- As I remember it although I thought this one had a tad bit more spiciness to it? After a bite of the molcajetes, I thought that it was not spicy anymore...lol. Two chicken enchiladas with a generous about of mole sauce served with rice and beans(beans were in a crunchy tortilla cup). 

Molcajetes -- Ooh spicy!! My husband ate most of this. I don't remember much since I was focused on enjoying mole. Grilled nopal, onions, peppers, salsa, avocado. Spicy, spicy. 

Free chips and salsa. 

Yes, it is a bit expensive but if I were to make that mole sauce, I would be spending much more.

Can I just buy bottles of mole sauce from them and put it on everything? Please, pretty please?? Getting hungry just imagining it..."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Holy cow...definitely worth the drive! I see many return visits in my future! I got the Anaheim Poblanos and it was layered in flavor, can't wait to return!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Best Mexican restaurant! Hands down my favorite. Try the Molcahete and Chili Nortenos!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,This place is way to expensive for what you get. I got 2 small tacos and the smallest side of rice and beans I have every seen and a drink and it cost me $18. They slopes the sauce on so it made it really messy to eat the taco. Would not recommend this place. The one on state street is 100 times better
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"There are few spots in Santa Barbara, but in this location everything is great, starting from the food and ending with the staff, I ordered quesadilla and it was cooked just right. They have a salsa bar that was pretty good. Didn't wait for the food as much."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,So delicious!!!! Best Mexican food nearby! Not expensive and worth waiting! Seafood here is so fresh!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Been there a few times and enjoyed the atmosphere, sitting outside. Really liked the chicken nachos. Fast and friendly service. Unfortunately, a dealbreaker was my recent experience when I found several pieces of steak in my ""chicken"" nachos. Since it was dark outside, it was impossible to see what was exactly on the plate and I ate most of it before noticing the steak contamination. I do not eat beef! This tells me that their cooks do not pay attention and do not care (or are too busy) to keep their ingredients separate. Eat at your own risk."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Excellent food, with excellent execution, in a non-typical location, by a movie theater, in a strip mall.
I have yet to have a bad dish here: the seafood dishes are great, enchiladas and Camron Guajilla... Mole is awesome, carne asada dishes are great! To top it off, there is a large, home made salsa bar, and fresh chips. 
The place gets really busy during rush hours. Since this is a local chain, there are two more locations available - Milpas is always busy, but De La Vina is not so bad."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"love los agaves so much!!! we moved here about 6 months ago and it's a new favorite for sure. my favorite is the enchiladas quadalajares with green sauce that's kinda spicy. the chicken is shredded and so moist with a little bit of spice and cheese in it. when you sit down, they give you complementary fresh, hot tortilla chips. they have a nice salsa bar to choose from too. It's very hard not to fill up on chips while you wait for the food. we go here as much as possible and sometimes it's hard to find a table at night. they are always busy but the food comes out pretty quick. it's so good i'm hungry just thinking about it"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,This place is so good lol. Just a tad pricy! The salsa bar is very good and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,The food is great. But they have messed up my order 5 times at this location. Horrible. Great food but horrible service when it comes to getting your order right. Love the downtown locations. Much better.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Los Agaves is a cute & simple small restaurant nestled in the Camino Real Shopping Place. Los Agaves seems to be popular with customers of all ages! Since it isn't that far from UCSB, many of the students frequent this place while shopping or for a fix of chips and salsa. 

Location: Conveniently located next to Costco, Camino Real Cinemas, Starbucks, Ulta, etc. 

Food: Okay, Very good in Santa Barbara/Goleta standards but bad in LA standards. 

Price: About $16.00 for a quesadilla and horchata. Ive spent $25 for a molcajete and horchata. Decent pricing for a sit down place like this. 

My personal expeniece: I have visited this place a couple of this with my housemates/friends. When it comes to the customer service, I have always left satisfied. However, the food itself has left a lot to be desired, although all the foods I've had have been edible, some where mediocre at best. The horchata isn't as good as I would have hoped for being home made. If I where to ever sit this place again, I will definitely only want the chips and salsa, because their salsa selection is actually VERY TASTY! I would definitely choose to only purchase a chips and salsa combo and maybe an alcoholic beverage."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Definitely a plan of this place. This was a second restaurant my cousin recommended! 

Since I am here for a work trip, my coworkers and I decided to come by here for dinner. MAN WAS IT PACKED! We also came on a good day (Taco Tuesday). They had 3 different crispy tacos and multiple types of regular ""suave"" tacos. I got 2 crispy pollos with a side of Spanish rice and a Lagunitas IPA. My beer came out first, YASSSSSS!, and then my tacos came out about 10 mins after. While waiting, they also bring out chips to you. There's an open salsa bar with a huge variety of different types of salsas on deck. 

Once my tacos came out, I was so excited to try it! I love crispy tacos like these! I make them myself at home, but with beef. While eating, their tacos had the perfect crunch AND IT WAS NOT GREASY AT ALL. I was very surprised! That was definitely a plus for me! With the salsa in my taco, I take a bite. Then I get a swig of the IPA.....PERFECTION! 

If you are ever in the area, you NEED TO COME HERE! It was delicious! Next time, I am definitely ordering one of their combo plates. It looked SO DARN YUMMY!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Overpriced fast food restaurant with a bad service. 
This restaurant smells like cheap cleaning solution when you walk in. 
Grilled chicken was black.  They sell inedible food."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"So I called this place just to  ask about bringing a group of 20 in to eat and the guy cut me off and said we don't take reservations.  I explained I just wanted to know if he might be able to handle our group.  His comment was we are too busy and was super rude.  No problem, we will take our money elsewhere."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"If you are ever in the Santa Barbara area, you have to try the Mexican food at Los Agaves!! Los Agaves is easily one of my favorite places for Mexican cuisine. This Goleta location is fairly new and great for college students at UCSB to grab a quick bite. However, the other Los Agaves locations in Downtown Santa Barbara are better. So if you're willing to make the drive or happen to be in DT SB, you should visit the Los Agaves there! 

In comparison to the DT SB location, the portion of food at the goleta location is smaller. Also the rice does not tastes as wonderful as the one in DT SB. 

Recommendations for food: 
-You can't go wrong with any of the enchiladas. My personal favorite are the seafood ones :)
-The Camarones Guajillo: mexican shrimp sauteed in butter with rice, salad, pineapples etc. is also one of my favorites!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,My favorite restaurant in SB/Goleta. Never disappoints and tastes like a $40 meal and costs less than $15.  Best Salsa around anywhere. I eat at all three locations at least 1 to 2 times a month.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,First time after a great time wine tasting. I had the chicken enchiladas mole and my girlfriend had the carnitas tacos mui Bueno for both. We will make this a regular stop when we come back to  up our wine!!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Well this place is usually good, I always get the Agaves burrito. However today, I got the Agaves burrito and near the end I realize they skipped out on the shrimp. Sucks, it didn't taste as good."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Come to Denver, Los Agaves!  Craving Mexican food but staying at Bacara.....I cabbed it to this place and was thrilled! I had no idea what to get, but most people on Yelp were happy no matter what they chose.  The line was long, I arrived at noon, but it moved quickly and soon I wished I had sat by myself at a table for four!  They brought so much food! I had fajitas Del Mar, and the fish and shrimp tasted delicious and fresh, came with veggies, corn tortillas rice and salad/ guacamole. The salsa bar is amazing so I had to get several salsas!  They bring free chips-it was a feast that I couldn't finish!  Yes, it was pricey, but I recommend sharing if you have someone to eat with.  I ordered flan, but they were out.  They brought me a chocolate vanilla candy coated ice creamy delicious bomb of some sort with nuts and a cherry in the middle, mmmmm! They have a big menu, even mole sauce!  They have indoor and outdoor seating, shade and sun seating with beautiful gardens around the seating area.  They serve alcohol. You order at the counter but they bring it to you, and they bus the tables.  Nice fast casual dining!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Fine Mexican food and good service - wait was a tad long, but definitely recommend this place!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Amazing food and friendly service. Do expect a line during peak hours. They offer complimentary chips & even have a complete salsa bar! 

My recommendations:
1) the Agaves Burrito: It has halibut, shrimp, guacamole & all that good stuff inside. If you love chipotle sauce as much as I do, you'll love this burrito because it's SMOTHERED in it. Yum! Also comes with rice as a side, which I LOVE. Not a fan of the sweet tasting salad (mango dressing) they have as a side, but it goes well with the burrito. TRY IT! It's flippin' delicious. 

2) the Molcajete: it's sooooo freaking good. I usually get the steak molcajete but they have other options like chicken, shrimp, etc. It's hard to explain what's inside...there's a whole buncha good stuff like salsa, avocado, peppers, and cactus (nopal???). I didn't know what a molcajete was until I had it here. And if you're like me and you don't know what it is, imagine a big cauldron with yummy & bubbling goodness. It'll definitely fill you up and then some!!! I always have a lot leftover so plan to share or to-go if you've got a small stomach. 

***Their fountain water tastes SUPER FISHY...which is a downside for me because I almost always drink water with everything. And their menu is kinda pricy, but the portions are huge so I guess it sorta balances out. It also gets really stuffy indoors during the day so enjoy your meal outside in their super nice outdoor seating :)"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,I love going to this place! I always try something different on the menu to see what other tasty food they have and I haven't been disappointed. The salsa bar is great! They are always friendly staff and. Even though the lines may look long it actually goes by very quickly.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Fish tacos were perfectly seasoned with a lightly marinated slaw. Hubby had the salsa Verde burrito. Servings were generous and food was fresh and nicely presented. 6 different kinds of salsa for your chils. Owner walked around and kept things clean and neat!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Super yummy! 100% recommend this place. The tortilla chips are great and they have a huge (delicious) salsa bar with tons of options. I got the Los Agaves salad with salmon, and it was wonderful. The salmon was cooked perfectly!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"What a wonderful surprise! I'm of Mexican decent & I loved the authentic food with a new freshness. Ingredients appeared fresh & the combinations worked well. I had the Tacos al Mar w/Halibut - delicious!  Fish was fresh, salad with Mango dressing -loved it! Daughter had Alambres w/Chicken. The chicken had a great bbq charred flavor - also delicious! Tortillas are authentic,  Jamaica is well made. Not that fast food stuff.  And to top it all off, service is better than most restaurants!  Staff says the food names correctly in Spanish! The staff walks around to assure everything is on point! Can't wait to return.  I do however have a request,  can we get calorie count on menu? Thanks again!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Los Agaves has the best Mexican food in Santa Barbara, maybe in California!  Just go there, it's awesome!  And the people there are super nice too!  I had the Seafood Enchiladas for the third time.....everything is soooooo good!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I am impressed.

Low down:
Great customer service | Lovely ambiance | tasty food | satisfying serving size | fair pricing | indoor&outdoor seating | In plaza, so plenty of parking | reasonable wait time to order and get food

Bit higher up:
I am on work travel from LA and came here for dinner. Customer service was pleasant all the way thru from handing me the menu to handing me the food. I ordered the Tampiquena and was more than happy. It had two large slabs of carne, an enchilada, still crunchy taquito (twas a to-go order), beans, 3 small but thick flour tortilla, and a bag of chips. Big props for not skimping out and supplying LARGE sauce cups. They are a very reasonable two dollar sign place. I am cheap and tend to avoid that extra dollar sign, but since work is paying for it...I splurged. Highly recommend and might even come back on my own dollar"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,This was my first time here and let me tell you the food was great! I will for sure be back soon!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"For 4 years attending UCSB ive tried this place about 10 times and tried the entire menu. YES they are all really breath-taking and delicious. But I always have a little regret on their prices as ""mexican"" food. When we think about Chinese food we think about deep fried fast food, good amount food for couple bucks. When we think korean, we think about all you can eat korean bbq. When we think about mexican food we think about CHEAP BOMB MUNCHIES. Honestly I understand they use higher quality stuff here but its double what I pay everywhere else. I don't usually complain about the prices but its pretty expensive for authentic mexican food. But again, their quality brings me back here and there."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,I've been to this location a few times but today when I got a to go order I didn't realize the salad I ordered came with a different dressing than the side salad. Server Kelsey saw something was wrong and quickly came back with the dressing I wanted. Not only is the food great but the service is phenomenal! Thanks Kelsey! I will definetly keep coming to this location.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Los Agaves has really good food but recently I had a bad experience with the nachos I usually order, the chips were burnt, the beans were really dry and there was hardly any cheese. I understand that they get really busy at times but I feel like the quality of the food should not suffer! Don't get me wrong tough, they have great food which explains the long lines and the staff is very friendly and attentive"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Mole was delicious, had a great authentic flavor to it.  My husband had the child verde burrito which was also delicious.  This will definitely be on our list to go eat when in Goleta!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Authentic and filling mexican food. The burritos are huge and so delicious. Chips and salsa bar comes for free...nicer mexican food. Highly recommend if you are in need of a burrito that is more authentic than chipotle!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"You can get an $8 lunch for just $22!

2 entrees and 2 beers and a tip will cost around $80.

Are you sure you want to spend $80 at a place where you order at the counter?"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Great dish! I got the burrito and it was more filling than I ever would've imagined. Also the steak actually tastes like steak.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Enjoying our vacation in Santa Barbara has enabled us to enjoy some of the best dining experiences my husband and I have had in a long time! 

Los Agaves is seriously the best Mexican food I have ever had. There halibut ceviche is simply incredible and will be much missed on my return to the OC. Please consider opening another restaurant further south!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"They have really good food, fresh salsa bar. we recently ate there and had the ( Los agave burrito) which was really good, but they used a huge tortilla to wrap it and it was more tortilla a than I wanted. Burrito was smaller than they use to be yet same huge tortilla.  Maybe they should fill it up more..."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Here's the thing: I'm a huge Los Agaves fan... of the other locations. I was gifted the Axxess card this year and with it you're offered buy one get one 50% off on your first visit and a free drink with a meal after that. One day I was on my way to study at the starbucks next door, so I phoned in my order and said I'd be there around 30 minutes from then, if it could be ready then (key word: ready). I get there to find out that they were waiting for me to get there to start it. What was the point of ordering on the phone? The employee told me it would be soggy but I mean hey that's my problem I guess. So then I pulled out my axxess card for my drink and was told that they don't take it here. Oh. Well, here's a solution.. Don't advertise this location (in their defense they don't), but still offer the free beverage. It wouldn't hurt anybody because I'm not gonna buy one anyway. If the employee who served me is reading this, you're very kind, it's not you, it's the policy, don't feel bad. Food was good, servers are awesome. Overall, I think I'll stick to the other locations unless I'm desperate for that beef chimichanga.."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"I'm a fan of the other locations, but this one seems subpar. The service is way worse than the others and even taking out is a pain.  The servers seem to be mindless and not really care, probably because they all seem to be college students, and the person taking the orders was pretty deaf compared to other places,  which might be accounted for by the fact that there are more than 4 people doing nothing but chatting behind the counter at all times. They also got my order wrong on multiple occasions already, which is amazing because they haven't been open for long now... it's somewhat intriguing how I can say ""agaves burrito"" multiple times, then they repeat it back to me ""agaves burrito"" and then I get home, finding an order of enchiladas... I drive back to fix it, and have to wait another 10 minutes on top of the 15 min drive to get it. At least they politely apologized, but that's it..."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Damn good food. Stopped by on a Monday after noon on Memorial Day and this place was pretty darn busy. It's a walk-in and order with self seating(indooror outdoor), plus the waiters here are awesome and the cooks are quick. Ordered a Burrito Mojado and fajitas and it came out pretty quick looking delicious and hot!! The food here was great! 
The waiters were super quick and friendly brining the complimentary tortilla chips and refills when the chips ran low. All in all I wish this place was in LA because I'd like to enjoy it often now without the long drive to this spot or the one in Thousand Oaks. Nevertheless, if I'm in the area, I'm stopping by no doubt. 
Finally, parking is easy as it's in a shopping center.
Enjoy!!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Just picked up my umpteenth take out order from this location. The order was wrong - ordered two two-item combinations - one had two incorrect items. One of the incorrect items which made it into both combination plates was the chile relleno - it tasted like dish soap. No, not a slight hint of dish soap, an overpowering aroma and mouth taste of dish soap - like they had been dunked in dirty soapy dish-water and put in the to-go box. Called them back to let them know and they offered to take the price of the rellenos off the bill - not the entirely wrong combination plate, or for that matter the entire bill - just the price of the soapy rellenos. 

I have eaten at all the Los Agaves locations and am a frequent diner - but seriously, you need to step it up. I know you're busy during the dinner rush and it's crazy back there, but I've also worked in busy kitchens and still managed to get orders right and good tasting food out to customers. 

I'll be taking a break from Los Agaves for a while."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Came in for the first time today on a rainy day and there was quite the line. However it moved quickly; they were also very dedicated to making sure we could get seats asap since it was a full house (only took a minute or two).

Food was absolutely scrumptious. Quesadillas were great, as were the taquitos. Forever memorable are those fresh, warm chips accompanied with what's from that salsa bar.

 All in all, delicious becomes Los Agaves. Thanks guys."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"This USED to be our favorite go-to for quick fresh yummy Mexican food. But not anymore. **BEWARE** of Taco Tuesday. They've removed carne asada from the Taco Tuesday deal. Ok, I get it, every business has to cut costs, etc. So we settled for crispy beef tacos. Turns out these could pass for Jack In the Box Value Tacos. Crispy shell with a dollop of beef. Taco Tuesday is  We won't be back to Los Agaves."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome.  The food was excellent and reasonably priced. Food came out quick but didn't look like it.   Don't worry if you see a line out the door. They knock out the line in no time. The staff are always actively cleaning up. Great place to come for a quick quality meal.

I had the beef chimichanga. It was crispy on the outside, not greasy. The beef was tender and flavorful.  Beans and rice are awesome too. 

I'm from out of town but will take the detour off the 101 to come back."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"This is an update from my previous review. 

I just wanted to thank whomever placed the unidentified black, burnt thing on top of my pyramid of rice the other day at lunch. No, I don't have a picture of it (the only thing I hate more than not being able to figure out what that thing was is taking a picture of my food in public) but it was about the size of a dime. 

I'm just going to assume that's what it was. 

What bothers me so much about this is that it should never have left the prep area like that. It was like that pimple you get on the end of your nose hours before a blind date. There is no way anyone involved didn't notice that thing. It should have been taken off by the person who set the plate up or the server should have asked the chef to take it off before it was served to me. The only reason it wasn't was either lack of caring or extreme laziness. 

Also, the cheese in one half of my my enchilada was so thick it seemed more like glue. The tortilla was hard and chewy in that area but strangely the other side was actually pretty good. How does that even happen? Was it some kind of coded message? Does this have something to do with the burnt thing on the rice pyramid? I would have so many questions if I cared to make the effort to find out. 

The second star is for the pretty good chips and salsa and the friendliness of everyone who works here."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Great quick service, the quality of the food is great, although it's a little bit Americanized."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I used yelp to order pick up while I was across the street at Costco. I ended up losing my credit card at Costco, so it took me a lot longer to get to Los Agaves than I thought. So when I showed up and it wasn't ready, I was surprised. Apparently the yelp order didn't go through properly or something, and when the owner realized this, he apologized and offered me a complimentary fountain drink and promised to get my order expedited. 

Since I had to go back to Costco to see if my card had been found, I suddenly realized I should get the sauce on the side so my burrito wouldn't get soggy, so I asked him if that could be done. He said of course, but when I got my burrito, it had sauce on it. Normally, I would just give up, because it's not a big deal. But after losing my credit card, I was in a grumpy mood, so I went back to reassert my request. The owner was extremely kind and not annoyed with me at all, and promptly made me a new burrito with the sauce and salad all separate so I could take it home and plate it myself later. That's how service should be. 

Also, the agaves burrito was delicious as always."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Let's talk about authenticity! Los Agaves is, without a doubt, the best Mexican food restaurant in Santa Barbara. 

My top favorites are chiles norteños, green chicken enchiladas, flautas tapatias and chicken sopes."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"A favorite among everyone I know.

The food is absolutely ravishing and consistently delivers to meet those cravings. A key spot that I always bring visitors to and they always fall in love with it, even wanting to eat there two days in a row. 

The staff are always friendly, courteous, speedy and kind. They also are very helpful with swapping out ingredients or side substitutions. 

Favorites are definitely the 1) Agaves Burrito (pictured), 2) Nachos 3) Enchiladas.

If you find the nachos feeling to heavy with meat, the vegetarian option is just as tasty without that overly full feeling."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Terrific food, and a super salsa bar.   Good service.  I usually buy a 3-way combination, eat half of it and then take the rest home in a take out container.  So for around $16 you really are getting 2 meals - $8 per meal essentially.  I love this place.   Keep up the good work!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"This new location is way more convenient than trying to find parking downtown. I usually opt for the Agaves enchiladas with halibut and a mango salsa on top. The salsa bar is half the reason I come here though, because there is an enormous selection of fairly fresh salsas. 

If you come in a large party anytime between 11:30-1, good luck trying to find any table that would accommodate more than two people. I understand that the rent for this place must be crazy, but the food price seems kind of high for casual sit-down mexican food (-1 star). It definitely beats anything in IV though. The place also isn't really that great if you have kids because of how crowded the interior is. I see kids running into food runners and spilling salsa all the time."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Absolutely horrible. Screwed up my order, which I didn't notice till I got it home, after waiting 20 minutes and not even having my name called. I finally came inside and it had been sitting there for who knows how long. Worst part though is the heavy chemical taste of the tortilla shell for the beans. My mouth is still stinging. Tasted like a mouth full of industrial soap. I've never tasted anything so awful. 

Used to like this place but it's gotten terrible in quality, service and still high prices. NEVER AGAIN."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Food was great, waitress, cashier, staff were so friendly, very clean. Was the best stop we made during our mini vacation. Food was served at a reasonable time and food was hot and ready to eat!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Los Agaves has nailed it as far as quality, quantity and customer service. Serving delicious food and pairing it with a yummy salsa bar makes this restaurant a go-to in Goleta. 

Im a sucker for good food and great service!!
I definitely appreciate the friendly service at the register while ordering food and attentiveness from the waiters once sitting down. 

I specifically had a superb experience from a waiter named Erick. He was very polite, friendly and his awareness to my table was remarkable, my chip basket was never empty! Thumbs up!!! :) 

Amongst a menu full of great food, my top recommendations are: The Molcajete, Sopes or Ceviche Tostada. 

Overall, if you want a great meal and a positive experience to go with it, Los Agaves is the place to be."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Wow!  What a find.  We were driving up from LA to Nor Cal and looked on Yelp for a good Mexican restaurant in Goleta to stop for dinner.  Los Agaves came up at the top of the list, but I must admit to being skeptical when we saw that it was in a shopping center and that you have to order at the counter.  One look at the food and we quickly got over that.  We settled into one of their outdoor tables and had a wonderful meal.

I went for the house specialty Molcajetes Sea and Earth.  It comes out sizzling in a black lava bowl and tastes as good as it looks.  Simply one of the most unique and best Mexican dishes I have ever tried.  My wife and daughter loved their meals as well and everything we saw looked great."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I have always been a huge fan of Los Agaves!  My love for the restaurant started at Milpas, then included De La Vina, and now Goleta is in the mix!
I'm not much of a Yelper, but I have to admit that I do jump on it sometimes after I go to a great restaurant just to see if they are fairly treated by customers. (Most of the time, they are not.)
I have to point out the one star comments for Los Agaves.  Check out the user profiles and other reviews posted by these people before you believe them.  They love to hate. (Okay, I do have one bad review on my list.)
Trust the 5 stars, because this place is definitely worth the visit.
Los Agaves Enchiladas for life!!!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Los Agaves is a great place to get authentic Mexican food that tastes and looks good on the plate. Molcajete is my favorite dish, is light and full of flavor, of course if you eat the three hand made tortillas that come with it, there goes the lightness of the dish.  I have also tried other dishes and overall Los Agaves has always satisfied my cravings for decent Mexican food, outside my own kitchen. I am Mexican and enjoy cooking and eating good Mexican food, I recommend this place to any one who is looking for a good Mexican restaurant with reasonable prices!  Buen apetito!!!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Los Agaves is definitely one of the best Mexican food places in Santa Barbara. Great atmosphere and delicious food. The service is relatively quick for being typically always busy. The appetizer nachos feeds 2-3 people comfortably. I highly recommend the shrimp tacos del mar. It also comes with sides of Mexican rice and a Los agaves salad which is amazing.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Appear smaller than the downtown SB we normally dine, yet as cozy, comfy, and quick enough to order then enjoy our meal. Attended daughter's PCN @UCSB that evening so you can imagine how busy this Los Agaves in Goleta were --spent 10 mins in line.  Counter girl talked me into ordering an Anaheim Poblano combination instead of 3 sopes ala carte. Person with me did not say a word bcoz she was too busy cleaning up her plate. The rest of our table raved about the plate presentation of each meal. Meantime, daughter's table couldn't finish their meals due of the amount they ordered. All servers coming by were courteous to continue asking if we need anything else while also removing empty plates. Because this Los Agaves is situated in a mall area, there were plenty of parking. It was difficult to find faults from the place and almost left a perfect '5 stars' before posting when I remembered I was asked not to take out beer at hand - -bummer, had to stand 10 feet away from our table. Because of the beer thing, I'm leaving Los Agaves, Goleta a 4.5.

Oh wait, there is no such half-a-point. rating. This time, because I love the crew, the food, and my company, I'm Ieaving `em a five : )"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Great food, decent price, busy. It's fast food. If the food were not quite so heavy we might dine here more often."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,This place has amazing food. I've been here a few times and I'm never disappointed. The portions are pretty big for what you're paying. You get free chips and salsa whether you eat in or take it to go. The friends that I've recommended this place to have loved it as well.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I've been to the Santa Barbara location several times and love their Carne Azteca meal.  Loved it here, too!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"The nachos were O.K, but I rather would of had shrimp alambre and mango margarita2nd time in a roll they run out of shrimp, chile rellenos and Margaritassomeone please tell the owner."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"The Goleta location manager Enrique is just precious. He's a Good man. Great food, good service!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"After a quick yelp search, I stumbled across this restaurant & i'm super glad that i did. Everything from the presentation of our food to the customer service that we received was spectacular! 

For food, my boyfriend & I decided on the burrito mojado and a combination plate with a chicken enchilada & a chile rellano. Ridiculously big portions with a whole lot of flavor. They also have a self serve salsa bar with many options to choose from! & a worker will bring you a basket of chips which is unlimited. To top it off, there's ample amount of parking & the restaurant is dog friendly. Will definitely be back for more (:"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Throw your shame out the window and lick the plate.  As with their other locations, Los Agaves is hands down the best Mexican food in town.  Add in their casual dining room and reasonable prices and it's hard to eat anywhere else.  Having them nearby as a work-week lunch option is going to wreak havoc on my waistline!  Seems like they're still working a few of the kinks out at the new location, but I'm sure they'll be up to par in no time."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I will admit I am a fan of Los Agaves and have eaten now at all three locations, Milpas, de la Vina, and now Goleta and I think the thing that they do well that few restaurants with multiple locations do well, is consistency. The food is excellent at all three locations and basically tastes the same. I had enchiladas with green sauce (I forget the exact name), and they were fabulous. Plus I cannot get enough of their guacamole. So perfectly seasoned and zingy. As the British say, 'moreish'. 

Unlike other early reviewers, I did not have any problems with the service when I went. It was around noon on a weekday, and definitely busy. Though there were no tables when we ordered, one soon became available, and we sat down about 5 minutes before our food arrived-- perfect! 

I'm glad this restaurant is expanding - the staff work really hard and the food is reasonably priced and consistently delicious. I recommend this for anybody living in or visiting SB!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,i love this place !! they serve amazingly delicious mexican dishes !!! its a bit on the pricey side but its honestly worth every penny because their portions are enormous ! your entree is served with a free basket of freshly fried tortilla chips. theres a self serve salsa bar which is super convenient. i usually get the los agaves burrito ! the chipotle sauce they drench the burrito with is amazing ad the shrimp & fish inside is always yummy and fresh !
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Delicious!!!! This was my first time at this particular Los Agaves location and the food and ambience was just as fabulous as ever!  I've previously been to the Westlake Village location a number of times and Los Agaves is one of my favorite restaurants.  The molcajete (arrachera) and queso fundido are my go-to favorites... every item I've tried here is great though so there's really no wrong decision you can make.  Their salsa bar is one of the best, if not the best, I've experienced and the staff is always super pleasant and provide great service.  I'll be back!  Now, if only they could do me a huge favor and open a location in Austin, TX *hint hint*"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"The food here is consistently good. I like to order the combo plate (rice and beans included) with three items -- chile relleno, crispy taco with beef, and a chicken sope. The rellenos are absolutely delicious with an amazing batter and tomato based sauce drizzled on top. For $14, this is a really good deal. They also have a delicious breakfast -- I had the huevos rancheros omelette and was very satisfied. Unlike other breakfast places, the food was not at all greasy. Lastly, they have the best self-serve salsa bar in town; there is something for everybody here. Tip: they are very busy on Thursday-Saturday evenings. Order takeout or be prepared to wait in a ten minute line and then find seats."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Normally love this place, but DO NOT ORDER TAKE-OUT! One of two orders ( two 2 item combos) was wrong and our chile rellenos tasted like dish soap -- this is not an exaggeration, we both spat out our bites of relleno. I called to speak with the manager (and was disconnected after five minutes) who eventually deducted the price of the rellenos from the bill. That was appreciated but, in my opinion, the whole meal should have been free since one order was completely wrong and the entire thing was inedible due to the lasting taste of soap in our mouths. We come here at least once a week, usually for breakfast on Sundays as well, but are disappointed to lose this place as a dinner spot. We will absolutely not be returning. People can get sick from ingesting soap of any kind -- it is highly toxic."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Omg I was so happy when I found out they had a location in Goleta. This is the only place I eat at when I'm in Santa Barbara or traveling through. My favorite is the Los Agaves burrito. It has fresh fish and shrimp and amazing sauce inside and on top. The sale is like dessert with an amazing mango dressing.  My husband had the fish tacos and they were amazing as well. What sets their food apart is the freshness of all the ingredients.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"If you like quality Mexican food presented in the form of the most exquisite art pieces known to man kind, then Los agaves is the place to go. They will customize your order to however you please, not to mention the ever changing specialty menu that provides something new for the weekly regular like myself. Management goes the extra 2 miles to make sure everything is presented in the most fleekly manor. My personal favorite is the chimichanga drenched in the enchilada sauce. Pure bliss."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Always very good food, quick service, nice outside seating.  Nothing fancy but good consistent food.   The rice and beans are even very good!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Food is decent at best and expect to wait a little over an hour for your food. Not the best place to take the family out for dinner or to go out on a date . Additionally I was very disappointed with the customer service ; I waited 30 minutes for my food and when I brought it to the managers attention he said they were barely going to start my order. Mind you there was about 20 people at the restaurant. Principally, spend your money elsewhere"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Came in a few weeks ago with a friend. Place was busy and it's a seat-yourself kind of deal. Anyways, when our food came out they had mixed up our order. Sent it back, and when the second round of burritos came out, one was cold and one had cheese (when we asked for none). Sent it back again (after asking ourselves if it was worth it), got the correct and yummy burritos, and the manager sent over a dessert and an apology. 

Moral of the story: mistakes happen in restaurants, especially when they are busy. I get that. The manager was SUPER nice about it all and made sure we were happy at the end. And the service was so fast that by the time we had the right food, it was at the normal wait time for any other restaurant!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Solid upscale Mexican restaurant. When it's dinner time, the line is out the door. 

My go to is the Burrito Del Mar. I wish you could get the chipotle sauce on top at the salsa bar because it is 5 times better than their salsa there. 

Fajitas are great too. Usually more food than I can eat!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Bold flavors, fresh ingredients, fast moving lines in this popular place and service that honestly wants to please. What's not to like about Los agaves? The menu is great, and the specials are where it's at. This is quite a departure from the typical tired, boring, stuck in the 1980's Mexican restaurants that are too commonly found in Ca. I highly recommend this place. Thanks for opening this new location closer to me."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"If you want an authentic and fresh lunch or dinner, Los Agaves is the place for you.  Newly remodeled, which opens up the space is bright and family friendly.  I had the pineapple and shrimp dish which came with rice and a spring mix salad with a homemade dressing.  We live in San Luis Obispo and this place is almost worth a drive just to eat here.  The parking is always  ""interesting"" so go early!!  Love this place and super fast service with free salsas."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,This is our go to place for Mexican food in Goleta.  Great selection Of food and drinks.  They have good tacos on Taco Tuesday and other specials throughout the week.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Great find in Goleta near IV.  Food is fresh and tasty.   Great salsa bar.    I had the Agaves Burrito with halibut and shrimp, roasted red peppers, onions, Monterey Jack cheese, lettuce and guacamole topped with chipotle sauce. Served with rice and house salad.   It was awesome!   They give you a number and deliver to your table.   The staff was awesome, friendly and helpful.   It was busy and staff was working their tail off to clear tables and deliver orders.    It was fast causal dining; but was the food was high end sit down tasty.  Some mex food is bland; this was super satisfying and flavorful."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"This is our 3rd time back since they opened.  Food is great!  BUT they really need to have more than one register taking orders.  We are in a line that will take 20 mins to get our order in.  Will stop coming except in off hours until they fix.
SPOKE TOO SOON:). They now have two registers.  Just goes really slow.  Still advise people to stay away during busy times."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"The best!! Love the Alambres and Agaves Burrito from here. Find a table and have someone else order for you because it gets a little crazy.

Beer deal on Tuesday is not super well known but a great chance to get a draft Hoppy Poppy for a sweet price! ($2.50 at time of this review)"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Great food and service. best wet burrito I have ever had. Burrito mojado was very good. I highly recommend it. Complimentary chips and salsa was great too!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Some of the best Mexican food this city has to offer!  Super friendly staff who always accommodates any needs that we have. Our family visits one of their locations multiple times a month. Great menu selection and fantastic salsa bar and chips!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"The tortilla soup hit the spot! I'd like to think I'm a tortilla soup pro but this was like none I've ever tasted before! A rich creamy red sauce, with panela  cheese and loads of chicken is heaven on earth! Most places can be pretty cheap with the chicken but not here !!! :) hit the spot on this rainy day"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,Terrible service. I waited A little under an hour and they still had not prepared my order. Never going back
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Great place here for Mexican food. I got the Shrimp Diablo - Spicey as heck but Dayom good. The nachos and salsa is set aside at the nacho bar which is nice for refills. Large quantities on the plate, yummy but prepare for big calories ingestion."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,Ordered the usually super good chicken fajita burrito. I can't eat beans so I asked for no beans in it but there were beans and I took it to go. Huge bummer because this wasn't the first time it happened but last time I ate there so they whipped me up another without beans.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Our favor Mexican in Santa Barbara. Not cheap but good portions and very good quality. Ceviche is some of the best we've tasted. Tanpiqena, Fajitas, Molcajete, and Nachos arevsome of our favorites."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I've now been to all 3 SB locations and the food is amazing every time!  Don't be discouraged by the long lines...it's totally worth the wait.  

My favorite items are the Chile Nortenos and Agaves Enchiladas.  The house salad is delicious with fresh greens and a mango salsa.  The pinto beans are delecious and I always substitute beans for rice.  Also, there is a dark roasted salsa that is the best salsa in all of Santa Barbara."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I can't say enough about how wonderful their customer service is. Today during lunch I had an issue with my food, and even though I had ate half of one of the items the waitress took the plate and brought me a whole new one out. She then checked on me again to make sure I didn't have the same issue, I was very impressed. 

Their quality of food is always awesome! Their agaves enchiladas are amazing! If you are a seafood type of person I definitely recommend them. I had their arrachera last week and the meat quality was excellent, and the homemade tortillas gave the meal that extra touch, I also recommend it.

If you are looking for good quality Mexican food at a reasonable price this is one of the top places in SB/Goleta to check out."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"I was hoping for more. We ordered multiple different dishes and everything was just ok. Nothing special, but decent Mexican food."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"I love the food here, very fast service and the patio seating is amazing! I'm a satisfied customer every time."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,easily the best mexican food place in sb. the burrito mojado with chicken is a must have. and their taco tuesday is good too
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Food is pretty good. A little pricey. One star for forgetting my order even though they use numbers, which means if i still have my number then my food hasn't came yet. Pretty inexcusable. The waitresses working seemed pretty indifferent."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Great service and great food! Love the Los Agaves Salad with grilled chicken. The salsa bar is awesome too.
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Los Agaves in Goleta is always my mexican craving go to! A coworker ordered catering for an office party awhile back and I've been hooked since then. The food is absolutely ravishing and consistently delivers to meet those cravings. I never eat beans,but los agaves has a secret ingredient (thinking chorizo and cheese?? I've introduced several people to this hidden gem,and they've all fallen in love! 
The staff are always super friendly, courteous, speedy and kind. They also are very helpful with swapping out ingredients or side substitutions. Can't wait to work my way thru the menu to find my favorite!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,One thing I definitely miss about Santa Barbara is Los Agaves. I've only had their vegetarian burrito and it was sooo good. Like literally so good. They also have a good selection of salsas. My favorite was the avocado based one!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"absolutely disgusting. Ordered the Queso Fundido, and it showed up as a solid glob of melted oily cheese (had to use a knife to even eat any of it).  Also order the Plato Placero de Arrachera, and the melted cheese was also just a melted glob with a 1/2 of a chorizo link stuck on top, and the nopal was under cooked and slimy. The chicken they sent with it was super dry and cold. never again."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"The two Los Agaves restaurants on Milpas and De La Vina have been quite satisfying. When a third one opened in Goleta, I was thrilled as it did not require me to drive 15 min on the freeway. But I have had enough of its less than mediocre fare, and will no longer go to this location. The Chile Verde burrito, which is so great at the Santa Barbara locations, is dull with too much bean and cheese goop and too little sauce. The molcajetes used to be decent, but I could not go beyond a few spoonfuls today. And the Chile Relleno was--um--disgusting. They should try the one served at Los Arroyos and learn how to make a decent one."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Pros
Quick service 
Great environment
Good food flavor

Cons
Food was cold 
Chips cold
Not handicap friendly."
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,Sooooooo good! One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in sb and also I love their salsas!
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,positive,"Plentiful platters of aesthetically pleasing, flavorful yet healthy-seeming California Mexican food.

Casual order at counter, salsa bar, indoor and outdoor seats and young helpful staff in a lovely but busy Spanish courtyard-styled outdoor mall.

Last night a group of us were barely able to finish our meals because we overate chips n salsa so go easy on them!"
PNVbv2kyUIHeJTDPis2gRg,Los Agaves,Mexican,negative,"Spent $23 on 2 tiny salmon tacos that show up plane jane with some rice, side salad and drink. The michelada tasted like bananas, literally. You have to get your own table wear to eat with and Salsa yet you're paying staff served dining prices. Flimsy tacos. No beans came with the dish. Insulting overall experience."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We LOVE Sandbar.  We would eat here every trip to Santa Barbara...actually, I think we do....How has it taken me so long to write a review??

I'm sure their entire menu is delicious, but we tend to stick with the same items because we love them SOOO much!!

The Nachos.  Somehow, these are the best nachos I think we've ever eaten.  The cheese is perfect, the right amount of toppings, the beans are perfect - amazing.

Hubby and I split a burrito this trip because we weren't famished, and the burritos are HUGE.  We split the Supreme Burrito.  I usually get chicken, but hubby ordered carne asada and it was, as expected, delicious.  Served on a giant plate with rice and beans and salsa, we could barely finish our halves.  

Happy Hour is always a great deal - the current special is (in addition to select $5 mixed drinks), buy (select) drinks (call, well, some beers) and get a second for a quarter! Hubby enjoyed two whiskey-cokes, and we both enjoyed sitting on the patio and watching the State Street traffic.

Always a pleasure - thank you, Sandbar!

**Also - in the past, we've sat and enjoyed drinks and appetizers while watching games!  Lots of TV's if you need 'em!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"As a UCSB alum, I frequented Sandbar quite a bit during my college haydays.  It's always a great place to start out College Night downtown on Thursday with a more relaxed atmosphere and 2-for-1 drink specials can't be turned down!  

In general the scene at night, is mostly young 20-somethings having a few drinks before heading on to EOS, Wildcat or some other bigger dance spot.  The vibe is relaxed and it can get rather crowded but they have a bar in the back that helps alleviate the crowding.

But the true GEM of Sandbar is their WEEKEND BREAKFAST SPECIAL!!!!!!!!!!   it goes from open to I think about 10 or 11 am and is awesome.  It's a simple eggs, sausage or bacon, toast, and pancakes or rice and beans breakfast that fills you up and tastes pretty damn good too. And guess what it is only $3.99!!!!! tasty and affordable... a rarity in dt sb at times.  But the best part is that it comes with $1 drinks!!!! You can choose from mimosas, bloody marys(which are very well made), bellinis, etc.  So it's a perfect way to start a weekend without dropping $20 on a fancy unlimited champagne brunch!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We had a great experience at Sandbar. It was a perfect spot for a bite and cocktail on happy hour. Ryan was really helpful and patient with us. We had a very large group and he continued to check on us to make sure everything was to our liking and we didn't need anything else. Happy Hour for drinks was an excellent deal- one drink normal, one for a quarter. And a whole list of food options for half price! Definitely a spot to stop in when you're here(:"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,This is a cool spot to grab a drink and chill outside to people watch. The drinks are good and the service is friendly. This is one of my regular spots when I am in Santa Barbara.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I'm not from around here and there are lots of options for food and drink, but after checking photos on yelp decided to go here. Had the happy hour taquitos, they were so good. Margarita is strong. And bartenders are attentive and talkative and friendly. Chips and salsa are good more of a chipotle/chili flavor which I don't care for but still good."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good food, good drinks, cool atmosphere. The drinks aren't very strong and the food definitely isn't authentic, but it's still delicious. It's. Great outdoor dining experience"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place is nice, right in the middle of a busy street and the service was good. The place is extremely crowded and you can barely get in and out of the chairs! They are super close together. The food was mediocre ""Mexican"" food. I am from southern Cal so I might be a harsh critic on Authentic Mexican food. But the guacamole was good, and the salsa was just tomato sauce. We ordered shrimp tacos and the shrimp was good, although there was just too much on the taco."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"What a great way to start off a day in Santa Barbara!

Sandbar is everything you want in a coastal bar. The set up is outdoor with plenty of shade spots and flat screen TVs in all the right places. Great apps and awesome fresh margaritas. 

Do not order the Bloody Mary. One of the worst I've ever had.

Weather was perfect when I was there. I will be back and try it out at night next time."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"went there a year ago about and it was the best place i had gone. went there recently and was not sure how it ever made a impact. bar is pretty cool to grab a drink i'd give that 5 stars but to grab some grub it was basic, nachos was something i could of made myself, chicken burrito with rice and beans i ordered looked like oatmeal when i cut it open. i just look for something better in food when i pay twice as much to make it myself. 74 degrees outside and the heaters were blasting which could have just been an accident. food really killed it, should of gotten drunk first. waiters and waitresses were friendly and cool though."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Loooove their chips and salsa, they have huge water and soda cups, amazing virgin frozen margaritas, and the best Chile rellenos and hard tacos."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Really good Mexican food and great place to hang out with friends... Too bad they don't have one in the LA area.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Fajitas and burritos were fantastic. Our waiter was in training so I understand that our drinks were late, but still very good service. Good outside seating with a fire built into the table."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I am writing this review of a  Sunday lunch, so no commentary of this place as a night spot, but I bet it swings.

We arrived on a busy Sunday for lunch, and the wait wasn't too bad, only about 15-20 minutes for a party of four persons.

Happily we were seated outside on the patio to enjoy the SB air and a good spot for people watching up and down State Street.

Casey ou server was prompt and let us enjoy some chips and salsa while awaiting the final persons in our party.  This place is definitely DOG friendly as there were several guest with their four-pawed friends camped out on the floor or in laps.

The Perfect Margarita was made well, said it is fresh squeezed lime juice.  

Our lunches included a combination plate, of which the poblano pepper was nice and fresh.  Also ordered were chicken enchiladas covered in a tasty mole sauce, regular chicken enchiladas and finally a cheeseburger.  

All were very good.  The service was attentive.  I hope the Sandbar continues to thrive.  It's a good spot."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This afternoon, I went someplace else other than the Andersen's Bakery. ( They were closed for annual vacation. Big sobs.) This place is right next to the parking lot. Plus, Mexican sounded good. This place has an exotic decor with a lovely patio. ( There weren't even tons of insects roaming about.) All of three of us kept it simple with tacos, beans and rice. We loved our meal. It was filling, hot and well-seasoned. 

I'd come back."

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"My boyfriend, his father, and his father's friends were in town for the SB Fiestas a few weeks ago. I suggested Sandbar since it usually serves decent margaritas. I brought in almost 10 people with a $20 cover charge each, and we purchased numerous drinks and appetizers. Despite my party being great customers, one of the managers and a few staff members decided my boyfriend was ""stumbling around and slurring his words"" after he returned from a bathroom break with his father. I can honestly think of no other reason they felt the need to kick him out other than his appearance. He is tall, brown, and has a beard. My boyfriend and I are in are early 20s but the rest our party was 40+, his father is 60+ years old, we were not excessive, no one was blacked out or acting inappropriately, we were just trying to show his father and friends a good time. Unfortunately, the staff and manager verbally harassed my boyfriend and his father with absolutely no proof or reason for doing so. 


TL;DR
Some of the male security staff and the male-tall-skinny manager are racist, sexist, fools. The waitresses are rude. Everything is over-priced. Do not waste your time at such a disgusting establishment.

0/10 I will never return to Sandbar and neither will any of my friends."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,This place is great if you want to drink without cover downtown. Food is okay. It's the kind of place that's trying to be upscale and a Cabo Cantina at the same time.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Came here for a bachelorette party. If it's your ACTUAL birthday, you get a complimentary blowjob shot.

Drinks were alright. Music was meh, but I had loads of fun here. It's a really lively bar and does get really crowded. The bartender the first night, Friday night, kory, told us to give him a call on Saturday night cause he would hook us up with a bottle of champagne. We came back Saturday night, we met up with kory, he did not give us the bottle of champagne (-1 star). But this place was really fun either way. A bunch of college students come here and they were really creepy, asking us to go back to their beach house. They kept trying to take my friends drinks...super weird (-1 star). 

I'd come back again though"

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"After many visits to the Sandbar, the last visit might be the last. Last week my husband and I went with our two friends. They have a two year old and so do we. Has we drove by the restaurant we noticed there was a couple with a stroller eating at the restaurant. One of our kids was asleep so we decided to take the stroller with the sleeping child in it. 

     Once we got to the front the hostess informed us that we would have to fold the stroller and put it in a designated stroller area because we couldn't take it in the restaurant (we agreed to it) we completely understand.  What we didn't understand is why there was somebody else already sitting there with a stroller open. We didn't question it. Clair, (the hostess) asked how many people were in our party. It was a total of four adults and two children. Clair asked us if we wanted to sit in the high chairs or low ones. We requested the low ones. She gave us a look and asked someone else if that would be possible. What came out of her mouth next is ridiculous! Clair said ""But the kids have to sit on a chair they can't be held because it's a hazard"".  Clair, you clearly have much to learn in the world of customer service  and better yet in life!

     I contact the restaurant to file a formal complain. I spoke to one of the supervisors who apologized and said Clair was one of the newer employees. The supervisor took my name and number and assure me that the manager would contact me no later than the next day. Well it has now been three days later and I'm still waiting. 

     To an extent my party and I felt like Clair didn't want us to eat at the restaurant. I'm not sure what it is she was basing her hostility at? Was it the fact we had children with us (at 3 in the afternoon) or was it the way we looked? It's unfortunate that they have an employee of that sort has the first line of contact with the clients. With that said with so many options of restaurants on state street the Sandbar will definitely not be on our list.

     Update to my original review: Aaron, the owner contact me yesterday but I wasn't able to call him back until today. I spoke to Aaron for a few minutes and I do feel that he was sincere and actually cared about my experience at the Sandbar.  He did apologize and explain the situation with the stroller issues and the chairs also. He was very professional and overall has convinced me to return to the Sandbar.  

     During our conversation with Aaron he did make me realized that out of all our visits to the Sandbar this had been only one bad experience. With that said I did update my star rating from a one star to a four  From previous experience the customer service and the food have always met if not exceeded our expectations."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Sandbar is a great spot for brunch in downtown Santa Barbara. On weekends they have a breakfast drink menu that are buy one get one for quarter. It's a great breakfast spot. Nice on ambience and pretty good service. I recommend the breakfast quesadilla and the French toast was also amazing.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We came here the other night after a wedding reception (bride and groom wanted to partyyyyy) and had a wonderful time- courtesy of Brandon Stilwill. We were a fairly large and obnoxious group but we had a wonderful time dancing- the music was great, the drinks were good, and we ordered a decent amount of food (nachos, etc) which were yummy! If I'm ever in SB again this is a good choice for a fun night out :)"

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Stopped by for a quick drink on a Sunday night for President's Day weekend. I didn't stick around long so I can't give much of a review other than to say that the service was pretty slow, outside seating is pretty cool, it is pretty loud inside, there was a cover charge to get in (which I don't mind if it keeps the rascals out), and the pizza place across the street is pretty awesome (for a quick bite after Sandbar)."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Atmosphere was very chill , I wish I had a Dodger game to watch at the time. Outside a cool Bon fire to sit around and have drinks/appetizers."

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Cool spot, definitely in the patio area!  Good food and great service!  Our server was a total Megan Fox look alike - hotness!!  She was really cool!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place is a dump! The food is anything BUT Mexican. In fact, when I ordered carnitas soft tacos, I got carne asada instead. When I told the waitress that I ordered carnitas, she replied ""Yeah, it should be in there!"" WTF!?! That means pork sweetheart, not beef! And, I've had better margaritas out of a can. It was weak and watered down. Even if it is a happy hour special, I should at least taste tequila. Save your money and go elsewhere!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The only good thing about this bar is the location. The food is terrible and the service is very slow for making greasy fried food.  I have been extremely sick twice after eating their ""mexican food"". The manager is so rude, the only consistent business they have is tourists and drunk college kids who don't know better. Our servers name was Daniel,
who would be fired if I owned the business, extremely unprofessional and discourteous. Is it so hard to treat each guest with a little respect?  You'd think the owner or GM would crack down on the poor service and food... Please 

Save your money or go elsewhere...Do not come here!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"there was a time when sandbar was just a bar and night spot. I figure the owner(s) realized that the overhead was too high and had to operate during the day and here they are today. it's very chili's esque and the food is OK.  you wouldn't know it by looking inside.  it is always crowded and its because they catch donkey tourists looking for a place to lounge and it's hard to say no with patio seating and a hot hostess.

To their credit, they have a really good happy hour and its probably the best value since you wouldn't want to pay full price for their food.

As a nightclub, sandbar is an awesome spot to hangout. they create a welcoming atmosphere with the heating lamps but it is a shame they charge to get in at night."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I'm a fan. This is my type of place. You have the open patio but you could still see the basketball games on the flatscreens inside if you choose. There is a guy jammin' on a guitar in the covered dance area. The place is packed with people who are out having a good time. There are 2x1 drinks and the food is good- I had the carne asada plate. We were looking for a relaxed afternoon outside where we could have some drinks and food in a cool atmosphere. We found it!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Food is absolutely delicio.  Shrimp casadia and beef nacos are super. Pomegranate mojito is just what was needed. Love it.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The Sandbar is one of the most fun nightclubs and restaurants to party at on lower State St.

The food is delicious and offers an extensive variety to satisfy all Mexican-food cravings. Portions can't be beat and the prices are good too; half-off appetizers and 2 for 1 drink specials at every happy-hour, and even more unique specials nearly every day of the week!

I've read some poor reviews about the restaurant's staff here on Yelp!, and I must disagree. I've become great friends with the staff there, and I'm convinced that these ladies and gents are always working their hardest to make the customer's experience better. The restaurant can get VERY busy at times, especially later evenings (after 9:30pm), so please have patience with the waiters and waitresses. But when it comes down to it, the Sandbar team is always looking out for YOU. 

It's best selling point? The night life. The Sandbar has exceptional live band performances (especially note-worthy are Reggae Tuesdays). Thursday nights and the weekends are packed from wall-to-wall, with everyone moving to the beats of many incredible DJ's. Keep an eye out for special events; The Sandbar throws some incredible parties with hilarious and fun themes.

Definitely a place to party all night, start the night, or end the night. Just make sure you stop in at The Sandbar at some point in the night! You will NOT be disappointed."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"It pains me to have to rate this so low but I just received a ""Birthday Welcome Dinner"" and was going to meet a group of friends for my birthday this Saturday afternoon but since you have so many rules and my birthday can ONLY be celebrated on a Sun - Thursday, we are passing.I recently went here with a girlfriend - all the way from Oak Park - and was eating in the front bar area and was told that 3 appetizers and drinks was not acceptable and that we could only sit on the ""benches"" if we were eating lunch otherwise we had to move to the bar. The tab still came to $50.00+ and even though we ordered, we got our food to go and left rather than be seen moving from an area that was most definitely designed for a bar atmosphere not dining. To be told AFTER we ordered and received the food to order lunch was inconceivable. 
Bottom line: They have too many rules, they took the fun and pleasure of going there and our previous party of 14 upstairs which was our annual gathering I assure you will not be at that restaurant in the future. There are many restaurants in Santa Barbara (with less rules and more fun)."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ate on their patio and had the fish tacos and raspberry lemonade. Food and service was great but their orange couches on the patio are in dire need of replacing. They were super dirty, ripped everywhere and taped in many spots, they were also wayyy too low for the tables also you're eating like a toddler. Other than the patio couches, everything was great. New couches."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,DJ Spark is legit and keeps up with the current scene. Mixing is onpoint. Great person and willing to take request. Drinks are decent.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Forgot to yelp this place! I came here during Fiesta weekend on my visit to SB. 
Sad...I had to pay cover since it was Fiesta weekend, but usually you don't have to! 

In terms of the environment, it is chill, laid back, beachy/hawaiian type of feel here. The drinks aren't that bad and there is a really great staff that go around and ask if you want another drink....instead of you having to make your way to the bar all the time. 

There is an indoor and outdoor area of this place. The outdoor is filled with chatter and people coming together having a good time. Not much dancing going on. The inside area is a bit smaller and there is music also playing. Even though there is a dance floor, not many people in SB dance... I feel like! 

Calm environment, didn't see people get too crazy here except this one chick (but she somehow got wasted on her own and came with no friends...awkward)."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Was looking for a place to eat while visiting Santa Barbara with my boyfriend. Came across this place and I must say it was great. Aesthetically wise, it's appealing. Many chances for great photos and he way it's set up has a really cool vibe to it. Waitresses are nice. Were attentive and the food itself was delicious. I got the chicken machaca crispy taco and the cheese enchilada combo and I truly enjoyed it. My boyfriend got the grilled asada burrito and it was huge. He usually eats a lot but he got super full on just the burrito. We didn't get any alcoholic beverages but looking around me , many of their margaritas looked to die for. Would come again 10/10"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We arrived at Sandbar parched and starving.  The hostess seated immediately upon arrival and promptly served us with ice water and an ample amounts of chips. Our god given gift of a server, Cassie, took our order the moment we were ready and made amazing recommendations. The service was beyond spectacular and before we knew it, the best dining experience of our young lives ensued. I ordered the fajitas del mar and might I say, they surely lived up to Cassie's stellar recommendation. My friend ordered the burger (in a Mexican restaurant) and said it was the best burger she's ever had in America. This glorious restaurant even made a bean and cheese burrito a delectable dish. Bottom line, food was beyond incredible and Cassie's serving was so great it's indescribable."

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Went here this past Saturday for a bachelorette party and could not have had a better experience! My group of 7 girls was looking around for a place grab dinner and drinks and everywhere was at least an hour. We inquired about the wait time here, which was also an hour long, but the hostess told us that a party of 8 had not showed up and that we could take their reservation. We were seated immediately! The drinks were great, food was decent and prices were very reasonable. The best part of our experience was the above and beyond service. In just mentioning that we were a bit chilly, management turned on heaters that helped a lot! Our waitress noticed that we were looking for batteries for our cameraand actually went out of her way to find some and bring them to us, just because she was nice! When we inquired about somewhere to go dancing, we found out that the place turned into a nightclub with two dance floors and seating if you order bottle service. They brought us a ""girls night out"" menu where all the drinks and bottles were 50% off (we ordered a bottle of grey goose for $125, a steal for us since we're from LA). There were douchey guys but we didn't have to deal with them too much since we had elevated seating. Oh and our bride forgot her bride to be sash at the hotel but the guy who arranged our bottle service found her a tiara to wear for the night. 

All in all, this place place was the icing on the cake to what was an amazing bachelorette party! I am so grateful to the staff for being so amazing, they made this an unforgettable experience!"

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I have been going here for the past 4 yrs when I am on vacation. It is my first stop when I get to Santa Barbara and it is my last stop. Heather has been my waitress every time is she is amazing. So sweet and helpful and attentive. I love their bloody mary's and they have the best breakfast in town. Football is the best to watch there and I have to say I have spent the whole day there eating breakfast, watching football, then inside for lunch.... Crazy but this is my favorite place to eat when I am in Santa Barbara. The outside seating is so relaxing in the morning and the sun feels so good there that it is my favorite part of vacation when I see Heather walk up to my table. I don't think she really remembers me but she acts like she does and I see her at least 3 times during my weeks stay in Santa Barbara. I love love love this place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I have been here twice, the first time was back in spring and the second time just this past weekend. Their food, drinks, and service is really good. Their enchiladas are probably my favorite, I can say they're close to being authentic. Their chile rellenos have good flavor but need more red sauce for my taste. The burritos are huge and really tasty and every plate comes with a scoop of guacamole, rice, beans, and pico de gallo. Their drinks specials are also really good! I have some of the best blended margaritas here at Sandbar and their Sunday Happy Hour is great for drinks. 

Overall, if you're in Santa Barbara and you're craving Mexican food or just want to drink....definitely come to the Sandbar."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Nice place. Great service. Awesome margarita!!!! It is my second time at this restaurant. I will definitely come back ))))
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Fun atmosphere with cool art on the walls. Good food. Weak drinks but they have a lot of great drink deals where you get 2 for 1 so it equals out. The service here is really hit or miss. Sometimes they are wonderful, they bring out the chips and salsa and will frequently stop by to see if you need anything. Other times they will almost completely ignore you. The guy servers are generally a million times better than the female servers here I noticed. If you want good fast service, eat in the bar area."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"As far as bars go, this is one of the best in town. We came for happy hour and found a seat at the bar where we were helped by Andrew. He made sure we knew exactly what was going on as far as drink and food specials and even offered up some great recommendations! The perfect margarita was fantastic! Drinks are great, appetizers were yummy, and the service was fast and friendly! We'll definitely be coming back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This is now our third visit to Santa Barbara in three months. Today we stopped in the Sandbar for breakfast. They have a great deal for $5.50. I posted a picture of what they offer. We were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress was wonderful she informed us of our options for breakfast and took out order right away. The food came out fast and hot. The Sandbar looks to be a fun place. The football game is on but not overwhelming, we can still have conversation without yelling. I give this place 5 stars because it's clean, great service and wow good food. Stop by on your next visit to SB and tell them Mike sent you. They may look with crossed eyes but tell them anyway."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"It was Saturday night and we were bachelorette party of 10 girls; our reservation for another restaurant was booked on open table and when we arrived the restaurant was closed for renovations. So we walked down the street and tried to find a table big enough for all of us. Blush a near by restaurant recommended Sandbar and we were more than happy to wait in the bar area for them to get a table for us. The bar area had really nice seating and fire pits. Once we were seated our waiter Arthur was great! He was super accommodating for my particular food allergy, the portions were large and the prices were more than reasonable. We were treated wonderfully for a large group without a reservation."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Hey, you're going to the Sandbar for lunch/dinner, huh?  What would I recommend there?  I'd recommend you eating somewhere else.  It's not really awful, but it's not like..too good either.  I don't know.  There's just something bland and whatever about the food.  

It's sort of that type of thing where someone says,  Hey, what did you have for lunch yesterday and then you think about it and you go  ""you know, I don't even remember""  That's the sandbar's food. 

The margaritas are generally good but not for the price.  They're probably better than margaritas anywhere else on State Street.  Overall though, I find drinks on state street to be both pricey and lovelessly distributed.

If you're hitting the bars/clubs later in the evening, definately dont eat at the Sandbar.  You're going to be burping and hiccuping mediocre mexican all night and it's gonna just make you that much grosser to the sweet ladies.

I say good day!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Not really sure how to rate our experience here. The staff was very confused and our waitress said that she was from another restaurant, that explained her lack of knowledge of the menu. We noticed that all of the staff had different restaurant shirts/tanks on and seemed very flustered. We ordered drinks, horribly weak and absolutely lacking any flavor. We sent them back and the waitress informed us that the bartender was also not familiar with the drink menu. So it felt a lot like the blind leading the blind. Our service was incredibly slow. Food came out incorrect. My husbands meal was something entirely different from what he ordered. They sent it back and then the corrected meal still was incorrect. At this point we had given up on the service. The food was good. Not really sure what was going on with the staff that evening. It almost seemed like the employees went on strike and staff from other restaurants were brought in."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I found this place on Yelp as I was visiting Santa Barbara from LA.  I generally recommend this place, but the service is off and on.  We came for dinner around 5pm and the hostesses were confusing and our waitress was not around too often, though it was very busy.  The people there are really chill and my group ended up striking a great conversation with some locals.  I like the 2 for 1 happy hour drink special too.  The margaritas were pretty good for pre-mixed (just to help speed up service at the bar for happy hour), but my friend's capririnha was much better as were other freshly made drinks.  My food was okay, I had some tacos.  My friends got some burritos and those were great.  So food is good and reasonably priced compared to some other Mexican restaurants I've been to in LA, but depends on what you order.  We sat in the patio and it was pretty chill atmosphere."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Excellent service. Great food. This is a family tradition every time we come out to Santa Barbara. Grateful for this spot and for Ben with his excellent customer service. Made the whole family feel comfortable.

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Went here for Sunday brunch on an Axxess 2-for-1 deal. We ordered the Scrambled Egg burrito, Macademia nut pancakes & a side of potatoes.  Everything was great except the potatoes were not wam/hot when served.  We also got 2 raspberry mimosas (2nd one was only $0.25!) Will likely be back in the future)!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great little place to eat! Love the vibe, had great/friendly service. The fish tacos were delicious! I also had a jalapeño margarita - they get high marks all around!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Mariay represents the entire experience of family-fun- festivity!! Our niece turned 21 and Mariay created celebration for us!! We lost our home in the Thomas Fire - and Mariay created comfort for us - 
Sandbar is a good place to come for relaxation and rebuilding the soul!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place it fucking brilliant. God I miss home. I swear the second I graduate I wanna move back!! Places like the Sandbar are difficult to find up here. 

Okay so the guys in here are always like super tall (which is fab cuz I'm 5'11) and oh so very hot. It has a small dance floor, but it's always super packed, music plays almost too loud, but everyone knows how to have a fucking awesome time. Like everything else in SB half of the actual bar is outside which leaves a huge seated area for smoking and hanging out with your friends. Bartenders are usually super chill and the crazy shit they play on the tv's makes me love it even more.

LOVE IT!!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Went here for Cinco De Mayo with some friends. They had circulated a flyer advertising $5 drinks. In fine red print, however, it said ""until we are packed"". The clause was vague and the place was lit by red light bulbs which made the print nearly impossible to read. I asked the bartender and she said the price changed at 9pm, which the flyer didn't say. A friend ordered drinks after me for $5 a piece. For how much business this place does you think they would learn to be more consistent. Don't cheat your customers..."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great freindly service.  Limited menu,  but everything on the menu is good."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Our first time here and it was good. Food was great, both my husband and I loved it. Drinks as well. I got skinny cucumber basil lemonade and deluxe burger. Loved it. Staff is quick and nice despite how busy they were today. The reason i give 4 stars is because the silverware was pretty dirty so we had to ask for a plastic fork. Other than that, everything was great. Recommended."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Atmosphere and service were excellent.  Chips and fresh salsa were good too.  Food was ok.  Lots of onion.  Hubby liked it better than I did.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,We got to Sabra Barbara around 7:30 and everything was already closing! Sandbar was one of the few places still open so we went it and I was surprised with it. The margaritas were very good and on a happy hour special. We split the beef enchiladas (brisket) and a house salad. The beef was amazing! Very good.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great atmosphere here. Love the outdoor seating. Also nice to sit out there at night. 

The menu has a good selection. Really enjoyed a number of thing from the menu. They have some good buy one get ones on Sunday's as well."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Let me start off by saying I'm a Sandbar regular, but only because  the food is delicious, the ambiance is great, everyone who works there is so nice and friendly, and the drinks are good!

I come here for breakfast, lunch, happy hour, dinner, drinks, dancing, fun.. I think I frequent this place more than anywhere else on state street! I have never had anything bad here. I'm always trying something different on the menu, but some of  my favorites are the fajita salad, all the burritos, and the fish tacos (blackened).

I am always in the mood for Sandbar, the only downside is the chips (not a huge fan of those) but I usually skip them anyhow and wait for my main meal!

This place is always fun, do yourself a favor and stop by!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,We came by for dinner and me and my best friend had a great time. The food tasted  fresh and amazing. Our server Katie was really sweet and on point. She was very busy but she stayed attentive and took care of us. The manager Art checked on us and made sure our drinks were filled. I highly recommend this place!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place SUCKS for breakfast.  I decided to go here because it looked appealing from the outside, which it was, however the service sucks.  I had to tell the girl two times to bring me a mimosa.  Also, the breakfast menu was very limited and the ""Mexican style omelets"" also were a disaster.  The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because the setting was colorful and exotic.  Keep the mimosas coming!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The appetizers and salsa are good, but their service is awful.

We ordered guacamole and a shrimp quesadilla. The guac, we felt, needed salt and lemon. However, we gave it a second shot and found the second time was tastier. It improved. Maybe the first one was a bad batch? They didn't even mush the avocado? Whatever! The shrimp quesadilla, on the other hand, was prefect. It had the right amount of cheese and shrimp! It also came with a side of sour cream and guac. Yum, I recommend it.

For drinks, we ordered beer, but we felt the server killed the buzz with her waiting. The beer was nice and cold, although, one of the times the hefe was served with a lemon and not with an orange as requested.

Again, the service is terrible. Our server forgot we had placed orders several times and when we would remind her, it felt it would take another 15 minutes to get our drinks. This didn't happen one, two or three times... more like five +.

If the service was this bad off hours, I can't imagine what it's like when the place is packed!

I'll think about coming back..."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I'm all about the Happy Hour here. Buy one, get one for a quarter?! And that queso with chorizo. They have a great atmosphere for dancing too... My favorites are reggae nights on Wednesdays and going to see Art (bartender) on college nights on Thursday. He always gives the best bottle service."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"It was Sunday afternoon when we found ourselves in Santa Barbara at Sandbar... had it been any other time or day, it is doubtful we would have decided to have lunch here.

Under normal circumstances, any ""restaurant"" boasting not one, two, or three (try eight) flat screen TVs on their outdoor patio would find me hustling right by without a second glance. It's just not my scene, man.  I finished college a ""short"" while ago... and I don't plan on hanging out for 3 hours to watch ""the big game"" so there's no need for me to eat in an outdoor environment  modeled after a Best Buy.

However, we'd just spent an hour driving aimlessly around Santa Barbara because we took the State St exit a few exits early... and we were HONGRY.  So when we finally found ourselves traveling down the street in the proper direction, it didn't take long for me to agree with whatever the BF wanted for lunch. Mexican? Ok. Really? Si.
We were seated on the patio...  (awesome, bro)... and waited for our server. 

I think she must have been new. I will assume that to give her the benefit of the doubt because her service lacked. I asked for water as we sat down... and she made three trips to our table (once to drop off the BF's soda... another to drop off the sangria I ordered) spaced a good 10 minutes apart before remembering to bring me the water I asked for as soon as we sat down. The BF and I ordered quickly on her 3rd trip because we didn't want another two hours to pass before being able to hit the road to LA.  

I ordered the Fajitas del Mar - grilled tomatoes, onions, red and green bell peppers and a grilled Mahi Mahi filet served with rice, refried beans, sour cream, guac, and pico.... Their fajitas are usually served with flour tortillas but I prefer corn... so that's what I got. 

The food was aiight. My fish was juicy and flaked easily... and the tortillas were nice and warm. I didn't care for the guacamole...  I don't like runny guacamole that is prepared by the barrel load, which is how theirs tasted. Bland... and runny... like guac soup. Yuck.
 
And sadly, the sangria was the absolute WORST ever. I mean it was RANK. I don't even know why they bother to call it sangria - the only fruit in the glass was sliced red apples. The wine itself tasted old... and somewhat resembled a sweaty gym sock. It was fucking GROSS.  MY BF made a joke that I probably didn't like it because we'd just spent the better part of the weekend 45 minutes north in wine country where we'd tasted some of the best reds we've had... but no. I love sangria... and this. was. FOUL. It really did taste old... like they made the batch some time in 2006. 

Hmmm...
Did I mention the fish? It was nice. 

The BF liked the tacos he ordered. I think he was just stoked that I didn't argue when he suggested Mexican for lunch.  I LOVE Mexican food...it's my waistline, you see, that prefers when I keep the tortillas, rice, and beans to a minimum. 

Doubtful I'd go back, really. There is bound to be better in SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I consider myself a carne asada burrito connoisseur. That's pretty much all I order when dining at a fine Mexican establishment.

Their carne asada grilled whatever-it's-called burrito was the best I've had any where, you name it. That carne asada meat was mucho tender. The best, you gotta try it!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I really like the Sandbar! Since they re-did it the decor is amazing. Very beautiful Spanish themed. Their happy hour is unbeatable too. Two for one appetizers and cheap drinks. All while seating in a beautifully decorated open space in the middle of downtown. The staff is on top of everything too. The bussers wear headsets, which is funny considering the place isnt that big, but thats probably what keeps the food coming out fast. I came here a lot in college, but now that I'm older I avoid it at night. But this is a great place for young and older adults to come for happy hour and day time eating/drinking."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Don't go here. We were seated for like 10 minutes and no one even came by our table. We went up to the hostess and asked if we were going to get any service, and 5 minutes later still no one came by. We got up and left. Don't support a restaurant that has such horrible customer service."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Service not very attentive. Lucia did not know menu. Ordered a fajita salad and she brought me a salad of oily onions and bell peppers. She said did not come with chicken. When looked at menu it said explicitly that salad included chicken. Asked her to go ask manGe and credit. She did not come back for 10 minutes and when finally asked her she said the menu was wrong. Would never have ordered a vegetarian salad for 13.75. I would not recommend this place for the service and Lucia was horrible waitress!!!
Would not recommend this place!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great spot along State Street with an outdoor eating area that has some pretty comfortable seats after a long day of walking. The drink specials are pretty awesome for happy hour get one drink and get the second for a quarter. The decor makes you feel like you're celebrating dia de Los muertos since you can find skulls and other Mexican artifacts around the place. Service was decent considering how packed they were and everything was provided in a timely manner. The food here is good with pretty generous portions, definitely a must stop whenever in Santa Barbara."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Stopped in downtown for dinner during the PCH road trip with hubby! Just walked and thought this place looked pretty damn cool! Drinks were great, margarita on margarita! Food was okay my husband and I split some bomb chicken taquitos and a huge carne Asada burrito, that was jus alright to my liking! Good service, chill vibe!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Service was excellent but the food was ok. The guacamole from the sampler was disgusting but the flautas and quesadillas were good. I thought that the guacamole bowl would be better since it supposedly contained 2 avocados and was made ""fresh"". It came out lacking in flavor and definitely had no more than half an avocado in it. I can make better guacamole at home."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good steak fajitas! skinny margarita and sangria were not that great. Service could have been better. Overall, I'd go back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,What a joke. Went there with a group of five at 2 in the afternoon. Even tho there was a big open table out front we couldn't have it because we were only ordering drinks. Several tables open!  Then when the hostess said we could not bring our bottles of water with us?  Are you kidding me?  Buh-bye
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Food and service was amazing. Come between 3 to 7 pm for happy hour. The apatizers are huge and half off!!. Order the Nachos de la casa with chicken there so yummy. Next time I'm in Santa Barbara I'd stop here again.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Lucia was an amazing server she's knows everything about the menu. Great service and great recommendations about the menu. She was ontop of everything from refilling drinks to refilling our salsas
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Ordered enchiladas, what I got was chicken wrapped in a tortilla. Dry, no cheese, no sauce, no bueno."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Best restaurant and bar on State Street.  Excellent service, thank you Lillian, food, and ambiance.  First time visited for dinner.  The new remodel makes for a cozier and warmer feeling.  
Our server was absolutely the best.  Lillian knew the menu backwards and forwards, was extremely attentive, and we loved the entire experience!!

Definitely will recommend to friends and family, and come back soon myself!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Probably won't be back. It was just mediocre. The manager was cute and gave us chips and salsa but the rest of the staff looked miserable like they hated their jobs. Not one person smiled. It is just another bar. When we initially got seated the hostess told us it was happy hour and the drinks were 2 for 1. Come to find out, only a couple drinks were included for that happy hour special and the 2 for 1 had to be the same drink. It is served in smaller glasses than the margarita glasses and in the end it is like paying regular price for one drink since it equaled out to the same amount. Made no sense at all! At least the appetizers were half off. As a Santa Barbara tourist, I would probably look for a different place to eat and drink. Maybe if I was a college student or local I would come here to hangout."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Walked 10 blocks from the hotel to Sanbar for happy hour.  Got to the restaurant and was told they don't allow backpacks.  Huh?  Shopping... walking... snacks... backpacks... Its a tourist area. No backpacks?  Lame.  I guess looking at the reviews from others I am glad we didn't go in.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"had a nice day walking with hub on state st.  we'd been walking down state st. trying to look for the perfect sun spot for a drink & a bite for lunch.  this was the perfect spot on that  nice, warm sunny day for a grande glass of margarita on the rocks, chips & salsa & tacos.  i LOVED my fried fish tacos & my hub's chicken & steak tacos were tasty too. 

no complaints here.  got good service, good drinks, good food, & good sun!    glad we had a pleasant experience compared to other reviewers.  pretty chill & mellow the time we came."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"My husband and I came here because they had an outdoor patio that showed the Dodgers vs. Cardinals playoff game and allowed dogs. They technically allowed dogs, but they had to be leashed outside of their fence. It's not like Lazy Dog Cafe where they can literally be next to you on the patio. Thank goodness it wasn't that busy because we were able to sit next to the fence near our dogs. I used to come here during my college days to party and drink, but I never had their food menu. We ordered their trio of chili relleno, enchiladas, and tacos and fish tacos. The only thing I really enjoyed was the beef tacos. Other than that, their food is mediocre and nothing to brag about. They're located right at the heart of State St., so there's plenty of foot traffic of tourists and local SB residents and college students. I love the environment that State St. offers, so that's a plus for me to come back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Had brunch here this morning and you can't beat the price. The bartender Brandon was great! Super attentive and never let our glasses get empty. Will definitely be returning
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Alle Jahre wieder. Nette Location mit tollen Bieren vom Fass. Hervorragender Tequila. Kein besonderes Publikum und kein besonderes Essen. Alles in allem aber ein typische California Bar
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,we tried to enter the restaurant at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night which was half empty and one of us had a USA basketball t-shirt on and they refused us entry cuz we were wearing a team shirt. Never heard anything so dumb as we are proud of the USA and we were ready to spend a bunch of money on drinjs and dinner. We will never go back.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,The black dude at the bar in the back over charged me for my drinks. He pocketed it too because i checked the orders and my $26 of cash for 2 drinks wasnt on the bill.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came here on a tuesday afternoon, the server was really sweet! The location is great and the raspberry mimosa was delish! But the fish tacos were to die for!!!!! Only like 7 bucks for some really good tacos. I cant wait to get back up to SB for another round!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good location. Cute outdoor decor. Friendly waiters. & food was delicious!

Its not really mexican food..more mexi-cali/american. Food was good prices & happy hour was nice too :)

When i visit Santa Barbara again I'll come back here!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"It was Santa Barbara Pride weekend and we needed last minute dinner reservations for 7 guests!  My friend Troy was able to reserve a table at Sandbar.  Great location right on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara.

We arrived to find the host and hostess asking some drunken customers to leave the restaurant!  I was really impressed with how they handled the situation and were able to be friendly while deescalating things.

After they were out of the way... we checked in and inquired about a table on the front patio.  The staff quickly cleared the table and got us seated!  

All throughout dinner, not only the server, but the manager also continued to check on us.  Such friendly staff... even wished us a happy Pride weekend!  Food and drinks arrived promptly.  Everything was delicious.  Splitting the bill 7 ways?  No problem for them!

Thanks for an amazing dinner handsome Arthur, hottie Luke, and adorable Heather!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I have been to Santa Barbara several times, but this is the first time we have been to Sand Bar. 

Not only was the food delish, the margaritas we had were amazing too! Our server Lillian was not only friendly, she was very knowledgeable and helpful with suggestions. 

We had fajitas (yum!!!), and a breakfast burrito on the brunch menu. We had HUGE, tasty margaritas as well.

As we were leaving Lillian Drew us a map on something we had asked her about. How sweet is that? She went above and beyond to make sure we where happy and satisfied. 

If you are in the area and want Mexican... Go here! :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Chips/salsa were below average. Menu selection was good. Had the chicken con queso burrito- very tasty.  Great atmosphere. Good happy hour specials. Service was mediocre.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Best restaurant and bar on State Street.  Excellent service, thank you Lillian, food, and ambiance.  First time visited for dinner.  The new remodel makes for a cozier and warmer feeling.

Wow, visited again on May 12, 2017 and once again this great place impressed all of our foursome.   We came in from a long and exhausting cycling trip.  Food, service, and value all spot on!!! Dustdin, was the key to making this an unforgettable visit.

Probably visiting in the near future!!!

Thank you Dustdin!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great location, good food, great ambiance.  Recommend for hanging out with groups.  Ok place when with kids."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"They have a great happy hour from 3-7 Sunday-Friday. Buy one drink and get another for a quarter. (Wells, Calls, All Mexican Draft Beers, Domestic Drafts, and House Wines) $6.50 skinny margaritas and house margaritas!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Ein überfüllter Laden, der leider nicht mit deutschen Clubs zu vergleichen ist. Es werden starke Drinks serviert, demensprechend ist das Publikum (geschätztes Durchschnittsalter Mitte 20) ziemlich schnell ziemlich voll. Dennoch wird nicht zu der Charts-Mukke getanzt, sondern nur volltrunken rumgebaggert
Um 2 Uhr ist (wie überall in CA) Schluss."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Amazing service from Tarrah and a great tequila sunrise! Will be coming back. Definitely join the birthday club- really great deals
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The experience was great.  We only came in to get an ice tea and sat at the bar.   Jeremy who was serving at the bar was fantastic.   He asked us how we were, where we we from etc.   He was great.   Even offered us a coupon to come back for brunch, but said to us have a great stay if we don't come back.  Thanks for a great experience."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place will receive no stars from me... We were walking up state street with our daughters on Saturday before Father's Day and stumbled across this place... They were able to seat is quickly so we decided to try it... The food was ok, but the manager is a JERK!!!! My 5yr old is autistic and has certain quirks, one being shredding paper to keep her calm and dinner peaceful... We had almost finished our dinner and everything was going great until the manager walked us to us and told us not to let her drop paper on the floor because he doesn't want his guys to have to keep cleaning it up.... It's a restaurant duche bag stuff is gonna fall on the floor!!!!  Our family goes out to restaurants on a very regular basis and have never had anyone say anything to us about her paper, we always clean up her mess on our own before we leave and usually they tell us not to worry about it... This A-hole basically ruined the experience and humiliated us in the process... The place is crowded and close quarters so others heard him and we pretty much packed up and left immediately... Is he going to tell a parent with a toddler to make sure they don't drop their food on the floor????? This was very upsetting!!! Not a good place to go if you or your family member have special needs and if you want to Support the cause don't go to this place - the manager discriminates!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love Sandbar! This is one of coolest places to hang out at in SB! The decor and the ambiance is amazing! Spanish/Mexican decor and paintings. The music is great during the day Spanish guitar and classic rock when I was there. Which is so great to not hear top 40's crap like you do everywhere else. 
The food is amazing as well as the presentation. They have a great happy hour, buy 1 get one for 25 cents. How rad is that? All in all I can't wait to come back at night time, I hear it gets poppin!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Food, slightly above average
Atmosphere, above average
Special, plenty (Margarita Mondays, taco Tuesdays, etc...)
Definitely a seasonal stop. Outdoor seating in early fall is perfect."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Used to be one of my favorite lunch spots until the hostess rudely asked my friend and I to leave AFTER she had already seated us (we are both 20) on St. Patrick's Day around 3 pm. We felt so uncomfortable and unwelcome, as the hostess awkwardly stared us down until we left and handled the situation in such an unprofessional manner. After asking if the other restaurants on State had this same policy, she simply shrugged and told us I don't know and to walk ""that way"" and find something else as she then proceeded to stand and watch silently as we tried to leave with some dignity.  Had she have explained in a kind manner that St. Patrick's Day was the exception to their allowing under 21s to dine, we would not have been so upset. We will never go back again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Definitely always make it to Sandbar when I am visiting santa barbara.  Good food and drinks are not usually too expensive.  The ambiance is also great.  Definitely recommended.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great place for friends and dates. Used to live in Santa Barbara and this is by far one of my fav places. Great mexican. Good cheep Margaritas during happy hour. Good happy hour specials. Nice outdoor patio. Good vibe.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,The food was good. The  server wasn't very consistent and that was annoying. They could work on being more efficient and consistent.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I was in Santa Barbara shopping on a beautiful day and I thought this place looked like a great spot for people watching.  I was seated outside right along State St. Ordered a few drinks from the happy hour menu. 2 for the price of one...not bad at all.   I did have to ask for chips and salsa which I thought was kind of odd. I ordered a carnitas chimichunga with beans and rice on the side. We did not wait long for our food. The food was good and very reasonably priced. The refried beans and rice were very tasty. Maybe the best beans I have had at a restaurant. Overall I really enjoyed this place especially the location. The only reason I did not give it another star was the service. The young staff did not seem too eager to help out anyone with anything.  Good servers know how to go out of the way to help someone, the crew they had that day should not be in the service industry."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Pretty standard Americanized Mexican food. Aka there's better prices and better places. To eat and drink.  But I did get a handjob under a table there one night. So I'll bump it up to 3 stars
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Arthur the manager and his team handled our large party with ease! Fifty or so people and we were graciously accommodated and the food was tasty! I had the fajitas and they are very good. The atmosphere is perfect for a celebration. Lots of great seating areas, and plenty of televisions in the bar and back area. The servers were excellent as well. It's the type of restaurant where you don't necessarily need your specific server to get assistance. Anyone is happy to help. Another bonus is that we were given our check by table. So I was at a table with 3 others and we only had to be concerned with our own bill. Lastly, we spent lots of time taking photos and more than once we were in the way of servers coming to and from the kitchen. They would wait for us to get the picture before walking past. So nice!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I went to Sandbar with my Industry boys for the first time and Tarrah helped us out with our drinks. She was so friendly, and helpful and made the experience worth being there. We've been to a lot of bars in SB, and this is hands down one of the best experiences we've had. 5 our of 5 would recommend. We'll be back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We were there around noon on a Sunday, so we didn't experience the party scene described by others. I enjoyed the chips and salsa and my chicken fajitas, but my favorite part was the blended raspberry margaritas with fresh fruit. Yum! They had blueberry, too, but I had to cut myself off.

My one complaint is that they didn't have black beans, only refried. I am not a fan of refried beans, but my hub is. He sampled mine, and said they were fantastic. He's still talking about them.

Great place to sit at an outside table, down some margaritas and watch the world go by."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I visited Sandbar on a Friday evening for dinner/drinks with a group of four. We sat indoors (open air) and immediately I was impressed with the decor... fire lamps and mood lighting plus leather lounge chairs, plush booths with pillows, etc. Nice.

The ""impressed"" part of the experience ended there. 

Our server gave us a happy hour menu with drink specials until 8pm at the top (it was 7:30pm at the time) and happy hour appetizers below it. My boyfriend ordered a Jack and Coke from the happy hour special (buy one for $6, get one for a quarter). I contemplated ordering a Corona or something as the 25-cent counterpart but decided not to take them up on the $0.25 drink. We both got orders of the ~$5 chicken nachos on the happy hour menu. 

When our server returned she brought two Jack and Cokes... apparently they just double whatever you order, which would have been nice to know since even though it's only $0.25 we didn't need an extra. Oh well. The chicken nachos came out and were absolutely huge. We immediately knew we could have split one order but we thought, ""Oh well, they were $5 so who cares."" 

When the bill came our nachos were each $10.25. When we asked our server (now a guy instead of the girl who had served us all night) why they rang up at twice the price he said happy hour for food ends at 7pm and it's at the bar only. We protested that the girl who took our order didn't say anything about that when she clearly saw our whole group (not just my boyfriend and I) ordering from the happy hour menu card, and he apologized that ""the hostesses are supposed to explain that but that sometimes they don't."" They did not reduce our bill. Also, our $6 drink was $7 on the bill plus $0.25 for the second one we didn't need or want. So, a) the hostess didn't have the decency to say ""hey just so you know the happy hour prices ended 30 minutes ago"" b) she got $1.25 extra out of us for a drink we didn't order without explaining how that special worked and c) she didn't say, as nice servers often do, ""the nachos are actually very large if you want to split."" 

Judging by the other reviews we aren't the only patrons this has happened to."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Arrived into Santa Barbara hungry and Sandbar looked pretty appealing from the outside. The prices looked good as well as menu and the they even had the Giants game on! We get seated and order drinks, 10 minutes to get us our drinks, another 5 minutes to order our food. After we recieved our food, did not hear from our server again. Service was horrific, we even ordered stuff and it never came, our section was empty too! On top of that they turned off the Giants game right before the game ended. Never coming back to Sandbar again. Strike One Santa Barbara"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I am visiting from out of town and was excited to stop by this bar after dinner. However, the bouncer looked at my ID and told me that the only way I would get it back was from a police officer and that using a fake ID was a felony charge. I am 25 years old. Ive never had anything like this happen and am completely appalled by their rudeness and complete lack of respect."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came up to Santa Barabar to visit over the weekend.  Went here on a Saturday night and had a blast.  

They have two different dj's (one indoor and another for the outdoor area.  The dj's were spectacular- amazing music and mixes.  

The atmosphere at night is really cool.   Great mix of music and mellow crowd.   Highly recommend this place if you want to have fun."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My daughters will be going to school here, so when we came down to look at housing, the downtown was where to look for dinner. Several places on the block were more upscale, but Sandbar was pretty full, and the prices looked reasonable.  Good solid mexican food, good beer selection, and a lively indoor-outdoor atmosphere."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,This place is awsome! Right off the main street. Chill place to hang out or to party at night. Best place to drink!! Good happy hour deals and good service.  Buy one get one for 25cent drinks!! Can't beat that!!! The bartenders are very friendly and quick.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love this place. It has always been one of my favorite ways to start off a night out. The drinks are great, although the service is often slow. The crowd is young and not quite as trashy as many other bars in sb. The atmosphere contributes to the pleasant vibes."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Really poor service sat at small bar and I usually get awesome sevice out of bartenders. This guy wouldn't even look at me or give me menu. Borrowed guys next to me and then it took ten minutes for bartender to give me time of day to order soup. The outside is what appealed to me but do not fall for it
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Service is bad. Hostesses are rude. Food is blah. 

Drinks are good! Atmosphere is fun and chill and very SB. If it's longer than a 15 minute wait, it's not worth it. There are ton of fun places on state street that are worth your time."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We came by with a largISH group in the late afternoon on a Saturday. They said we had to be out by 5, we said sure. I thought we would be able to get some food within 2 hours...boy I was wrong. There were about six people at my table. They totally forgot my drink...waitress flat out said they forgot and then they never took our food order even when we asked multiple times. We had difficulty flagging down our waitress so we started asking other staff members who would randomly walk by. They said that the waitress assigned to our table had to take our order and that they would find her. By the time she came around to check in on us...it was too late for us to actually order anything. Oh the sangria was decent. I would only go here for drinks...maybe. It was so frustrating to have to leave this place and find another one for food.  No bueno."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Everything was superb - food, drinks, decor (some really fascinating art, not the usual Mexican restaurant schlock), and service, and prices were appropriate. Can definitely recommend the Enchiladas de Mariscos (with shrimp and fish) and also the Carne Asada and Grilled Relleno; the latter contained a surprisingly large portion of excellent steak. Also, and this is a must, the flan, which was out of this world superb. The first bite was a bit of a shock because it was served warm, but that definitely made it even better."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I've had absolutely terrible service on multiple visits. Clearly this isn't something they care to improve and I will not be back.
Don't waste your time or money."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Will never be back!!!!

After seeing a show at the Santa Barbara bowl we asked a cab driver for a recommendation for some late night food, she took us to Sandbar. We arrived at Sandbar at around 10:15 walked to the hostess and made sure they were still serving food. She confirmed that they were gave us two menus and told us it was open seating and to take a seat wherever we were comfortable. We walked into the back of the restaurant and sat at a booth. It was rather loud and as my husband and I looked around us we realized there was an ongoing bikini contest. Good people watching. 
We then sat at our table for about 15 minutes without being greeted by anyone even though the table directly next to us had a waitress that had been to them numerous times. Finally after about 20 minutes someone came to our table dropped off chips and salsa and walked quickly away. We waited about 5 more minutes allowing ourselves to become a little more enraged before deciding we should leave. To add insult to injury as we walked out we saw the waitress (girl who wears pink flowers in your hair you know who you are) who had been helping the other tables around us and had completely ignored us just hanging out with the hostess and door guy. 

Both my husband and I are long time servers and take great pride in our jobs. This establishment obviously cares very little to staff themselves with employees who feel the same. I wish I could comment on the food or ambiance but thanks to such terrible... actually nonexistent service I have nothing else to report."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I was on vacation in Ventura and we went to spend the day in Santa Barabara. We were hungry, so we decided to try this place. We had someone under 21 with us and were told to find a table, so we did. Then they told us we couldn't go inside and someone would seat us? Confusing. Then we sat, I ordered a beer and food. We got the food, never got the beer. We had to wave another waiter down to get my beer, but by that time we were almost finished eating. The seating was very high, almost impossible to get into the chairs. I thought this was more of a college hang out atmosphere. The service was ok, but not the best."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Stopped by here on the way to Ventura last weekend. We had ""The Perfect Margaritas"" and they were good! The shreded chicken tasted like it was from a can, yuck! Fish tacos were good! The decor was fun, our waitress was very nice. Will definitely return!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We had dinner at Sandbar while we were in town for my sister's bachelorette party. We loved it! Cool atmosphere and delicious margaritas. I wish we had stayed there all night, because we left and went to EOS (we had a package there) and sandbar was clearly the better choice! Very fun!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,This place is the BOMB!!!! food is Mexican Cuisine at its finest! We went on 5/13/2015 with my wife. The service was great from start to finish! Our waitress Aby was the best waitress ever! she greeted us with a smile even though the Restaurant was very busy. Thank you Aby!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Came in here for happy hour with my mom. Alex was a great server. The drink/food prices were unbeatable for the portion size during happy hour. Loved the vibe of the bar so much we went back the next day. Would definitely recommend. Alex (along with the other staff members) were polite and engaging.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Tarrah is the best!!! Yummy drinks and sick dog videos. Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Looking for great food, awesome drinks, friendly staff, a nightclub that will have you on the dance floor all night long? Then SANDBAR is the spot to be at ! Always a great time !"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I was in Santa Barbara over the weekend having great day until we decide to come to the Sand Bar. I been going there for many years but this time it was the worse services I ever had. We got inside the restaurant waiting to get seated. This waitress or hostess show us to a table which she didn't even ask if this was ok which it was a bad table. My brother tried to say something but she left in a hurry. I kindly went to the front of the restaurant to see if I COULD BE MOVED TO A DIFFERENT TABLE, I preferred a booth which there where three available and tables that where vacant. The waitress said she could not accommodate us because those seats where taken or reserved, which they where not because I heard her tell those customers is this ok. I really think that was really bad business when one of your staff members did what she did. She through the menus down, like she did care for our bossiness. The day was Saturday around 2pm. So we left and I will not be back. Your can tell that staff member that she should treat all customer the same because you never know  who they are. Thanks for putting a bad taste in my mouth. I still cant believe she was that rude."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"After a good few hours of helping my sister move into her new SB apartment, we craved Mexican and remember that this place was on State Street.

Atmosphere: The outdoors-y feel is nice and festive, especially on nice Summer days. Very casual, very crowded looking.

Food: Ordered the Supreme Burrito with Carne Asada. The portion was HUGE and the burrito was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. Price is decent as well ($9/$10)

Service: The waiters/waitresses are attractive (it is SB after all). Service can be a bit slow though since it's so crowded, but nothing too bad."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Every time I've come here I've had a great experience. I work across the street so I eat here at least once a week and I come here to drink on Thursdays for college night. Food has always been delicious. Drink specials are nice on Thursdays. I love the new happy hour menu, the portions are pretty big for $4-$5 bucks. Everyone is really friendly."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We went from almost 5 star to a 2.5 star (sorry can't do point five star so looks like just 2). Breakfast deal is gone. Now there is no drink included. 9 bucks for breakfast and 9 bucks for a drink. Such a bummer that they changed their deal of breakfast and a drink for 7 bucks. Great chips (got an extra star for chips), but lost it again for the hung over/high staff with inappropriate clothing on. I never want to see ass cheeks hanging out of my waitresses shorts.   *With all that said they have great Mexican food and margaritas! The best breakfast deal in town is now over"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The food here was great and my friends enjoyed their drinks..when they came 20 minutes after ordering them! We made a reservation for 11 people on a Tuesday evening, so we thought we might be given good service for reserving a nice spot in the back a month in advance. The service we got at this restaurant was awful which sucks because the food was amazing. Our servers name was Casey, and she didn't smile a single time while serving us. As a party of 11, she hardly came around to check in on us to see if we needed anything. When it came time for the bill she wouldn't split it up for us and then disappeared for another 20 minutes for us to figure out who pays what. Eventually we got up and tracked her down to made her take down all of our orders a second time so she could make up each of our bill. We were sick of only seeing her every half hour and we were ready to leave! It almost ruined the night but once we got out we went to some better bars! Please improve the customer service because the food is delicious."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great service, great food, great drinks. My margarita was pretty strong, which I can appreciate at a restaurant (normally they aren't worth the money). I got a taco and enchilada combo plate which was plenty of food and quite tasty. I think this restaurants strong point is the atmosphere - open, outdoor seating with beautiful lighting and nice music. Not so dark that you can't see, but creates a cool vibe. The staff was very capable and friendly, from start to finish. Definitely where I take all my out of town guests!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We stumbled upon Sandbar last Saturday night while looking for a place to have some drinks.  The atmosphere was great with the patio and heated lamps.  The drinks were very good and reasonably priced.  It was very crowded and took us awhile to find a sit, but after all it was late Saturday night.  I would go back again!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,My friend Robin and party of four were not let in because one person had baggy jeans. Not the way to run a business let alone a club type of business. You won't be seeing any of my groups going there ever again.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This review is for the nightlife only... 

Decent priced drinks, douchbags galore & skanky girls all around, along with half nekkid go-go dancers. Great for people watching!!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,We had a slight incident with the host but it was quickly resolved when the manager Art went above and beyond his duties to accommodate us. The food was delicious and our waitress Jenny was great!! We will definitely be recommending this place to our friends & we plan on returning soon!!! Thank you Sandbar and Art!!!! It truly was a pleasure!! #weekendsbirthday #crutch
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Love this spot. Energetic crowd, great music and attentive bartender. Matt took awesome care of us and was quick to refill the drinks when we got low. Didn't try the food, but everyone said I should so will next time for sure!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Everything looks good here but is nothing really special. The entire staff is super nice and it seems to be a nice spot to come for a drink or two and they have a bunch of tvs for sports. 

El supreme burrito is too much cheese and rice. 
Chile rellano is very tasty. (Fried)
The steak con salsa was lacking flavor. 
Taquitos were just not good at all. 

There's a bunch of Mexican restaurants here so I'm sure you can find a better option."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Pretty restaurant. Came for drinks and appetizers. They have a happy hour which consists of drinks. Ordered cucumber watermelon. Really good. 

Complimentary salsa and chips. Chips were nicely crisp and salsa had a good amount of heat. Sea bass cerviche had chunks of fresh sea bass. Was good

Drinks took a while to arrive because they had only one bartender. But didn't get water until we asked twice. Server was busy?"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This particular incident happened multiple weeks ago, but it's been weighing on my mind ever since. Two guys I met earlier in the night, who were both very respectful and genuine people, were not allowed in the bar. This was because the manager, a shorter gentleman with zero hair and a bad attitude, wouldn't allow them into the establishment. They were not drunk or acting in a disorderly manner at all and were very cordial. I can't stand when our vets get treated with disrespect and I hope this will be remedied in the future!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Happy hour is awesome. Get the nachos and watermelon lemonade. My absolute favorite thing on their menu has to be the blended mojito! I don't know why it's so good but I will make a trip just to sandbar for the blended mojito!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This is place is sooo fun! I used to go here all the time in college and it was always a BLAST! Cinco de Mayo is definitely the best day I have been here they gave out sombreros and it was just so fun! My friends and I went for alumni weekend recently and it was just as fun! Not as crowded as I remember it but we went at kind of an off time...

We sat around the fire put which adds a great ambiance for about 2 hours and had some margaritas and relaxed in the sun. Although it is a chill vibe in the day, at night this place can get wild with a DJ and dance floor! They pretty much provide something for everyone.

The unique thing about sandbar is that it is both indoor and outdoor, so it is a good day to go on days with great weather, which is pretty frequently in Santa Barbara!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Went here last Sunday for lunch with some family visiting from the east coast.  Everything was excellent - our table, the drinks, the food, and our server Logan.  We didn't know anything about Sandbar, just stumbled upon it and figured even average Mexican food is usually tolerable.  But Sandbar exceeded all of our expectations.  Everything we ordered was fresh, tasty, and delicious.  I will definitely be back the next time I am in SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Used to love coming here because the music wasn't as shitty as everywhere else (I.e sharkeez, o'malley's) but it's literally shit music now. Wish they would stick to beats that non-white people would enjoy... aka not Jason derulo and Katy perry. 
Tried to ask DJ nicely to change and now no one is dancing.... take a hint and read your audience"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"great happy hour. 2 for 1 on beers, house margaritas, sangria, and certain wines (from 4-8pm) and half off all appetizers (from 4-7pm). we came on a friday night at 6:45pm and it wasn't too busy. by the time we sat down and ordered it was 5 past 7 and, at first they said appetizers were full price but when I told them I had gotten there before 7pm, they honored the half off price.

me and my friends all got the appetizer combo, which had a nice variety and great to munch on while scarfing down margaritas."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Average Mexican food. I don't understand how this plays can be so popular. Service was good but that's it
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great place for Happy Hour!  Service was awesome on a busy Thursday night!  Try it out.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Stumbled upon this cool place while walking around and exploring the town. Immediately drawn in by the view of people having a good time. The food was delicious and the staff was attentive, but I like the overall decor and feel of the place. Didn't have any drinks, because had a long drive back to SF, but will certainly sample some tequila at my next visit!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We have been here several times in the past year, just for happy hour. Mostly our experience has been ok. Drinks are fine (can't say no to 2-fers!!!), food is fine (nachos with steak is pretty good, chicken tenders are not good), and we have had some lovely bartenders and servers. 

Tonight was pretty blegh though. There seemed to be about 15-20 people working on the floor but there was little service being offered. When the place is maybe half full, this is a worry. Everyone seemed to be more interested talking between themselves. Bartender in the Houston shirt was a dick. Tried to pour me a more expensive drink than what I had asked for, multiple times. He also swore up and down that the margarita mix was gluten free to my friend, when in the past we have been told by other bartenders to avoid it. Our food took forever, and was lukewarm when arrived. We had to find our own cutlery, because the server we grabbed to get some for us seemed confused as to what cutlery was! Lastly, the receipt we got was not itemized, just a total, which makes me think that the bartender screwed us over on the happy hour pricing.

The only good thing was that it wasn't that noisy in there.

I realize that it is hard to hire people in this town that actually care about their job, but clearly, Sandbar goes for quantity over quality in who they have represent them. We aren't going to be back for a while. Two stars for cheap drinks."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"drinks not great and slow service on a Sunday night. Ambience was the best part, liked the patio."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great food, enchiladas maricos were great! Drinks are horrible. The margaritas were so generic and the sangria had a flavor of medicine. Overall the service was great as well as the food. To drink and happy hour you're better off at the liquor store."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Every time I've walked by, I've always felt ""Tourist trap, don't do it"" - Not sure why today was different. I mean Mexican food in SB is a dime a dozen and more often than not - the really ""trendy"" places are a raging disappointment.

The hostess mentioned that if we were cold to let her know and they'd be happy to turn the heaters on (it's in the 70's today but the section we were in was kinda drafty) and she even offered to hold our stroller for us.

Aliex is literally hands down one of the top 5 best servers I've had in SB. He was super attentive, great energy and kind. You can tell that he's passionate about what he does and truly enjoys it. He should give server training to literally every establishment in SB. The food could have been garbage and I'd still be stoked to have been there.

The food is NOT garbage btw - it was surprisingly different and tasty. I'm pretty confident that the steak for their nachos is braised in unicorn magic. It was unbelievably tender and flavorful and NOT salty (something hard to come by in SB).The burritos are incredibly large - I mean - enough to feed 2-3 people probably. He was also really nice about our odd food requests (usually servers get super annoyed - but it's hard to get kids to try something new).

The bussers were friendly - attentive and sincere. This was absolutely not the norm for SB. So glad we stopped in. Can't wait to go back again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came here for dinner a couple weekends ago and chose it because it was literally the only restaraunt on state st. that hadn't converted to a club yet and was still serving dinner. I was wary because it seemed as though it would be one of those over priced foo-foo Mexican restaraunts that serves bland food. I'm happy to report it was the total opposite. Well, still pricey, but REALLY good. The drinks are super fresh and yummy, none of that syrupy B.S., and my carne asada burritto was bursting with flavor. Would definitely splurge and  eat here again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Oh, this place...rude staff, they hire pretty girls, which is nice to look at--too bad they don't actually know how to be decent waitresses, the food is average (don't bother with the appetizer combo, waste of money), and as a night-time bar it's always overcrowded, almost impossible to get drinks and the bartenders are just plain rude. They also have two DJ's at once, which sounds like a good idea (different music for different people)., until you're caught in the awkward in between place where both are blaring in your ears... On the upside, there are usually good looking people here, and since it's so damn crowded, you'll end up rubbing up against someone, whether you like it or not.

If you don't care about shitty service, this is the place for you."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This should have much higher average reviews!

Great tacos, fun atmosphere, on a great street. 

Get the fish tacos or the carne."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Very bad service. Half of the tables were free but the hosts said there is 15 min wait time and when we seated at the bar to wait she said it's busy and we better leave phone number and she will give us a call when they have tables...
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Had a quick lunch and a sangria and can say they were good. Place was awesome and great people working there. We took a minute to cool down and enjoy the parade of the day for the 4th of July
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Horrible service went at 545pm wasn't too busy refused to seat us outside since we were going to have drinks and appetizers. Once we agreed we'd sit at the Firefox the hostess told us we have to park our stroller on the street. The stroller is a 10lb umbrella stroller which I even said I could fold up and put any where inside (they had several spaces to store it). Hostess was extremely rude and uninviting. We ended up at a place close by no issues had several drinks and appetizers spent around $150 on high margin items (liquor and finger snacks) probably more than they would have made on dinner. 
Definately don't recommend this place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,if you are visiting santa barbara do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  The sevice is absolutely horrible! while i was there for the last time for ufc 118 there were several couples expressing the exact same thing about how bad the service is and they would never come back. you have been warned!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Sadly, the phrase, ""cheap is cheap"" is true at this restaurant. When I first went by it, I was excited. It has a great ambiance and an awesome happy hour. I got some nachos with chicken for under $5. Great price, but when I got the food, I wasn't impressed. The nachos tasted as if they were missing something."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Let me start by saying this is ONLY a review on their food. I love their margaritas and cocktail hour!!!
Sad to say I feel terribly disappointed with the Sandbar.  I had only came for late night drinks and a night of fun,  I decided to eat lunch here and let me just say HUGE MISTAKE!!! The food was not good at all! I had the Fish fajitas.. HAA,  it was more like a plate of onions with a slice of fish. The Fish WAS OVER Cooked Which Made It HARD AND  Worst Of ALL IT HAD NO FLAVOR! I literally had to sit there and use the steak knife to cut through it and once I took a bite of it it made me feel like i was chewing on a hard piece of gum. 
For the price of the plate I was definitely expecting something better. My boyfriend ordered and 805 beer and it was warm and half of the cup was all FOAM. IT is sad to say we will only see u as a bar and not a restaurant!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Happy hour, umm 2 for 1 ( sangria, house margaritas, just to name a couple). The nachos are good! (the chicken is grilled semi shredded, different from other places I've ever seen). We also ordered this platter that came with taquitos, flautas, chicken tenders, all yummy
I want to come back here and sit in one of the areas with the pit =]"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great happy hour deals. Cool atmosphere. Dinner was excellent. Wednesday nights they have a live Reggae band at 10pm. Great place for dinner & drinks.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"i was up in SB for my birthday celebration (on a surprise trip from the BF aww ) and i had said i wanted an outdoor patio with some yum food, the sandbar delivered. we were sat right away on the patio, that is surrounded by overhead strung bulb lights, chandeliers and candles. they have a fire pit that has about eight chairs around it. if i ever am up in SB at night i will definitely hit up their happy four from 4-7 and enjoy the mood lighting. 

the place was busy but we were still served quickly and never left sitting too long without a refill :) I got a house marg and wasnt too crazy about it, so switched over to a sweet tea half and half which hit the spot on this sunny afternoon. my favorite part however was the shrimp tacos, everything was fresh, the sauce they used with them complimented the grilled shrimp perfectly.

the bf got the carne asada burrito, he said it was very americanized obviously but was delicious. i tried a piece of the steak and it was very tender and the burrito packed, definitely get your money's worth."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Jason at Sandbar is amazing. He made me and my friend the most amazing drinks & was very fun! Thank you thank you so much for taking care of us and making us have a good time!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"They have THE best chile rellenos EVER!!  Great service, the food came so! The chicken me is awesome, my husband raved about the braised beef!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Atmosphere was great although the outside really makes the place. Inside is a little small and very dark. Bartender was very friendly although the happy hour margarita was a little on the sweet side and seems like they cut out some of the alcohol. Had to add a star for the music alone. I sat down and they played a song from karate kid and now eye of the tiger is playing, how can you beat that?  Got the grilled asada burrito with carne asada. Definitely recommend the carne asada. Would come here again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great happy hour!! Margaritas are on point and the food is delicious and fresh. Check out the tostada salad.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Good Club in SB-Downtown. But i would recommed the Bars and Clubs around UCSB.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great food, even greater happy hour and great service! The environment is a huge plus and I have never had better service in life! Excellent waitress, Chelsea was her name! She was awesome!!!!!!!!! Literally awesome !

Will be returning! For sure!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I love going to sandbar. The vibe is relaxed and and everyone that works there is really nice. Gini is the best!!! Always great service. Happy hour has good deals and the chips and salsa are the best.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Very good food. We went here on Cinco de Mayo so we definitely had a blast. Their guacamole is to die for. The problem I had was that I ordered the veggie tacos. They come in the form of three very miniature sized tacos (with bad-tasting tortilla bread) which were cute but what bothered me was that the sauce described for the veggie tacos is labeled as ""sweet chipotle"". Now, since I don't enjoy anything too hot or spicy I figured this would be right up my alley. WRONG. The ""sweet chipotle"" is has so much heat i couldn't make it past one taco. The waitress came over and said ""You didn't like the veggie tacos, huh?"" And I said ""No, not for me, unfortunately."" To which she responded, ""Yea, it's too spicy for you, isn't it? A lot of people never make it past the first one because they don't realize it's going to be so spicy."" SO, this restaurant KNOWS that they are advertising their food incorrectly and instead of correcting the problem, they allow people to keep ordering it and not receive what they are expecting for their dollar. On top of that, I wasn't offered to replace it with something I did want or to remove it from the bill. As amazing as the appetizers were, that whole episode knocked this restaurant to three stars for me. Change your menu or change your tacos, it's not rocket science."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Had an amazing dinner. The carne asada was the best I have ever had. The enchiladas mariscos were positively magical. The best part of the meal was our server Jesilyn. Thanks for a great dinner. Next time we are in Santa Barbara we will join you again.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Worst dining experience I have ever had. Had lunch at the bar and the food was just so-so. The service was ATROCIOUS! So much so that I thought I might be on one of those hidden camera shows. The staff could not be bothered as they were fully engaged in really loud and inappropriate conversations. Will be warning everyone about this place!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Door man was a bag of tools. Wouldn't accept my wife's Washington state ID or her military ID. Didn't ask for date of birth. We moved from washington to California. Whoever hired that moron should be fired.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great spot for nightlife & weekend fun! Would recommend this place to travelers & people stopping by!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I still can't understand the appeal. 

The TV's are horribly placed so more than likely, you will be directly under your team's broadcast (or in a blind-spot). 

For as cute as the hostesses are (for the most part), the service is unsurprisingly poor. 

I'd tell you what we think of the host (dude), but I'm a good Christian. 

And the place smells horrible. So you have to sit outside. Except there is a wait and/or you have to order food and your whole party must be there, even if you have a party of three at a four person table and someone calls you last minute because they got off work early and wants to meet up."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,This spot has really improved since the remodel. Seems like more people can be there without it feeling as crowded. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend this as a place to grab a drink. They also have great food.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My boyfriend and I ate here during a quick trip to Santa Barbara.  We were seated right away even though the restaurant was packed.  Our server took great care of us and was there every single time we needed more salsa, drinks, etc. My boyfriend had a good burrito with camerones and I had some amazing grilled mahi tacos. They were light but extremely flavorful. I would definitely order the same thing again! They were offering 2 for 1 margaritas which was a great deal and they were pretty good too. One downside... I saw a group of 4 adults with 2 kids in strollers walk up to the hostess station. The manager came out and told them that there was no room to accommodate seating with the two strollers so they were told to leave. He even went as far as to say that there were already 2 kids inside so there is no room for any more.  I have worked in the service industry for many years and I don't think they should have turned away the business. At that time, there were a few tables open and they could have just moved around some chairs to make space for the strollers.  I guess this is NOT a kid friendly place.  I wonder what the owner of this restaurant would think!?"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Poor service. Bartender had an attitude and didn't bother to serve us until we asked him a few times. No food menu was offered until asked and nobody bothered to ask if we wanted to order anything from the menu.

Not worth a trip."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great breakfast specials on the weekends! Atmosphere is cool. Service is on point.

I will definitely be back when in SB again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I've been around state street, and going into downtown Santa Barbara for years now.  From when I used to hit the bars with a fake id while up visiting my sister at UCSB to my swinging maturity that I currently reside in.  Sandbar(formerly Calypso's) Still is a great spot with a good energy to it.  We blew into town for a couple day's of fun and decided to start our adventures there.  Out of all the spots we went to up and down State that night, we should have stayed there the whole night.  We'll be back next time we're in town most definitely."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Thursday night special is 2 drinks for $3. If the line at Madison's is too long for you (because they have $1 drinks that night) then this is a great place to go. The music and decorations are better too. I like the beach theme and places to sit. I've spent a lot of fun nights here.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I've been to this place multiple times and have only had bad experiences. Now I'm done. I've been here for dinner and have been disappointed with the mediocre ""Mexican"" food and horrible service. I decided to give it a shot on a Thursday (college night) and took their bus (yes i paid $10 to them) Downtown only to find out I would be denied entry (with my valid California ID) because the signature on my ID wasn't raised enough (sounds like a DMV issue). The best part of all is that they let my friend who's a girl in with an expired New York ID (ha aren't they supposed to be more suspicious of out of state ID's?) To top things off every girl that I was with was let in and I was denied entry by the male bouncer and general manager at the entrance. The establishment treats their employees and guests horribly. What a joke. Wish I could give 0 stars...just walk a little further to Casa Blanca."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This is where my wife and I went to drink the night away. As we were walking down State Street, we passed by the Sandbar and noticed it was loud, busy, and packed with beautiful people. The place was busy but we still managed to find two seats at the bar. Drinking the night away with my wife was fun. Strong drinks, loud music, good chips and salsa, and cool bartenders.

Thank goodness our hotel was walking distance from here, otherwise we would have been in trouble."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I ate there tuesday for lunch i ordered an enchilada plate. Within 5 minutes i had my meal. You might say good service, however, i have worked in hospitality for a few years and i know my meal was not fresh, and it was not brought up to the right temp. However, i gave it a shot knowing better. Turned out i was right, i have been sick for 3 days. That was the last thing i was able to eat, so thanks sandbar. Hopefully you will start cooking properly"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Was there for the second time tonight.  Last time I was there, we were there for happy hour and had the lovely pink haired bartender.  Many cheap eats and cheap drinks and good service.  Tonight, Amanda the bartender told us we couldn't order 2 drinks at once for happy hour to get the deal (as happy hour was ending soon).  So as soon as our drinks were served we ordered another one, which she then claimed was us still trying to order two drinks at once but she said she would do it.  When it was time to pay, unfortunately we just gave our cards and didn't check the bill because she charged us full price for the 2nd drink instead of the happy hour price.  Apparently Amanda doesn't realize that when you're nice and helpful to your customers they will tip you nicely as opposed to her making more money for the owners and getting a crappy tip because she basically cheated us.  Food is cheap, though. Good quesadilla.  Mediocre nachos.  Too bad Amanda ruined the experience (and the lovely pink haired one showed up when we were about to leave."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Happy Hours Rock!!!

Everyday happy hour from 4-8 where you get a 2X1 and 1/2 off appetizers from 4-7. YUMMMM.... you should try the combo appetizer -- so good!  Friendly service, great seating outside (I'd rec'd the fire pit seating area!) and great food!!!  

Great time here ..."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"$3 cover on a Tuesday night?  I was caught off guard by this.

The patio is a nice place to chill with some college-aged kids, but you gotta be able to stand the cig smoke.  Still, it's better than screaming at people while the raggae band is jamming inside.

If you can make the happy hours here, then it's a very good deal for drinks and appetizers.  It's one of the few places poppin during the week, so it's fun to come and check out."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"After reading the reviews on yelp for Sandbar I really thought to pass!! Thankfully we went anyways and could not have had a better experience!!!  The patio is perfect for  people watching and spending a long afternoon with good company.  We never  felt rushed!! As visitors we were simply looking for good ambiance and the outside patio  was GREAT!! Firepits and heating lamps!!  

The service was friendly and attentive and would not hesitate to return.  The guacamole was fresh and Fajitas were very good.  We were lucky to be there for happy hour which is actually a real happy hour w 2 for 1 drinks!!  Oh and they have flat screens everywhere with various sports throughout the day!

Many compliments to the manager Art and his staff as I was really expecting far less and felt compelled to ask for him only to to offer my compliments after reading less then desirable reviews.  Great experience at Sandbar and obvious they care about your experience!  Highly recommended for a chillin good time!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I loved this place. We sat outside and had prime seating. The chips are unique where you can't stop eating them. The guac and salsa are excellent too. We ordered carne tacos and veggie- both delicious. There is something about their tortillas that keeps you eating! Fun drinks, fun place, great food- what more can you ask for?"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great atmosphere and good food! Tried some prawn tacos (highly recommended) and beef burrito, that was really good but it had so many sauces that killed a bit the tasty meat that was inside."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place is crackin' after 11pm on weekends. I went here with my friends for drinks and some of their bomb chips and salsa. We ordered apple martinis, long island, daquiris, and etc and a side of hot fries. the fries were SO GOOD! it was really HOT and warm!! The chips that came complimentary were just as equally delicious! I believe i had 2 baskets to myself. It was so yummy! We came at 9pm and left around 11pm, right before the huge crowd. however, one thing i didn't like is the 3 different music playing at the same time. couldn't listen to the music playing and it was just all loud white noise. Anyways, the crowd was great, a mixture of 20's , college, post college, older and etc. Not alot of people were dancing though, just like a few. They were super busy but our waitress was nice to ask if we wanted more drinks almost every 30min or so. The bathroom is clean which is a plus. there was a long wait and they do card you. Overall, great atmosphere and i heard their happy hour is unbeatable!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Horrible food - don't eat here unless you don't care what the food tastes like.... Stale chips, canned salsa, and a pound if pepper dumped on top of my fajitas. The place seemed very unclean."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Had the best bachelorette weekend at Sandbar! Jason Shotts and Arthur took care of my girls with a smile on their faces! Thanks for the hangover!! A must stop in Santa Barbara!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We were ther on 9/2. Great food, with a friendly staff. Make a reservation, as we did, the place gets very busy ! Reasonably priced. Patio on the street side is great for people watching. Excellent fish taco's. My only criticism is the pour on the glass of wine was  on the stingy side."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Came in for brunch this morning and had a great experience with heather as our server! Had such a great time that we moved to the bar and had a ton of fun with Roxie and Royce and ended up staying all day. Overall great experience and definitely recommend heading over for some food and drinks!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We ignored Sandbar for years thinking it was just a bar on lower State Street. Then one day we had friends in town and walked in to try their food because of the open air seating. The happy hour specials were great!  The food was absolutely delicious and authentic. Chips were warm and fresh and the salsa tasty.  

This weekend we went for breakfast to watch our favorite NFL football team. We were a little disappointed with the service. Many servers running around but not very attentive. The American breakfast food was decent the Mexican breakfast fare better. Love the ambience of the indoor outdoor seating.  I feel like I'm in Cabo when I eat here!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"If you're wandering State Street and undecided on a place to grab some appetizers and drinks, Sandbar is great for happy hour. There are so many different places to go to eat and drink in the area of downtown Santa Barbara so if you need a good compromise, you will definitely be satisfied. Half-off on specified appetizers and drinks. We stuck with a couple of drinks and also got some appetizers, where the portions are large enough to count as a meal, for a super good price, under $4. Started with chips & salsa, then we really wanted to try the guacamole, and it was to die for. Seriously one of the best places that sell shrimp quesadillas, and may I add that I'm obsessed with chicken taquitos, and they were the best I've ever tasted in a really long time.

The atmosphere is vibrant and upbeat with music, loud happy people (maybe even some amusing drunks - but that's fun), with pretty decent sized TVs scattered around the whole restaurant and bar. It's a super fun place to have some drinks with friends and catch up on some sports, or a fun hangout spot to meet new people and be in a laid back environment. A good first date kinda place, if you know what I mean. A couple of girls and I had the option to sit at a table with a booth like leather sofa with cute pillows on one side and chairs on the other. We were in elevated on an upper level which gave us a great  view of the rest of the crowd in the seating area. A good way to scout out cute boys, or cute workers (haha!).

If you're looking for a fun, vibrant, laid-back place to chill, have a drink, some good food for a good deal, then you need to come check this place out. I haven't been to the night club yet, but I have driven past it a few late nights, and it looks like it gets pretty wild and fun. You need to check this place out if you're ever in downtown Santa Barbara."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If you want to party and pay way too much for crappy food - this place is for you! The ""buy 1 get 1 free"" Happy Hour is dumb.. I'm trying to save money when I go to happy hour.. but their rule is that you HAVE to have 2 of the same drink at happy hour. So...... ok, when I ask for a Marg on the rocks, NO SALT.... the easiest way to make it.... I really hope next time they don't bring 4 with salt, and then ignore us for 30 minutes."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Came here for the first time this week. Our server Lucia was very nice and helped us pick out the perfect entrees. Service was very quick and food was very good but bring your appetite! Burritos are huge!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great place to spend a Sat afternoon. The Sandbar remind me of several bars in The OC. Yes, the music is loud and you are not going to get the best service, but it's just a cool place to chill and have a few beers. The prices are great and so is the people watching. We actually really enjoyed the chips and salsa, as well as the queso. If I lived in SB, this would be a place I would come to often.
BTW, the crowd does get a bit rowdy, as the day goes by."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great food! Casey took great care of our party of 5 with aplomb!!!! Will be back!!!
Virgin blended margarita was perfect for our daughter!
Muddled margarita was great!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The food here is fire. Situated between two buildings on lower State St., Sandbar is a restaurant/cantina which morphs into a club at night. Great for dinner, drinks, and birthdays! The space isn't large but there's lots of seating, some cool fire pits, and great atmosphere. If you want some value in terms of drinks, grab a ""Blackout Beach"" and split that thing with 2-3 people. The bar can be a bit crammed, but that's part of the charm."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Just finished a day at the SB zoo and decided to get a bite with my family, I might add that it was Mother's Day! They only had a few low tables that would accommodate us, being that we needed a high chair. The hostess was awesome and sat us as soon as one was available! The wait staff was super friendly and great! Service was fast and the food was really good! Good margaritas too!!! I thought that they might treat us second rate being that we were a family and this place was happening, but was very pleasantly surprised by how awesome they were!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,The Sandbar is one of the cooler spots on State Street.  Me and a friend happened to be in Santa Barbara on vacation during alumni week which resulted in a lot of the clubs being packed.  Sandbar was the spot everybody was saying would be the most fun and it was!! The DJ  was amazing and played a great mix of hip hop and R&B and pop.  They have a small dance floor but people just dance anywhere which makes it more fun.  The drinks are a little price but very strong so it's worth the $$.  Also if you can get there and eat before the club starts the food is delicious !!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Been here multiple times, all not the best experience. after I leave I always tell myself I am never going to go back but I always do. After this time I will not be returning. I was eating my taquitos and all of a sudden I feel something in my mouth.. and I pull out a BLACK HAIR (my hair is blonde). I get accidents happen and they brought me new taquitos but they did not comp anything for me, still had to pay for the taquitos.. very disappointed in this restaurant, will not be returning even when I am super drunk in need of a tequila shot.."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,First time here and it was such a great experience!! Our server Aliex made our visit worth every penny !! He was super helpful and had such a great vibe. Highly recommend this place if you're ever in the area!!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"On our last morning in SB, our group had a hankering for mexican. More over, all the alcohol in our systems required a hair of the dog only a spicy clad establishment could provide. Enter Sandbar.

This place is actually laid out pretty nice. Plenty of seating outside, good little bar area as well as two big tables they put together for our big group. This was a sunday morning that we came by. The place was relatively packed, considering they sat our party of 12. Lots of TVs showing all the games. We all had that ""I can eat a horse and drink the ocean"" faces on. At least those of us who could keep our heads off the table. Most everyone got a hair of the dog to straighten out. I ordered a bloody mary and the waitress let me know that Absolute was cheaper than the house vodka. That was nice of her. The prices for drinks were awesome. Pretty much happy hour prices. Then again, I'm guessing they were game day prices. 

The food was surprisingly good. I ordered the machaca and eggs. I'm sure that all the booze still sitting in my lower intestine contributed to the overall deliciousness of the meal. Nonetheless, I was very pleased with my food and my bloody mary. I'm definately gonna come back if we're in town again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Frequented Sandbar many a time during my summer in SB, usually around the witching hour. The music here is always great, there's space inside for dancing and the drinks are pretty good! It's very dark inside but the outside space is really cool, all fire pits and high tables. We reserved a table one night and we had chips and dip free flowing. Lovely cocktails, great staff."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Service is excellent had Heather as a waitress twice very efficient friendly and fun loving 

You can tell that the manager on duty Art keeps his staff having fun and taking good care of the staff

Food was very good had the enchilada and chile relleno with the queso fundido skillet appetizer 

Margaritas are also excellent"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Went today with my family and we had Lilian. She was AMAZING!! Super attentive and provided great service. Drink and food was delicious and came out promptly. We don't live in Santa Barbara, but we come out every once in a while. We will DEFINITELY return!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Wow.  Incredibly impressed.  The food was amazing but the service was truly incredible.  We got their names so that we could publicly thank Heather, Arthur, Lauren, and Luke for their amazing service.  They treated us like friends and guests and we left feeling full and very happy.  Our group of 9 all really appreciate it, so thanks to all 3 of you.  Next time we come to Santa Barbara I guarantee we'll be back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Fajitas were excellent. Queso fundido was awesome. Chips & Salsa were delicious. They were very accommodating to our large party with kids. Margaritas rock!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Came here for their mimosas during happy hour. They have 3 flavors: traditional, mango, and blood orange. I ordered the mango one. It was a bit too sweet for me and tasted like a regular mimosa. I also got the sangria and that was way better than the mimosa. We didn't really order food cause we already ate, but we got chips and guac, and that was good. Nice atmosphere and service was great. Will have to try their food next time."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I like the enchiladas. 

Fajitas are ok. 

Fruit flavored lemonades are good but regular lemonade is too plain. 

My sister in law didn't like the ceviche. 

Friendly staff and kid friendly."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I was craving Mexican food on my 30th and decided to have lunch here. The tacos were awesome, few things are better than fresh tortillas! The shrimp were plump and carne asada was seasoned just right. The mojitos are crisp and sangria had just the right amount of sweetness and tang. The staff was friendly and I even got a free shot. I will definitely return next time I'm in Santa Barbara."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Vibe is kind of lame here but they book good acts and I always have fun, Especially reggae night."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"When my wife and I visited Santa Barbara we were looking for a mexican restaurant on State St that had a fun atmosphere.  When we walked by Sandbar, it had exactly what we were looking for.  We made a reservation for later that night and went back to our hotel to freshen up.  Upon our return, the hostess told us that they were unable to seat us because their computer system was down and without the system they were unable to look up reservations.  I realize that computer issues happen in business, but not having a backup plan in case of these situations is poor management.  We asked the hostess if there was another mexican restaurant around and she let us to Baja Sharkeez.  (I realize this isn't a review for Baja Sharkeez but DO NOT GO THERE EITHER)

A night that was supposed to be a fun night with Mexican food with my wife turned out to be a disastrous dinner with drunk college kids due to Sandbar's poor management and failed systems."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Really really good food!!!!! Service is excellent!!!! Our server Jacob was very attentive, polite and funny :) thank you!!!!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,I love the steak fajitas...and love sitting around the big fire pit...but other than that the place could do better.  Chips aren't that great...and that's one of my favorite foods.  Happy hour is order one and get two drinks.  I'd rather just a deal on one because I don't always need two drinks.  It's a college bar so don't go there too late if you don't want that crazy vibe.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Last  month me and my family visited this restorant  and we got upset . We had very bad experience with one of ur waiter ( very unfriendly lady), food came late, service was not good at all. I do not think so, that we want to pay money again for this horrible costomer service"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The service and atmosphere was great. However, the food and drinks were quite lackluster. We had a salad, burrito and margaritas."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Yuck!  Everything was terrible - the guacamole, the drinks, the entrees.  The service fast (get 'em and get 'em out) but that worked for us as we were anxious to leave after such a bad meal."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Richie is the best bartender ever. And he is not too bad to look at. Just don't have him open an olive jar. Best time ever
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Went here before a show because we were hungry and wanted to be energized for our concert. However, after this experience, we will NOT be coming back anytime soon.

Our waiter was terrible and distant, he never introduced himself and never smiled, just stared at us to make an order. We asked him to come back in a few minutes and didn't come back for twenty minutes. 

We placed our order and I had carnitas tacos and chicken strips. The tacos were mediocre and there were only three tiny chicken strips. And by the end of the night, we received our bill and found that they had the audacity to charge me full price for the appetizers that our waiter said were on happy hour. Manager was ""generous"" enough to give us our discount but still. Terrible service, overpriced menu, mediocre tasting food. 

Giving two stars because our other waiter was very helpful and friendly, and the atmosphere is lovely. 

Go to Pascucci's or Lilly's Tacos if you want good food with good service and a reasonable price. NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I've come months ago when I was in town. Tonight the bar was pretty good. Tonight Jeremy was amazing and made the recommendation to mix the mango margarita with some jalapeño. Perfect for those that love to some heat. He had some good recommendations for those that prefer it mild as well.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Red is awesome!  This girl rocks. I wish every bar had a red. Her drinks are the best. Dirty martinis are not my ""jam"" but reds dirty martinis are bomb! She is a Rockstar"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great place! Really nice ambiance! Awesome margaritas! The chips & salsa & guacamole are to die for! The main courses are good. I've had better Mexican food but it was still worth a stop.  :)
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Very cool vibe and layout. Food is rather pedestrian and nothing to write home about. Drinks were weak and watered down at Happy Hour (perhaps that was the intent?). I'd go back for an adult beverage. Far better Mexican elsewhere in Santa Barbara.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,I'm only giving a one star so I am able to review place was horrible me and my fiance went to come here to eat after being referred from my hotel on the beach we get here and they have the audacity to tell us we cannot eat here because we have tattoos on our neck( mine is the anchor with my boyfriends name my boyfriend tattoo is of his moms name) the waiter couldn't even look at 7i when he told us we couldn't come in he settled for about 2 minutes with papers in front of him then told us we would not be able to eat there his waitress had almost a full sleeve yet the discriminate against us for neck tattoos o did I mention SOMEONE HAD A FREAKIN DOG IN THERE!!! An no it wasn't a service dog. The guy seemed embarrassed to have had to say that which he should be this was the 2nd place that did this. I hole they feel good about themselves an hope karmas a bitch for them. I drove 4hiurs to visit this place an I have many tatts an so does my fiancee an I can't even count the rude stares this city an these horrible bar/resterauntrestraints should b ashamed
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Awesome place !! Visiting Santa Barbara and happened to walk in. Only came for drinks and an appetizer. However we sure wish we had time to eat dinner! 

Drinks were great and our braised beef nachos were amazing!! Probably
Best nachos I've ever had. And that's saying a lot."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Good food and great atmosphere. Happy Hour 3-7 and reggae live music on Wednesdays. Great casual place to hang with friends. A bit in the pricey side for cocktails.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Visited them during happy hour Friday. It was really happy hour. great service, great food and  great drink. Try their nacho with chicken!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The food is not so great, but I do like the fire pit for hanging out. The one redeeming quality is their Perfect Margarita: it's literally the best on State. The rest of the drink menu...not so hot.

Not too much room to spread out, and it's usually pretty packed. They do however have some decent incentives for bringing groups, but you have to be aggressive and call several days before."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good place to get tasty snacks while drinking margaritas. The happy hour is great for 1\2 price apps. If you want a really good margarita stay away from the happy hour $6 ones. They have the crappy Jose Cuarvo. Get the house special margaritas with the premium tequila, those are fantasic. Also the handrolled chicken teqitos are amazing and cheap during happy hour. Service there was great and it was really busy."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. We've been to Sandbar many times before and everything was great from food to service. Today we went again with the family and place was awful. They put so much tables ( which was shaky and my husband asked for a coaster to put under a leg) around that there is no space to walk. Table was dirty and we asked 3 times to wipe it. Our waitress was a sleepy girl whom we asked 5 times for a napkins and never got ones , salsa and chips took her forever to bring( finally other waitress brought it). Drinks was brought up 30 min later with 10 min gap in between. Finally we ""caught"" our waitress to order the food which arrived on our table 1 hr 40 min later separately from each other. We complained to a manager. I don't think we will ever come back. For this restaurant is quantity over quality. Not the same one anymore"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Really enjoyed the whole experience!

Our server, Ali, went above-and-beyond, and definitely coming back!

The blended Mango Margarita was smooth yet strong, and their standard Margarita was just right, perfection; the food was amazing...

Had the shredded beef Taco, chicken Machaca Enchilada Y Relleno . . . not heavily salted, loved the enormous amounts of cheese, and couldn't finish it all through one sitting, but had to take the rest home... Great for munchies later, as that totally happened!

Boyfriend enjoyed his braised beef Enchilada too, he was jealous of my plate.

Thanks again, and looking forward to coming back!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"It took some huevos for these guys to do an open-air beach bar thing at this address because A) the beach isn't particularly close, and B) holy crap, can Santa Barbara be a frigid place to find yourself after sundown. But there's plenty of warmth available on the sprawling, dimly lit patio with the fire rings and the comfy chairs, and tequila has a knack for taking the edge off too. So Sandbar certainly beats hanging out in your living room.

This is especially true from 4 to 8 PM every day, which is a really generous time frame during which to throw a happy hour. At the risk of pushing this much-ballyhooed promotion into the highly overrated category, the two-for-one thing is a spectacular way to keep the rowdies coming back every evening. Order one drink, she brings two... it's twice the nice for you, the ol' pocketbook, and the local cab driver community. 

Unfortunately, the flaw for the casual drinker is that Sandbar has already peaked by prime time. By that point in the evening, you're left to contend with some pretty pedestrian food, loosely based on Mexican cuisine, that doesn't stand out unless you happen to do Ozzie Smith backflips every time you eat at an Acapulco. Also, laid back happy hour is often immediately followed in true bipolar fashion by phat beats drowning out your conversation while Melrose, Miami Beach, and the frat houses start pouring in for Santa Barbara's own MTV disco party. If you're not into the velvet rope scene, I'd be sure check the promotions schedule for the evening before you go. But meanwhile, if you're just looking to get a buzz going under the sun, or to get warm with some pals in the early evening, Sandbar is tough to beat."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Finally made it to the Sandbar!
Happened to be here the Saturday before Halloween and the whole crew was in fine costumed form. 

Our waiter, Jacob, did a great job by ensuring that our order got in quickly, accurately, and delivered to us tasty & hot!

I had the chicken enchiladas which were very good. Others at the table had a super burrito and a tostada - all of them given high marks. 

We'll definitely come back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I were in Santa Barbara for our honeymoon end of September 2014 and happen to see this place as we drove past it as we cruised up and down State St.  Looked like a fun place to eat.  The next day we were on beach cruiser bicycles and passed the restaurant again.  I suggested to my husband we eat there for dinner but ended up there later that afternoon for lunch.

I was immediately attracted to it from outside simply because of it's vibe.  It was full the times we passed by and just looked like a cool place.  By the name you don't really know what kind of food they specialize in.  Pleasantly surprised it was Mexican food.  Wish we didn't eat at a Mexican place the night before, but hey, we like Mexican food!  The food and drinks were good!

I really liked the contemporary hacienda decor and feel to the place.  Great outdoor patio setting complete with bistro patio lights.  The bar area was cool, inviting, spacious and had several tv monitors.  Actually sat at the bar later that night and had a drink while we waited for our table at the steak restaurant right next door!

If I were a local, I'd be there a lot!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Actually, not such a bad place at all.  This is situated on the strip of State Street.  Hopefully you found parking for the whole day because after shopping, head over to watch a game on their beautiful outside seating arrangements with couches and bartops or the Bar.  TVs everywhere, perfect for a game.  

Even better - HH everyday 4-7pm - Margs for $6 and the best money I have spend on a margarita yet.  they even have a skinny marg (150 cals) which is $6, but the server said to go for the original.  Other beers and wine are HH priced too - buy 1, get the second for 25 cents.  What a steal!  But the margs won me over.   Most HH apps are half off!  

It only gets better - complimentary chips and salsa - really good seasoned warm chips and perfect perfect medium salsa to help you sip the margarita down.  Free refills of chips and salsa of course."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"While up in SB for some meetings, I stopped in here to check out the Oregon/Auburn game. Tons of seating on the open patio. I liked the way they had it laid out with all the HD flat screens. It was tight on the inside but they had a lot of heat lamps outside. 

Lots of reviews that were hating on the fact it is owned by Sharkee's. Big deal.  The food was really tasty and the service was very prompt and courteous. Kristin took great care of me, even though she had no clue there was a championship game going on. 

Tasty big portions of fajitas, cheap happy hour dos equis on tap, good ambiance, lots of TV's.......I had a great time.  They lost a star because of the bathrooms.  I felt like a rat in the maze trying to find it.  Once inside, the door will wack you if you try to wash your hands.

Maybe five stars if Oregon won the game."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We came here on a Saturday night and got seated right away. Had a coupon for free house margaritas; wow, they were strong without being overly sweet! A very refreshing drink. Free chips and salsa were also served promptly and helped calm our super-hungry appetites. 

The dinner itself was delicious! We asked our waiter what he recommended, and on his advice we got the house fajitas (steak, chicken, and shrimp) and the build-your-own fish tacos. Really yummy and the dos equis we ordered complemented the food quite well.

There were just a few complaints though: if you are unlucky enough to get seated near one of the speakers blaring music, good luck hearing anything but the music! Also, when they get busy, the service level drops immensely. We had to wait about 20 minutes after we were done eating for the waiter to give us a box and the check. Would've been nice to have been checked up on more often."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If you are in college or want to relive those days this is the place for you.
I really didn't qualify for either on this beautiful day in SB but that is where we ended up.

On a positive note the happy hour has some great deals and the margaritas were OK. The chips and salsa is a pretty sad display of flavorless gunk, but I think most people just come here to get blasted.
It just wasn't one of those days for me - yes I was shocked too."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Walking down state street and this place was very lively. The food was good and the drinks were delicious. Service was good, which was unexpected due to how busy and loud the place was. Try the queso fundito as an app!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"It's was ok nothing crazy not strong, a 3 because of location. I had a house margarita and it was cool, nothing omg I need to come back. 

I didn't eat (I had plans elsewhere) but they do have lots of specials which is cool.

Good thing is that they are located on State Street strip which is cool for ppl watching.

I'm from nyc, so I feel like I've had better margaritas, I was expecting more in from Cali. I'm still hunting."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,I visited this place for my 21st birthday and I thought the ambiance was great! Beautiful outdoor seating with a really cool Spanish/Mexican theme going on. I ordered the strawberry margarita and my husband got the mojito. Really great drinks. The downside is that after we were seated it took a really long time for someone to come take our order and after we go our drinks the server just sort ignored us for the rest of our stay. We wanted to get some chips and water as well but he never showed up so we left. To top it all off the place was pretty empty so it's not like he was busy lol anyway; good drinks bad service.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great drinks... the Watermelon muddled was very refreshing. Fun atmosphere and GREAT happy hour food. We enjoyed it.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Sand bar is a fun place at night. Dinner is okay, the food could taste a lot better, but its got a good vibe and solid atmosphere if your grabbing drinks and appetizers. Good place to meet up with friends and start off your night. I used to come here a lot, but not as much anymore. They do have good happy hour specials and attractive people. I don't think I've ever seen a muffin-top at sand bar."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This is probably one the best place in Santa Barbara to hangout. I went there with friends and we sat outside to enjoy the atmosphere which is awesome, the food is delicious and margaritas are the best. The service is terrific and the staff is friendly and efficient, the first impression that we got was cheerful and pleasant: Willow, the host made us feel very welcomed and Ben, our server, was very friendly and attentive. I totally recommend this place!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Slow, unprofessional, and not qualified to check IDs. Never been treated so poorly.  Would not recommend."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love this place-- great outdoor tables, fireplace booths, and sports bar seating. I would recommend going during their happy hour (which I think varies on weekdays/weekends) because their drinks and smaller entrees are half-priced. Great place to have a couple drinks while people watching on State Street."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"It was my first time at Sandbar. I am sure every time I go to Santa Barbara, I will go and eat there. Great food and drink. The atmosphere was great inside and outside. You wont regret if you try it."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place is so fun! Been here multiple times for birthdays & the staff is great with big parties. 

Service: 5/5 every time I've been here. Our server the last time we were there was so great so S/O to Chelsea

Food: in my personal opinion it's kind of pricey but I'm a poor college kid. They have happy hour which is nice. But I've never had anything I didn't love (highly recommend the nachos de la casa)

Atmosphere: so fun all the time & great for big parties"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"BEST service I have ever had in a restaurant.  Shout out to Lilian and her manager!The food was delightful, our drinks were amazing, and the atmosphere was very pleasant. I will definitely visit this place again. And again;) I accidentally ordered something a little too spicy and they exchanged my meal no questions asked.   Five stars all the way. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal served by fantastic people."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Tarrah is the sweetest! She took care of us and our graduate! If you guys come here, ask for her, you won't regret it!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love the sandbar. This is just a great place to hang out and do some people watching, eat an appetizer or a full meal or just sit and have a beer or a soda and relax while friends can come and go and visit you if your local. You can either sit inside at the bar for communal conversation or out on the patio for a little shaded privacy or if you're like me you sit out along the sidewalk to get a little sunshine and do some people watching. The servers are always friendly and cute and the Decore has consistently changed over the years and is extremely comfy. I still remember back in the day when this was calypsos. The sandbar has come along way and I love what they're doing with it always. This is one of my local go to's when I just want to chill with a couple friends and chat."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came in on Monday August 5th, 2013 around 4:30 PM when seeing their happy hour menu outside with some great prices.

We sat down in the Cantina --- where the bartender explained happy hour and took our order. We got a Vodka / Tonic Double and a Pacifico along with Guac and Chips. The beers were cold (wish they would keep the 2nd one --- of the buy one; get the second for a quarter on ice instead of handing you both at once) and the drinks were stiff.

The bartender switched the channel over to the White Sox vs Yankees game at 5:10 PM without any issue and was constantly on point making sure we were well taken care of.

We came back later in the evening for International Night which was packed --- and a great crowd. I will definitely visit again when in SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is perfect for get togethers, casual or even a little fancy. The outside tables are the best... There are all different types of tables and heaters for when it gets chilly. The music here is all your current hits and as it gets later, the dance floor really gets going. The food is delicious...Last time I was here I had the cilantro carne tacos and they were SO good! And the margaritas are on point! This is honestly my fav place to join a group of friends for a fun evening out. I do not come to downtown SB without hitting up Sandbar. Can't wait to go back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Manager has no concept of customer service. Disrespectful and rude. As a local I will never return or recommend. Dropped $400 and had chairs removed from group by the manager. Enjoy at ur own risk. Severely disappointed and highly recommend another place.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My friend and I came for margaritas and appetizers, and were more than pleased with our decision. We ordered the fresh fruit muddled margaritas (strawberry), and they were delicious! They were recommended by the bartender, and did not disappoint. The chips and salsa were good--the chips had some seasoning on them to make them extra tasty. We ordered a chicken quesadilla as an app, and it was insanely good. We kept commenting that the chicken was probably the best quality that we'd had in a really long time. Definitely surprised us for a bar!

We sat at the actual bar inside, and the service was exceptional. It was a Saturday night on State Street, but the bartenders took everything in stride. They remembered orders, were super polite, and one bartender was even keeping an eye on people sitting at the tables. He would get on a Walkie talkie to let the servers know if it looked like they needed something. I'd definitely recommend this spot!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We went in for drinks.  The margaritas were fresh and flavorful, but not big, not strong, and not cheap.  The atmosphere, location, size, and staff were cool though (and the menu was the nicest I've seen, but nobody goes somewhere for the menu graphic design), so I recommend it."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good food for an extremly fair price. It was almost too much for us and we really hat some leftovers. But all in all, the food was tasty, service was excellent."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Too many drunken memories at this place!

I've only been there during their happy hour, so that means 2 for 1 margarita. I'll have to disagree with anyone that thinks their margaritas aren't huge, and full of flavor. ...I get buzzed off of one (but that could also be coz I'm a light weight) 
Anyhow, service is great, they have amazing spicy chunky salsa. Tacos aren't too bad either. 
Great if you're sitting outdoors feeling like a tourist. After you've gotten a bit of a buzz go across the street for some beer pong ..I think it's a bar called Revolution or something? You can't miss it, the beer pong tables are rather inviting!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great place to stop for happy hour! Drinks were delicious and the portions for the appetizers were filling. Chips and salsa are free at the table. The tortilla soup is not your traditional but in a good way. It's a bit spicy for those who can't handle the spice, but very good. Overall the meal was very good and you could easily share the appetizers during happy hour and be more than satisfied. Ambiance is great! 

Note for management: it seemed the kitchen couldn't get the orders correct. One table had chicken on their nachos, another table was supposed to have red sauce."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I went here on a Saturday night, and it was lively. BUT, the whole set-up/layout of the building is awful. I​ and my friends were dancing and we kept getting shoved/bumped into by staff. We weren't even standing near their kitchen or anything. We bought shots at the bar that were totally OVERPRICED and not even that good. And the cover charge was the worst part. I had to pay $5 just to experience this awful place?! I still prefer Sharkey's over this place.

1/10, won't recommend."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We would have given this restaurant a higher rating based on the food, but the service was lacking to say the least. When you dine out, do you like to go to places where the waiter takes your order and then takes a lengthy break at the bar right next to you instead of bringing you the chips you just ordered? Do you like to go to restaurants where a reasonable request (i.e. sweetener for iced tea, salsa for chips) is completely, repeatedly ignored? Do you like restaurants where the wait staff is more interested in loudly discussing their sex lives than bringing you your food or acting in at least a semi-professional manner?

If so, then come on down to the Sandbar!

All in all, this is one of the absolute worst dining experiences I have ever had anywhere. Let me back up. First, it was a hot August day and we requested seating on the patio, but we were told there was no seating in the shade. The only problem with this was that there was a shaded, unoccupied table two feet from where the hostess was standing. We were directed to the indoor bar. Our drink orders were taken and we were told we'd be given the complimentary chips and salsa one receives at any other Mexican restaurant ever. 

After bringing us our drinks and taking our food order, the waiter said he'd be right back with chips, salsa, and iced tea sweetener. He was right back... at the bar two feet away, taking his break and beginning a long discussion about his sex life with the bartenders. Some time later, one of the bartenders noticed that we didn't get our chips and asked if we'd like some. We said, ""Yes."" Did we get our chips and salsa yet? Nope! 

Our food arrived and we still had not received chips, salsa, or sweetener yet. Throughout the meal, we did not receive refills nor did anyone check in to see if we needed anything. We were the table that time forgot. 

Mind you, while all of this was happening, five people were ""working"" behind the bar tending to the needs of the three people sitting at the bar. There seemed to be no organizational rhyme or reason to who was supposed to help what tables (i.e. they shouted things to each other routinely such as ""Who's going to help Table 11?"" ""Who ordered the fajita salad?""). To say this place is poorly managed is an understatement. 

This is the first time in the history of going out to dinner with my aunt that I saw her decline to leave a tip. We are an easygoing Midwestern bunch that did not like being stranded on this sandbar."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The fajita salad is great, chips and salsa are good and caitlin the red headed bartender is the best bartender in santa barbara"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Went to Sandbar last night for a bachelorette party and had the best time! Arthur and the rest of the staff went above and beyond for us, giving us free champagne and a free ""special shot"" for the bride-to-be. The DJ was on point and seemed to be very good at feeling out the crowd and playing music to suit the audience. Great mix of new and old. Can't speak more highly about this place- go there!!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The food was okay , the front bartender guy with a hat was kinda rude - and seemed in a rush .... Not a very good impression"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great service, awesome ""perfect margarita"", killer shredded beef nachos and fun place to meet up with old friends and new."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place is a fun, friendly place! My friends and I went here for drinks and were taken care of by the absolutely friendly staff! The customer service is really what put it on the good side for me! 

I would absolutely love to go back to try their food!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"my best friend and i recently visited this dining establishment for dinner. we arrived during the later part of happy hour and were therefore able to take advantage of the $6 mixed drinks. the list from which to choose was not long, but the watermelon lemonade and another drink (cannot recall the name but it was similar to a blue Hawaiian without the blue color) from the list of 5 or 6 on the happy hour drink special list were nothing short of spectacular. they were super sweet and went down easily! 

what i loved most about this restaurant was the friendly and attentive service. Paulina, a hostess, pleasantly answered my questions about the happy hour/ dining deals before my best friend and i made our final decision to dine there.  our waitress, Rosie, gave exceptional service. she was upbeat, friendly, and very attentive and eager to please (but not in a phony way). she asked if it was our first visit, and we explained that it was, adding that we had initially planned to return to the steakhouse next door. she was delighted that we had elected to dine at sandbar and pledged to make our first experience a good one. she succeed and there was not a thing more she could have done to make our visit any more enjoyable.

the quality of the food was excellent and the prices were, we felt, outstanding, especially considering the restaurant is located on he main drag of an affluent area of southern ca. between the two of us, we ordered a chicken taco, a chile rellano, and three chicken enchiladas. 

a visit to sandbar on state street is highly recommended to satisfy your hungry tummy!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great service by Andrew the bar tender !!!!! The vibe and the chips and salsa were endless . Good times! TV's available for games! And good beers
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I cannot believe just how disappointed and dissatisfying I was with this experience. I spent $30.40 + a $5 tip HH margarita was IMPOSSIBLE to drink bc of the stupid fruit. The enchiladas have absolutely NO sauce on them. Beans look disgusting the rice was cold and old. The taco has more lettuce & cheese than it does beef. And the fact that I asked for chips and salsa with extra salsa and she tells me it comes with it; dude seriously this small little cup with 2 meals in it and you give a small cup?!? WITH an oversized side of chips?!?! I loved this place when I last went. I raved about it. Nope- not happy now!
Were going home tomorrow. Tonight we go to to bed hangry and really disappointed. Not cool!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,the bartenders there need to go back to school and learn math. sandbar overcharges just like sharkeez!!! beware !!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I live in Santa Barbara and I've been a sandbar many times in the past. But this is my first time there in a year or so. All I can say is WOW this place looks great, feels great, staff is friendly and attentive and the food GREAT! I had the Roasted Carnitas El Supreme Burrito for lunch today and wow that's a lot of food for little price, not to mention free chips and salsa !  Definitely going to come back here, again and again.  And best of all they have a buy five lunches get one free card!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Fun place with a good bar!  3.5 for food, 4.0 ambiance and 5.0 for service. Great for groups and partying. 

Nice vibe all the way around. Chicken machaca burrito supreme, carne asada and veggie tacos were all good.  The best part was the discovery of well crafted mixed drinks. Every bar can serve bottled drinks, but not all serve mixology with care. 

Swing by this place with confidence and enjoy the FUN and high energy!!   The ambiance is all comfortable casual, leather trimmed and fun focused. 

Order with confidence. I'll be back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Visited last Friday for lunch and loved the experience, the staff was very friendly,  the food was good and the outdoor seating was very comfortable.  The food was presented well and tasted even better."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"In town for the World Cup Opening Matches and have been trying different places for midday matches. We pleasingly surprised by the fresh and tasty taquitos . House Margarita was nothing special.  Raspberry Lemonade had a funny taste.
Setting was very nice, outdoors but with shade. Could have done without the flies.
Service was attentive without being annoying.   This place is probably pretty wild at night!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great Food!  Great service!
DUSTIN. Was Awesome
Ask for him when you go

He is Cute too

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We had a great lunch here . Nachos with braised beef were yummy. My watermelon Fresca margarita was perfect. The service team of Maray and Brian was quick, accommodating and courteous . Definitely will be back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The nachos here are the best I've ever had. During happy hour they are only 5 bucks. What makes them delicious is the seasoning they add to the chips. Also the pork carnitas tacos are sooooo good! Really recommend, the tortillas are so soft."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Friendly staff and quick service. Music not so great dance floor is ridiculously small. seating area ok, but not big as well. its an over all ""eh"""
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is fun! Sign-up with them for their offers and special events for even more.

I have never been disappointed dining there, whether dinner or lunch hours. It's great to sit and watch the world go by while sipping on a cocktail---mojito anyone?

The food choices are great SoCal/Latin.

Any needs we have are readily handled and manager Amber Heyer-Rasmussen handled a dilemma we had with great understanding leaving us without disappointment. 

If you are local, which I am not, there are lots of events they have and keep you informed of with special deals included.

I've been to Sandbar multiple times and will return next chance I get."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I was visiting Santa Barbara for work and stopped in for dinner. Definitely modern ""Cantena"" with lots of heaters on front patio (cool night) - great bar. The atmosphere was fun/young and service was very good. I thought the food was great. I had a chile relleno/chicken taco along with a couple Mojito's. I must say that the food was very ""fresh"" tasting. 
I'll return for sure if I have the opportunity."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Went for Brunch. They have a special before 11AM - $7.50 for a prefix meal and brunch cocktail - it was a great deal. The portions were large! We did enjoy our meal and had plenty of space (lots of seating)

Chilaquiles was not flavorful and seemed soggy. I wouldnt recommend this dish.

Only negative was that the server did not tell you about the special...and if you ordered a brunch cocktail before you placed the meal order - they did not want to include it in the special and bill separately. Manager involvement got this resolved but honestly wasnt our fault if we were not informed and manager also said they server should have told us but ""for future reference"" we should know this policy. This just seemed silly and something that should have been solved quickly without issue."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Super slow service at the bar on a Tuesday night.   Left before I finished my beer and ordered any food.   A star for the beer being cold.   Another for being on state street.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We were looking for a lunch restaurant in Santa Barbara after walking up and down on State Street.  We checked Yelp on the iPhone but decided to go with the restaurant with the most people and a good menu.  Settled on Sandbar.  They said no tables were open -- though there were some in the back within view -- so we could eat at the bar.  The bar was a bit of a hassle -- every time we wanted to order, we had to stand up and go talk to the bartender behind the bar.  When I go to a restaurant, I want to relax, not try to go order food.  The food was ok, nothing too memorable.  Margarita was good.  I was just irritated by constantly having to get up to order.  Even to get a refill on my drink, I had to go to the bar.  I ended up tipping 18% but I'm not sure why.  Prices were at least pretty good."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I went here for dinner and drinks last Wednesday evening.  It was a fun ending to what had been a beautiful day of celebrating our anniversary.  The waitress was very friendly, informative, and attentive; and another waitress also stopped by while we there, just to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  We visit Santa Barbara often, usually with our kids in tow, and had always wanted to stop by this restaurant.  The outdoor seating and cool-looking heat lamps have always caught our eye. ;)  We did sit out on the patio while we were there, and I noticed a good mix of just about anyone:  families, couples, older couples as well as college students and business people.  Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  The cocktails tasted great and were absolutely priced within reason (and I didn't even order off the Happy Hour menu ;) ), and we both enjoyed our dinners very much.  We'll absolutely be back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I went to Sandbar with a couple girlfriends because the bar looked nice from the outside. It turned out to be pretty crowded and there are a lot of older men by themselves. The food was plain, but the margaritas are decent. I would recommend going elsewhere to hang out with your friends."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Let's face it: service in SB is terrible. I attribute this to young college students that never had a job in service before and don't know what good service is. This place was no exception. 

We stayed for drinks and appetizers. The white sangria was ok. it was cool they had so many special tequilas. As far as appetizers, I make better guacamole and nachos at home. However, the party next to us looked like they were having a sweet dining experience. Their food smelled delicious. 

The bartender who served us was excellent about giving good information. It was happy hour, and if you don't read the menu carefully you won't get the special. He was cool enough to point this out to me. However, the bus boy took my drink away before I was finished. He made an assumption that because there were three glasses on the table that one of them must have been finished. A person in service should always ask."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Dropped in to show a friend from out of town the SB bar scene. The place was pretty full, but we found a great spot next to the fire pit. About 10 minutes later a guy came over asking us to get up because a party had reserved the seats next to the fire. Ummm.....what? No ""reserved"" signs anywhere, unlike the empty tables nearby. So when there are numerous empty tables and seats but a packed bar, where are we supposed to sit? Thank god I didn't order anything to eat because I would of probably ended up standing around holding my plate. Some other reviewer said this place had an older crowd but I'm 27 and I was probably the oldest person there. But this place is great if you just turned 21 and don't know any better about where to spend your money and time on a night out!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"$2 bloody mary's on Saturday? Yes please!

Funny our server casually forgot to mention this fact (we realized it only after we got the bill), and was pushing pricey margs on us instead. They also apparently had a breakfast menu which was conveniently not offered to us either.

Luckily I got my post-train ride brunch fix thanks to breakfasty-sounding burrito, which according to the menu could be served smothered with red sauce, cheese AND guac for a small charge. Wo hoo!

Burrito comes out smothered, but sans guacamole... hmmm. I ask our server, and she seems a bit bewildered and brings me a side (which I was charged another $2 for). No biggie, but the menu was either not well written or the kitchen messed up.

The refried beans are lard city and kind of tasteless but not a deal breaker and my fellow hungry diners enjoyed the tacos and drinks so no love lost.

Mid-meal, my friend thought her second bloody mary was too spicy and politely asked to have it remade. Our server offered a long-winded explanation as to why the second drink was different than the first, and rather than having it remade, told my friend to order a totally different drink. Um, OK? Funnier still, the bill listed ""customer complaint"" as the reason it was taken off the tab. I've NEVER seen that printed on a bill!

Overall a good time despite the hiccups and the setting was awesome- huge open patio right in the middle of State St.! Apparently it used to be a car dealership in the 30's (fun fact courtesy of my now local friend)."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We had a very laid back, dinner focused wedding reception, so we wanted a place to really party for our after party.  This was perfect for our group 20 or so people (ages early 20's-late 30's).  It was the right mix of dancing and it was great because we had a whole area to sit and drink too.

We reserved an area/table and it only cost us 1 bottle for bottle service.  What was great about this place was that everyone could also order from a cocktail waitress and start their own tab.  There was also no cover for our group and we got to skip the line when we all arrived.  

I loved the indoor/outdoor vibe of this place.  We all really liked the music/dj.  

Amber, their event coordinator, was such a pleasure to work.  Service and staff were really nice too. My husband lost his keys and id somewhere on the dance floor and he talked to security and they went around with flashlights and looked for it and found it while we were still there that night.   

It was a great after party location and so much fun!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We discovered this place while walking around Old Town Santa Barbara on a nice Spring day.  There are dozens of places to eat along State Street, but we kind of liked the look of this one, and we like Mexican food.  Most of the seating is on a covered patio, but we took a table in the bar  It was a little windy and cool outside for us.  The place has a nice menu with most of the typical choices for Mexican.  Both my wife and I had a combo platter with an enchilada, a taco and a rellano.  Everything was very good.  The Chili Rellano was one of the biggest I have ever seen on a plate, but the chili was very mild and they didn't skimp on the cheese.  We found the overall quality of the food very good and they serve plenty of food too.  The service was a tad slow, but it was mostly because we were in the bar and the bartender was also our waiter, which meant he had to come around the bar to serve us, not the ideal situation.  I can see a bartender waiting on customers actually at the bar, but not at tables away from the bar.  Not the best Mexican I have ever had, but decent at a reasonable price considering the tourist area."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Nice spot for people watching and drinks in Santa Barbara. My husband and I stopped here after attending the art festival. We had margaritas and nachos, and they were pretty good!  They let us keep our dogs just outside the patio area, so we could still see them. The service was good, and we enjoyed the atmosphere."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I have never written a review on Yelp before but Jason Shotts at Sandbar has given us such IMPECCABLE service and attention for my girlfriend's bachelorette weekend that I can't help but write one. He was SO sweet, such a gentleman and took care of us for two nights!!! We definitely came back the second night after he was so nice to us. He even went out of his way to hold our coats for us in the back while we were dancing and gave us all water bottles at the end of the night and made sure we were all okay. The second night he reserved us a nice table around the fire pit and continued to be incredibly professional, polite and gave us superior service!! Will definitely come back again with more friends next time I'm in Santa Barbara! Thank You Jason!!!! You made my friend's bachelorette weekend and our night :)))))))))"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Overall, my experience at sandbar was somewhat disappointing. I went there last night to celebrate my 21st and have some drinks during happy hour with friends. Service was terrible! My server, Katie, vastly ignored my table and when I ordered one beer but changed my mind on what I wanted, I went to the bar to let her know. She said okay but brought me the original beer type I had ordered and then never brought me the other kind I wanted. When she told me that type was not a happy hour special, I said that was fine but I wanted it anyway. I never got that beer.... The food was good and fast to arrive. Thankful for the good prices! Wish I had a better time. A 21st birthday makes it very easy for a server to up sell expensive cocktails or other mixed drinks. Katie didn't even try, which made me not want to order anything from her. I would have loved to have gotten a speciality drink but nothing was recommended so I just didn't think about it anymore. 

Overall, I will come back for the food, but hope to have better service next time and definitely would not recommend someone go there to celebrate a birthday or anything else."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Good Foo Great service  Enjoyed sitting on outside patio.  Relaxing. Completely contentedly eating
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good food, good deals, but the friendly staff sealed the deal. Got us in off the street with a welcoming smile and a friendly greeting. Chase and his team made it an easy choice on a street full of them. Will return next time I'm in SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Me and the bf went here for dinner while visiting some friends last weekend. We sat on the patio which was really nice and relaxing. The only down side is people smoking, I hate smoke blowing in my face while I try to eat dinner. I had the chicken tacos which were either really good or I was just really hungry. I also ordered the Fresca Margarita, which was not so good. That seemed to be the consensus of the group, good food not so good drinks."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The place is kinda cute, I have to admit and walking down State street, I was intrigued so my boyfriend and I went there. First impression didn't last. 
The place has too many loud, obnoxious people. Our waitress got our order wrong. She took forwever to get our bill because she was too busy flirting with male customers. The food wasn't good. We ordered beef enchilada. The tortilla was not fresh and it tasted that it has been left out in the air to dry. The shredded beef was too tough and chewy. The flavor was not at all impressive. 
When we left and reached the corner of the street, I heard a few people talked about how they don't want to go to the Sandbar coz the food sucks. I wish I heard that before we went into that place. One thing for sure, we're not coming back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"great prices, good vibe, sat outside at nice table, server Awesome Austin was prompt & attentive & informative."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ok. Monday afternoon and we were cruising state street after a lovely weekend in Santa Barbara and found this place. 

It was a great find for what it is. Actually it was better then what we expected it to be! Amazing fish, Pescado Del Dia, and ceviche - we even love the free chips and salsa. The chips were thin and warm and lightly seasoned. The salsa is homemade, which is not what we expected when we discovered it. The staff was good, sweet natured and friendly. 

Sitting out doors on state street - this is an exemplary Santa Barbara cantina with great tequila and probably really hops on the weekend!!!!! 

Great happy hour from 3-7 pm Sunday through Friday."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is packed on Thursday nights because of their 3-for-1 drink deals. Three well drinks for the price of one?! Best deal in Santa Barbara. The bartenders are attentive and I appreciate that the drinks aren't watered down. There's not a lot of places to sit, so be ready to stand for the most of the night. Bathroom lines are reaaallyy long because they have only one bathroom per gender.

I've heard the food here is pretty good - can't wait to come back to try!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"It was fun!  The food was good enough - not the best but enjoyable!  The Happy Hour deals were wonderful.  The male waiter was attentive enough but didn't give his all - just too busy.  If you are looking for a fun night out with tons of noise and people, then this could be a good fit for you."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Real good food,very good service ( they were busy as hell on a Friday night and it was happy hour) and very reasonable for Santa Barbara. We just finished a long bike ride and wanted to find a place  to have a few drinks and eat dinner..what a nice surprise. I wish I could remember our waitresses name because she was great. I tipped her on the way out and thanked her for the effort. Best stop on the trip."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great margaritas and food from here. The ambiance can't be overlooked either, I love it. It's very bohemian and cool. I removed one star because half our chips (the bottom half) were smashed to bits and seemed like from the day before. Hot, fresh ones were on top. We ate the good ones then asked for more, but they just topped us off, even though they could see we weren't eating the crumbled pieces. Also, their happy hour used to be 7 days a week. Now it is Sunday-Friday. Not on Saturday, which is the day we were there. Since I'm from Phoenix, that might be an old change, but I still saw the old happy hour menus on yelp, so I didn't know. It was a disappointment. We would have ordered way more if happy hour specials were going on."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Lunch stop on the way up the coast! Dog friendly patio which is a must and great choices in seating! Quest fundido on par! Chips and salsa ok.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My GF is a midwestern, duh, Cardinals fan, and we cruised State Street for a pleasant place to watch (according to her) a major play-off game involving her Bird Team, and hopefully, for me, some guacamole, a handful of fun-looking adults, a passel of happy-go-lucky wait staff, and maybe a cocktail or two. We'd zzumbaed on up from Los Angeles for a weekend of fun.  The other Sports Bars along State Street had their TVs going on and the Cardinals game, too, but in those more divey bars, the children ranged from 19 to 24, and our demographic is over-educated, outspoken, and a bit older than the current crop of UCSBers..  Only slightly.  And we seriously style Donna Karan and Steve Madden, not flip flops and short shorts.  What's the matter with these hedonistic college kids? They're adrogynous and apolitical.  I, for one, while in college, burned down Banks of America and stopped attending classes because we didn't like our boyfriends having to fly off to Cambodia!  

     Sandbar is a gorgeous indoor/outdoor space.  The wait staff were just adorable and funny, too!  There's brick and wicker and plants and TVs and amusing cocktails.  You do not go here to worry about gourmet cuisine.  You go here to people watch, hang out, enjoy decent fajitas, and laugh and gossip and tell tall tales.  I lost interest after the 4th inning, but my shameless flirting with groups of male peacocks @ other tables kept me occupied.  Who knew baseball games took so looong?  9 innings, really?  Why?  Loved the vibes here. Oh. The Cards won.  I'll be back with the remainder of my social group, the real divas of so ca.  Fah sure."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Worst service I've had in a bar in a long time!  The only positive thing i can say is that the atmosphere is good. Go to madison's across the street. They have 2 for one happy hour and much better service.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Yes yes I'm a fan - BUT ONLY of their Happy Hour. Their Happy hour is everyday from 4 to 8 and offer 2 for 1 drink specials and 1/2 on their appetizers - which are not bad. The only thing that is really bad here is the service....its like I always get a new girl or something  -____-   but I keep coming back for their damn happy hour. Ive also made occasional stops on college nite, since this place does turn into a club at night."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Stopped here mid-week late afternoon. The food people were eating on the patio looked good. Had some interesting menu items I had never seen at a Mex restaurant before, salads, etc. Had some non-Mex kid menu items for fussy eaters like fries and chicken strips. Had a burrito where the server asked if I would like rice and beans with it on the side...that was an extra $3 when the bill came. The top shelf margarita was excellent. When happy hour came we got 2 for 1 margaritas but opted for the ""house"" tequila which left a medicinal after taste in the drink...blech! Food was okay. Chips were funky, sprinkled with some kind of seasoned salt. We ordered a side of guacamole and chips and those chips were really stale. Should have went to Chipotle...cheaper, fresher, etc.  Waitress took good care of us though.  Don't know who the guys were, bussers or waiters but they were a little unfriendly to deal with."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I absolutely love the ambiance of this place...so vivacious and fun!  Great drink specials and bartenders were very attentive...
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ryan was the most attentive waiter I have ever met. He was fun, knew the best insider menu and made our every dream come true. If you come, find Ryan. He'll literally light your fire, fill your glass and if you're nice, the salsa will flow"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Nicholas is the best bartender here. The blended Miami vice is amazingly refreshing! I wish they could clone him to work 7 days a week. The fajitas are on point as well! Check out reggae night on weds!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place had the worse service ever. 
Let me start out with trying to make a reservations. I went out their for my sister wedding which was to be on July 13. I wanted to reserve a table for 10 ppl, I called on July 7 to reserve a table over the phone. I was then directed to go online for reservations. I was like ok fine no problem, made my reservation was then instructed by online that I was going to receive an email to confirm reservation. I called the next day to explain my situation and was tolled I was going to get a call back which I never did.
July 9 called again and was tolled the same thing by a second female that said I was going to receive a call about my reservation by manager Jim or jimmy she said, still no call back. July 11 heading out to Santa Barbara, upon my arrival after my check in I then called again and was tolled they where going to have my table ready. I didn't like the fact that I had to call repeatedly to confirm my reservation. July 12 I show up with my guest was tolled that they only had a table for 4 I was a upset. I explained to my guest our situation and was tolled they where going to give us another table next to they 4 seat they gave me. I now have 6 ppl standing an 4sitting for an hour. Ordered 2 beer and 3 micheladas. The worst tasting micheladas of my whole existence. I am now frustrated I ask to speak with the manager whom never bother to come out. I ask repeatedly to speak with manager jimmy was tolled he was busy. I swear ppl I wanted to burn down that place I ask for my bill and was charged an additional tip of 22% and my appetite was destroyed. I had to take my guest to sharkeez baja grill in which I have to say thanks to then they made it happen with great drinks and offering to seat all my guest together after I had explained my situation at sandbar or should I say sandbag.
As for sandbar  
#1 reservations suck balls.
#2 worst service in all of state street bars.
#3 to the Jim or jimmy what ever your name is as a manager you are something else. How were you even promoted to manager!!!!!!
Them knee pads are working out great for you...........

I hope you pay a big buck to remove this post...."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"So came to SB to visit for the weekend and ended up at this place 3 times in 2 days. Fun place to go out with friends and the food was good too! The manager Art, was also great he made sure we were all doing alright and having a great time! Extremely courteous and professional! Will definitely be coming back here again!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"great place to get some grub on. theres plenty of drinks to be had and the  bar is a cozy little place to start off your evening. plenty of eye candy as well and the staff are cheery and accommodating. bonus points for patio dining  

did i mention theres tons of flat screen t.v.s for those fight nights. fun place to watch the ufc and they dont charge cover to see it not like those other bars down the street.grr!"

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The food was mediocre at best, but the experience was truly bad because of the horrible service!  We waited what seemed like an eternity for the clueless waitress to accomplish the simplest of tasks.  Even the busboy couldn't bring water and/or chips... Where do they find these incompetent people?  The confusing happy hour menu apparently only applies if you sit inside next to the toilet, otherwise you pay full price... of course we were told this AFTER the fact... It's a shame, because this place looks fun from the street, and has potential to be a great restaurant, if only they actually cared about customer service and reasonably priced food...  i'm glossing over all the problems that we had... i would not go back or recommend it to anyone."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The place is nice but that's all. The food was ok but not the best & the service was so slow. I will not recommend this place if you are looking for good service & delicious food. Otherwise, just do (drinks) HH."

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Weak. 

The only thing they have going for them is a half-open patio where people can hang out and smoke. 

Other than that...eh.

Couldn't spend more than an hour and fifteen minutes there, let alone 2 hours. 

Dance floor is small and crowded. 

DJ did not take requests...seemed too drunk to spin."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great place to eat Mexican food in Santa Barbara.  Is it white washed? a little,  but what do you expect from Santa Barbara's State Street.  Does it have great favor? Yes.  My husband ordered the shrimp tacos. Yum! they came with hand made yellow tortillas and the combination of the shrimp, their sauce and cotija cheese, they definitely where worth the visit.  I ordered and a fried shredded beef taco, shredded need was delicious,  and their Chile relleno was a version similar to a beer battered Chile relleno, very crunchy.  It was very good to my surprise. I would come back. FYI- They have happy hour from 3pm-7pm."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,My girlfriend and I drove to Santa Barbara for a concert this week and has the pleasure of eating dinner here before the show. It was recommended by our hotel concierge and SandBar did not disappoint! Our server Dustin did an exceptional job explaining the menu and even making recommendations. We will definitely be back and make recommendations to friends and family! Cheers.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"If you're looking for an awesome brunch spot, Sandbar is a surprisingly great choice. Their Huevos Rancheros has a deliciously authentic ranchero sauce and a lovely jalapeño cream. Poached eggs are perfect, and 2-4-1 brunch drinks! The outdooor patio is perfect for people watching, and staff is super friendly."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This is my second review of this place.  Unfortunately it's gotten a little worse.  I had high expectation (it being V-day weekend and I brought my beautiful lady).  We are both of Mexican heritage and enjoy our Mexican food.  

This time the chips were served cold and the salsa was not the same salsa I had the first time around--it was sweet like clamato instead of tomatoes--but they did bring a diablo salsa out after we asked about it, it was not much better.  

I ordered the chile relleno with chicken enchilada.  Now, the chile relleno was very, very good, despite the fact that they used some sort of crispy batter...but hey, I liked it very much.  The RICE...WOW, just like HOME.  That was amazing, since rice anywhere is rarely like home.  Now, I hate white beans and black beans, they didn't have pinto beans...so I just got more rice. I WANT PINTO BEANS.  

Now, for their biggest Faux Pas was that my chicken enchilada was on the verge of being very, very good except they did like almost all restaurants do, they didn't marinate the meat in the sauce, they instead put the sauce over the tortilla.  It's always better to cook the meat and the sauce together.  They most likely do the same with mole, pouring the sauce over a plane cooked chicken breast. Doing that leaves the meat tasting bland or dry, even if the sauce is good.

Anyway, my lady had seafood enchiladas...this was a fail.  Completely.  I have no input, I'm not a fan of seafood enchiladas; but there did seem to be way too much garlic--garlic not being a strong ingredient in Mexican food.  

But, the margarita's were still on point :)  And, still loved the atmosphere.  :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic deals.   Love the happy hour: buy one get one for a quarter.

Employees all worked together to make us feel welcome, even with a party of 12 and our complicated orders. 

Josh benson was very very understanding when a few things didn't come out on our picky orders.  

I completely recommend this place"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Bad, slow servise.. Food was a 3 star.. Service was a one star... Waitress couldn't split a check 3 ways either.. I would strongly avoid this sub par reseraunt  if at all possible. 

I came here off my ship to get some food, aaaaaaaand I should have kept walking. 

Do not go here.

Ps..

The mimosas are horrible too"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,This is one of my favorite places in town! Tarrah is amazing and always hooks it up! Best music and vibes!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Service was good and food was delicious.  The reason for the 4 star rating was my wife asked for sour cream on side because she doesnt like it and I do.  After waiting for a good amount of time our meals arrived (seafood enchiladas).  Sour cream was on both plates when it should have only been one.  The server did ask us if she wanted it remade but we said no since it took so long to get our food in the first place.  Another thing was the beans and rice...the serving size was so small it literally took is only 4 forks full and it was gone.  Never been to a mexican restaurant where they skimped on beans and rice.

The atmosphere was awesome and our server was good.  If my wife and I are ever back in town we would definitely come back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love Sandbar, it's the perfect place to just chill and hang out with your friends while enjoying a drink or a meal. 

Every Sunday from 9am to 11am they have the special brunch deal where you get an alcoholic drink + brunch entree for only 7.50$! Best brunch in town! Must check it out!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Great atmosphere but disgusting dirty wine glasses. We sent back a drink in a dirty glass and it was re-served in a wiped out dirty glass. If something that simple is very wrong how is the food?
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came here after a work meeting on a Monday evening.. Couldn't have been more of an excellent experience. Friendly hostess, fantastic bartender (thanks, Shotty!), delectable steak tacos,  and of course, a few nice drinks.

The drink a coworker and I shared was the Blackout Beach; nice way to kick off our happy hour. Everything was decently priced as well. Will be back in the future when in the area."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great location, great happy hour drink prices, and food was plentiful!  The fish tacos were awesome and so was my watermelon lemonade cocktail. Try the chicken nachos, you won't be disappointed!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Good food. Great atmosphere. Really nice staff. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We were here this past week as part of a road trip and boy did it deliver. Best guac I've had hands down (don't tell my girlfriend who makes a pretty mean one).  The enchiladas were also incredible.  The place has a really cool ambiance with string lights and heat lamps and bartenders are super friendly. Ours was named Mike, who was extremely engaging and was doing an excellent job taking care of customers on a pretty busy night. We stayed for about 4 hours and I would do it all over again!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"i came to the sandbar about a week ago with a friend. we were very excited to come here for happy hour. as we see a very comfy booth we were told we could only sit in a certain area for happy hour?, so we ended up sharing a table with strangers!. their happy hour is buy one get on for a quarter. the margarita was good. we also ordered food which was also good. as we are close to finished with our food we are kinda waiting on our 25 cent margarita.. never got it! ... then the guy who attended us asked if we were all finished so he can close our tab or hand it over to another person bc he was taking off the day. we told him we were all finished and as he brings us the receipt of course they charged the 25 cent margaritas that we NEVER got.... not coming here again thats for sure"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Wouldn't let our party of 4 in because my friend had baggy jeans.  Totally rediculous.  We were dressed nice and would have spent money.  Lame.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Yet another stop on my epic SB santa pub crawl. 

Most of my time was spent here with a lovely server named Cassie taking care of us. Subsequently, we ordered too much food and too much beer. With a little help from some friends it was all destroyed in a style that would make BA Baracus proud. 

By the time we were ready to leave a line had formed out in front and I think they may have been charging cover? If so, that kinda blows (esp for a college town) but I have to say A-Ok because I had a swell time here (and I didn't pay cover, hah!)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,the fajitas sure do smell good. the ambience totally works for me. chips (so so)
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great service and food. Build your own dish taco very good. Location is great for people watching especially w some Dos Equis and Salsa.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I would certainly recommend this place - a head above the rest due to their great wait staff who give amazing service. From the host to the hostess to the manager to the waitress, everyone seemed trained in 5-star hospitality and seemed eager to exercise it. 

When we first got there, we waited a little for a table, and the host kept talking to us and thanking us for our patience. At our outdoor table (it's mostly an outdoor restaurant) I was too cold there and they had already expressed that they were pretty full. I decided to ask to move and was walked through a few options which included going over and testing the temperature of the table that was under the roof. It was great, right near a heater. But it was the WAY the staff spoke to us - not too ""over the top"" - very kind and reassuring: ""I just want to make sure you're comfortable and that it won't be cold there, either."" So nice. 

We were trying appetizers at a few different restaurants and decided to get something small here. We both ordered the Baja Style Fish tacos (it's in Spanish on their menu). Wonderful. The breading it was fried in was a little too thick, but the flavours of the whole taco, esp. the handmade tortilla, were great. 

My husband said something I'd like to pass on: 'It's not really a Mexican place' the way it's advertised to be. I think it is, but like, a new, hip, modern Mexican feel. Just so you know.

Have fun! Go Sandbar!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Went here for lunch with my girlfriend. Excellent drinks, and huge, delicious portions. I had the Pork Carnitas Burrito and I fell in love...
The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the service was a little inconsistent. They were helpful one minute, and then non-existent the next. Overall, we got exactly what we wanted, and the service was good enough, and the food was EXCELLENT."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Some friends and I strolled in, just wandering around downtown. And we ended up spending the entire day here! The bartenders are AMAZING! Especially Amanda- wow!!! She was welcoming, and had wonderful drink suggestions. I would definitely suggest coming here and ask for Amanda!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We love Mexican food and the Sand Bar lived up to our standards. We sat outside in the courtyard and loved the ambiance. The happy hour special of 2 for 1 was perfect for a Friday evening. I ordered the steak fajitas and they were very tasty. My husband had a burrito. We both liked what we had and would go back again! The one downside was the bar service which seemed to take forever. We ordered our 2nd beer before we finished the first so that it would arrive when we were ready for it. It was a holiday weekend, so we think that was the challenge!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,The happy hour here is really great! Buy one drink and get the second for 25 cents. My bartender Jeremy took really great care of me and told me about reggae nights on Wednesdays. I came back Wednesday night and the band was really fun.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I have to say, this rating is based on their tequila and beer selection only! I am very particular about Mexican food, and it didn't look appetizing to me. It seemed very much like Acapulco chain style stuff. However, their tequila selection was fantastic! If you enjoy sipping on delicious, melt in your mouth, like honey going down your throat tequila, this is the spot!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If there was a lower rating than one star I would give Sandbar it. My friends and I, a group of 20, went to Sandbar this past Saturday and had a terrible experience. As soon as we walked in a few of us sat down, and some went to the bar. The ones that sat at a table did not get served until about 10 minutes of waiting. As soon as our server came up she had one of our friends kicked out immediately with no explanation, and did not even ask any of us for drink orders. I went to the bar and the bartender was not friendly to me either, and multiple friends felt the same tension from the associates as well. Before we left a friend and I wanted to speak to the manager to let him know how we felt and how we were mistreated. The manager completely disregarded everything we said and did not apologize once. The bartender later apologized to me and my friends when we had left, which was a nice gesture and I appreciate it. But honestly I will never go back to Sandbar and give them my service."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Slow service and the drinks were below average. Nice outdoor patio seatings though. Place turns into a club just like every other places on State st.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I walked by on a Monday afternoon much to my surprise to see a packed patio. Sat at a fun high top all by lonesome for some good people watching. I watched the manager defuse a vocal old man ""who hated the mild salsa cause it was too hot and tell a young European girl she would get a ticket for smoking"". Yes santa Barbara is a smoke free zone, but they can't do anything about assholes. The manager kindly handled a volatile situation. The service was great. Greeted with a smile and two servers and manager, I promptly ordered a sandbar margarita which they deserved to drink too, maybe more than me. I told the manager the salsa was great, but it was definitely not hot.  I was then served a smoky hotter version, the diablo, which was tasty and should  be served regularly. I ordered the carne asada Chile relleno and it was cooked to perfection. I'd come back tomorrow if I could."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We stopped here after booking on open table and were concerned after seeing the yelp rating but...this place was amazing. 

The fish tacos, steak tacos & rice/beans were exactly what we had been searching for as we drive the PCH! 

The service was great on top of the food.  

All in all, we will absolutely be bookmarking this for our next trip through the city."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This is not an establishment I would visit. My fiancee and I wanted to make reservations because we are getting married in Santa Barbara and wanted to celebrate our night with great music and food according to the reviews. The issue: we do not drink. Just because we are non drinkers does not mean that we are not allowed to enjoy and spend out money on food and non alcoholic drinks. When I said that we are non drinkers-the emails to make reservations ceased. So because we are not the kind to get wasted and would rather be sober to enjoy our wonderful time in a city we have never been too and will be celebrating a moment in our history, our money isn't good enough for this business. OK fine, thank you for letting me know what you think about customers and I will make sure to enjoy Santa Barbara without this business. We made our reservation elsewhere.

Sandbar, discriminate much??"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My absolute favorite place to eat at in Santa Barbara! The food is delicious, they give you a great amount of food, the atmosphere is super fun, and the service is ALWAYS excellent. :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Chips and salsa come to the table as you are seated.  

I ordered the veggie mercados (veggie tacos).  Came with three for $7.25
The tortilla was authentic and delicious and the veggies were superb."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Thought we would splurge for our 2 year wedding anniversary; from the chips and salsa to the wild berry mojito. The sandbar was delicious!! I cad the carne Asada plate with chile relleno and a salad with citrus lime vinaigrette ; yum. Service was a bit slow but we sat out in the patio so we didn't mind relaxing in the sun!! Was here about 12:30 in the afternoon before it got too busy!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Tacos were very good. Reminded me of my early days on revolution street. Good happy hour. manager just handed me two free drink tickets for my next visit!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"My wife and I stopped in for lunch. After serving our drinks, no complementary chips, we ordered a burrito to split. Finding it somewhat dry, we asked for some grated cheese. The bar tender bought some after advising us there would be a charge. We said o.k., figuring maybe 50 cents or so.

Imagine our surprise when we got the bill, and found that they charged us $1.49 for a cup like you would fill with ketchup at a fast food place!

When I asked about this the bar tender simply said, ""I just work here"" with a shrug.

Needless to say we won't be back. Oh, and I guess I should also mention observing another bar tender wiping his face on a bar towel, then wiping up the bar with the same rag."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came in on Saturday day with my family for some afternoon Mexican food. Ordered some burritos, tacos, and drinks. The sangria was delicious! Also want to shout out Alex and Katie! They provided us excellent service and made it a memorable experience for us! They accommodated our party of six without hesitation. Thank you sandbar!! P.S. the shrimp tacos are amazing :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"-Happy hour sucks, being charged full price for drinks that are on the happy hour menu, AND had been purchased previously for happy  hour prices.
The bar tender was a jerk, telling us not to order from him, although our waitress was NEVER around to order drinks from.
The dumb girl sat us down without a menu. Then comes to take our order 20 min later, only to realize we can't order!!
The food sucks, the girls who work there aren't very friendly, and overall it's just not a fun place to go.
Unless you're into being a bro and over spending on bland, gross, mexican food."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"For $50 I got a perfectly mediocre fish taco, a decent (but how can you screw it up) enchilada and a very weak large margarita.

You do not get what you pay for here.  The food is very bland and the drinks over priced and weak.  

The ambiance is what drew me in, however there was nothing more than decor to this place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I give this place 10 stars! Talk about an epic bachelorette party venue! Charles and his team were fantastic! Every little detail was impeccable and they were so much fun to be around. We are going back tonight.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Bartender was only saving grace.  The whole restaurant is a patio.  It was cold.  Took 30 minutes to get a working heater.  It was 5 min till happy hour and server refused to put in the order early.  We had to wait to get our happy hour drink!!  But The Bartender helped us out and hooked is up though.  Could have been an off day at Sandbar, but not impressed!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar was everything we could have asked for during our bachelorette fiesta! Jason really made sure we felt safe and secure but also showed us a great time!! The experience was so fantastic, both of our going-out nights were spent at Sandbar! Thanks to Jason and the Sandbar team for helping out our bride squad!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"WORST Mexican food EVER!  If you are looking for a  college watering hole with cheap drinks, fun atmosphere and lame service, you have the right place.  My wife and I are self admited food snobs and went here for the great patio and figured because it was packed it must be good food...NOT!  The fish tacos were horrible, the refried beans tasted like oatmeal (really...not sure how they did that, but really)...and my wifes fajitas tasted like a salt block.  After our dinner (which took about 17 minutes total from the time we ordered till the time we bailed), we went next door to Wine Bistro Pierre LaFond to cleanse our palate with some real food.  Bottom line...I've eaten my share of crappy food in my 43 years on earth...this place ranked right up there with the worst.  DONT BOTHER!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Horrendous experience.
Came to this place to celebrate a friends birthday and left very disappointed with the overall experience and hospitality. Some of us had stepped out for a minute and were returning back when one of the manager yelled at us for stepping back in from a different entrance. Complete lack of sense and no respect for the customer.
Don't go here. There are better places :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Waited more than half an hour to get a drink tonight. I saw someone complain for the same thing and get kicked out and figured I should just leave too before I got angry and complained about the same thing.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Wow...the recent reviews are kinda bad huh?

It's a pretty big place with lots of outdoor seating. It was pretty packed. This is where the real party got started. After stopping in at many bars on State Street, I think we stayed here the longest. It was poppin'~! It was really, truly fun. Service was pretty fast...although I don't remember if it was that friendly. Well, I found out that it probably wasn't that friendly cuz I went back the next day around 3pm. I guess this place is like a restaurant during the day and some bar/club at night. 

So anyway, my friend lost her camera the night before so we walked in to ask if anyone turned it in and they pretty much ignored us for about 5 minutes and was kinda rude when they finally acknowledged us. Obviously, they didn't have it. I guess we were stupid to go back and ask. There aren't very many honest people in the world anymore. Who's gonna turn in a digital camera with dope @$$ pics of The Jason Mraz concert we just saw at the beach?"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Always come here for Mexican food when I come to town and I'm always impressed by food, staff and the atmosphere. Food is delicious and always on point. Happy hour always a deal buy a beer and get one for quarter:) Great location and facilities. Staff is always helpful, nice and respectful. It's a great bar/restaurant in SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"While in SB for my Bachelorette party my girls got us a table at Sandbar on Halloween. Charles was our point person and he was amazing! He did everything to make it a great night with my girls! Making sure we were taken care of with drinks all night, it was the perfect night with my girls! I recommend anyone visiting SB or anyone looking for a great night to contact Charles for a VIP night at Sandbar."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"2 stars... But being they do have a patio so there is a place to sit your ass at.
Problem being it was 4pm and the all the patio seats were reserved.
Got house margaritas for happy hour, very watered down with very little
flavor of alcohol. I would say just go order from the bar tender, don't wait for a watress."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Oh my god!!! These are the best carne asada tacos we have ever had!  They are even better than the ones i make!  If your ever in Santa Barbara on State Street stop on and eat about 10 of them!!!! So totally incredible!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great for brunch. Sat outside. Really friendly service. Food is good, but portions on the smaller side. The carnitas Benedict was amazing!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Fish tacos were ok, but a little bready. Dips for the chips are good. Good place to drink and snack."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place is fantastic! The vibe is very inviting and gets you energized! Came here for my 21st birthday, compliments of Mr. Brandon Alt who made the whole night go soo smoothly. Everything from drinks to a bandaid that I desperately needed! My crew and I felt sincerely taken care of. Definitely will be a repeat customer!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Walking up and down State street we stopped by this place for the Happy Hour, which was great.  They had two for one drinks and great appetizers.  The outdoor seating was perfect for drinks and people watching.  They have heaters all over which is nice.  The food is great I had the fish tacos which were great and it was a lot of food bigger than I expected.  My bf had a burrito and it was HUGE and delicious.  Definitely going back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great place for bachelorette parties!  Our entourage walked in and was promptly seated at a ""reserved"" table, where Austin took great care of us.  They also had a bachelorette scavenger hunt ready for us, and a very nice man came over to syringe a jello shot into the bride-to-be's mouth.  All this was on their own volition -- we were just stopping by to dance!  And the dancing was great -- although it's a small bar/restaurant, they have two dance floors, one inside and one outside.  The outside DJ was spinning more techno/house/electronic, but the inside DJ took us back to the glory days of Tupac.  The only problem with the inside dance floor was that it got super hot and stuffy -- but there's a spot in front of the DJ booth where the AC blows (i.e. my dance spot)."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"You're not coming here for the best. Realistically you don't come here for fine dining. The experience we had for a table of two midweek dinner was not great. Still would come back and eat here. 

Good atmosphere on a slow Tuesday. Problems arose when it took over 10 minutes to get a water or service. Then we placed our drink and food order together. Food took less than 10 minutes to arrive...and we ate slowly to allow for the drinks to arrive which were nonexistent. (Our neighboring table received their reordered drinks placed after ours before we got our first round.) We finished our meal and they cleared the plates and then the drinks arrived. They were clearly sitting out forgotten as the ice was melted and glasses dripping, w/warm liquid. 

Tacos and burrito meal ordered were both hot, tasted good and fresh with enough flavor to not tank this place. 

To cap off the night the bus boy dropped an entire glass of water (24 ounce ice water) on the table and my lap via the full bowl of salsa making a lovely rojo mix. 

Service: 1 Star
Food: 4 stars
Drinks: 2 stars
Atmosphere: 3/4 stars

Bottom line? Would return. Hah."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Very good burrito and a geat perfect margarita.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Cool ambience , nice service . Mostly outdoor venue with lots of fire pits and space heaters. We had the  recommended  ""La asada Salsa"" which was solid , the other recommendation  ""burrito a la playa""  was disgusting. Gross mayo inside way too salty . Had it not been Christmas and if our server were not so friendly I would have sent it back. Margaritas were ok. I think we could have selected better items."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Just had a grad school happy hour night there. Food and drinks were great and they were so accommodating with our large party. There was a slight issue with the bill  but they happily took care of that. I will definitely recommend this place to others and I look forward to going back again!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"It's basically a watering hole for the UCSB crowd.

The 2 for 1 margarita deal didn't feel too much like a deal.  They bring out both margaritas at the same time, and will only serve it on the rocks.  I think a shot of tequila was split between the two drinks.  Also, they should mind the seeds in the raspberry margarita.

My fish taco had good flavor, but the tortilla was not fresh and the rice just occupied space on the plate.

And I'm not sure whether the heaters were designed to light up the place and actually give off some warmth.  May be they should consider bringing them a little closer to some of the tables."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We came here because we were in the mood for margaritas and noise. We thought we were going to sit by the fire pit and have fun reliving our not-so- distant college days. 
Well, we got to sit by the fire pit and watch the crowds get drunk and drop chips all over the place. We were completely ignored. Over a period of 20 minutes or so, many others received multiple baskets of chips while we got nothing. Nobody came to take our order. Finally we flagged down a waiter, who snapped, ""Cant you see I'm busy?"" OK.......15 more minutes passed, and he finally showed up with attitude intact,  no apology, and without chips. He impatiently takes our order, and disappears. 15 minutes later, still no drinks and no chips. So we just got up and left, and promptly had good margaritas, chips, and guacamole at Ruby's up the road,
I do not expect waiters to fall all over the customers and act like they are our best friends. All I expect is professional conduct. I can't stand waiters who act as if they are doing us a favor . This happened last summer, and perhaps that waiter has long since been fired. But I've never gone back to find out."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I had a fun experience here. Good vibes, good drinks, and a dance floor to get groovy on. I would recommend this spot. The hostess was very friendly and they are spot on my saying hello to everyone who walks by. Good is not great but good. Enjoy!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Nice atmosphere. Wonderful customer service. The place was packed, but it didn't feel packed at all, because all of the waiters and waitresses were still very friendly and attentive. May I add that a lot of their waiters are hot wow. Good restaurant for a college student budget. Wait time was reasonable. The food was delicious. I ordered the pollo con mole blanco. The mole sauce was flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender. The beans were good with the rice. Friend ordered the chicken enchilada with soft taco combo and it was alright. The sauce for the enchilada needed to be spicier and the taco just tasted like your normal taco. The presentation of all of their dishes were nice. The raspberry iced tea was hella bomb."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Great music, nice ambiance, my only issue would be the drinks, the drinks are horribly watered down. I did not have the opportunity to try the food, but my fiancé and I did order four margaritas and both orders taste as if we ordered sour sugar on the rock! 

If you would like to know if I would drink here again the answer is NO!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Sandbar is cool for happy hour at decent prices but it's definitely better for drinking versus eating.  The service is bad but again, you don't care about service so much when you are trying to drink.  

Definitely fun for a girls night out or an as a place to start your Thursday night (occasionally).  On the other hand, if you do happen to dine there, the hostesses act like seating you is rocket science.  It happens every time.  Relax, it's ok if I have to wait, don't look so panicked and confused!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Justin returned our lost phone. Thank you so much!!! Maya is a great waitress. The staff accommodated my entire family quickly (party of 12 and a baby). Service was fantastic. Great place to eat on State St. We will definitely come back many times more.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Standard corporate restaurant/bar/nightclub. Highly funded which means cool decor, lots of promotions and events going on, and a decently run business. It also entails mediocre food and service without the owner operator feel to it. Regardless its always a fun place to get tacos and drink margaritas, just drink , or dance. It's cheap compared to most places on state but so are the ingredients. Good place to go if you aren't trying to spend a lot of money or want to get drinks in a fun environment"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"My boyfriend and I were dining here a couple months back, and we saw 2 guys with their girlfriends trying to get a table. These guys were very obviously Mexican. The hostess didn't let them in because she said their shorts were ""too baggy,"" or something stupid like that. No kidding, about 10 minutes later, a white family walks in and the man in that group was wearing shorts that were just as ""baggy"" as the other guys we wearing. But they let him in, no problem. For a ""Mexican"" restaurant, they really aren't very Mexican friendly. And being Mexican myself, I can honestly say I will never dine there again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"If you can sit outside on the patio it is so nice and great ambiance. 

They make their taco shells homemade. I recommend the corn. 

The shrimp tacos are to die for. 

They have a very large tequila selection, and if margaritas are your thing, this is the place to go!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is always our go-to for great Mexican food and an enjoyable patio while in SB. We've never had trouble being seated right away and accommodations are always available for us and our toddler. 

Most recently we enjoyed the patio as the sun was setting and sipping on a beer and , my favorite, the watermelon fresco margarita! Fresh chips and salsa were at our table as we sat down and our waitress was quick to get our orders.

We've been to Sandbar multiple times while in town and even three years later I couldn't recommend this place more!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,The last 2 stars are for Riley our server. He was awesome and ready for us to order anything. He made the experience. Otherwise the person at the entrance and the other bartenders were not very personable...did not want to make us return. Food was good. Prices cheap. Service definitely ruined the experience for us....besides Riley.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place is very young, figures, it's on State street.  

Happy hour is great!  two for one drinks, can't beat that!!!  Although my martinis are usually exempt from the happy hour deal, but the discounted appetizers and drinks are what you want to come here for.  

If you get the tacos, just know that these tacos are MASSIVE!  I got 3 tacos thinking it's the tiny little ones... I was only able to eat one of the 3 I got..."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We came here for dinner and drinks and ate in the bar. All the food was perfect and better than we expected it to be. Guacamole & salsa were fresh, quesadillas were cooked just right and the chicken was juicy and the fajitas were very flavorful! 
The server was very friendly and nice although the service was just alright. We had to ask for silverware & napkins after the food came out. Can't make fajitas without some forks or spoons. 
I would still highly recommend this place. We would like to visit again for dancing."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"... always turns into a good time... although, I have only been here to grab drinks and start dancing. With a floor and a stage there's a quite a bit of room for a bar. The DJs are usually good about mixing it up.

The bartenders have always been super nice and upbeat, even when it's chockers. I've even had a bartender completely forget to give me my bill and after asking him for the third time he put our round on his tab - excellent and very curteous - thank you Mr. I Got the Tab!!

To the man manning the front - thank you, thank you for waving our cover the Friday before Halloween. We had money for the bar only and were saddened to hear of a cover after waitin in line... your passing us along made our night - kuddos to ya!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Being that I'm Mexican and love traditional Mexican food, I rarely eat at places like this.  I normally just go for the Magaritas :)   Well, after seeing the plates of food come out to other tables I was pretty impressed with the plating of the food and how delicious it looked and smelled.  So I decided to indulge.  

The Margaritas were good.  They have a wonderful selection of Tequila (the good stuff and my fave, Tres Genereciones blanco).  The Chips were freshly made, and the salsa was remarkably good (could have used a little less salt).  

My friend and I enjoyed the food.  The fish tacos were small, but tasty.  Made your standard way (cabage, pico de gallo, cream), with a twist, homemade corn tortilla. I also had the carne asada Supreme burrito.  It was different, but good.  They filled it with a sweet corn salsa (it was really good, but unexpected).  Also, it wasn't carne asada, it was just cut up steak; very good cut up steak, so I can't complain.  Like I said, it was different, but good. 

My friend had the enchiladas and she was happy with it.  

I loved the atmosphere and the energy.  While I was there I ran into the guy who is the builder on Restaurant Impossible. Love that show, so that was a plus ;)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I always comeback to eat at the restaurant cause of the ambiance and the food tastes great! I recommend this place and it's kid friendly! You can't go wrong with that.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great service, great value at breakfast, great outdoor seating, tasty!  Macadamia nut pancakes amazing! Salsa is killer! Loved it!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"About a  5-6 weeks ago I was driving up the coast from San Diego and made a pit stop at beautiful Santa Barbara. Walking up State Street I found this great looking restaurant to stop by for a margarita while I do some business work on my laptop. It was very early on a Thursday right after they opened so there was almost nobody there, which made the wifi work great.

I had a cute little spot where I could people watch outside while enjoying my margarita, and because it wasn't busy I was able to chat with the host, Chris. I work in the pharmaceutical business in San Diego and didn't expect to talk with a restaurant host about cutting edge research done at the nearby university, I almost wanted to offer him a job on the spot for when he graduates! After enjoying the house margarita (which Chris said they make the mix in house), I wanted something a little more spicy and he recommended the diablo margarita with roasted jalapenos, and it may have been the best margarita I have ever had. I also tried the steak tacos, which may have no been the most authentic Mexican food, was still A+ food.

I'll make sure to be back whenever I make this road trip again, unfortunately I couldn't make it on my way down."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came in on a Saturday and got seated pretty quick. Food was good and so were the drinks. The atmosphere is fun and the outdoor seating is very pleasant. Service wasn't that great. Took a REALLY long time to check out, even though it didn't seem that busy"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ive been here many-times, i picked it as my birthday dinner spot twice my 21st and my 30th and i was super happy with my experience both times. Great Staff, My waiter was sweet and personable Spanish speaker huge plus, some members of my family prefer to speak in our native language so it made it easier to order. The Margaritas are delicious & big, the tinga tosdadas are so tasty! Expect LARGE PORTIONS i also had the steak with chile relleno. Every dish I've had here has been really good, & well made worth every penny i also think pricing is fair, great ambiance, and i love their look!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Art and the staff at Sandbar are amazing. I have lived here in SB for over 40 Years and this is an amazing happy hour. Do come!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sitting outside eating in a beautiful restaurant in January may sound normal to people in Santa Barbra but it is a dream for Canadians like my wife and I!

The Sandbar is a hip, fun place with great food and drinks to match. There happy hour can't be beat and the ambience is perfect here.

We started with freshly made, all the chips and salsa you can eat. My tacos were great and even the tortillas are hand made!  

Our waitress had wonderful service and the supervisor Jory was always around to see what was needed. You can tell service is important to them!!'

This place is just a little piece of heaven. Try it out and tell me if you don't agree!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Used to come here for cheap happy hour. Sandbar is a cozy place with a cozy patio but now with the new menu... The food has never been amazing pretty mediocre but the cheap happy hour prices on drinks and food made up for it. However now they made happy hour much more expensive so totally not worth going anymore. 

Ps: would be happier if they informed me about the changed menu before I ordered the regular happy hour drinks."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The bar is nice, if casual and college-y. We came in for the relaxed vibes, stayed because of Jeremy. He's a gem of a bartender - didn't know him prior to wandering in, but had an extra two drinks because of his recommendations and friendly demeanor."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The Sandbar is a great place to start on college night. Get on their guest list and they'll send you a text every week about their college night deals. One free drink between 10 and 11, and three simple drinks for $7 after that. Simple like rum and coke or vodka tonic.

If you pregame at home and take the MTD bus downtown instead of Bill's Bus you can save a lot of money as you begin your night. 

One thing I don't enjoy about Sandbar is that there isn't really much of a dance floor. I should probably go back in during spring quarter when there's a better crowd though, it's hard to enjoy an outdoor lounge in November. 

Overall I recommend it for the college crowd and their friends from out of town on Thursdays."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Had an incredible time at this place, three nights in a row! Brandon, the bartender really took care of our bachelorette party! Drinks were delicious and kept us motivated all night! Thanks Brandon!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The service and the food was exceptional! Our waiter Ryan was over the top attentive and helpful.  He kept coming back to see if we needed anything. We were here on a 
Sunday and they had a fabulous happy hour.  I had the best skinny margarita I've ever had for only $6.75 plus a buck because they added fresh strawberries.  My boyfriend ordered a Pacifico and got a second one for a quarter! The guac was delicious and the quesadilla was filled with fresh and wonderful chicken breast.  We were way too full for the soft tacos that we also ordered. Can't wait to come back to Santa Barbara, Sandbar, and Ryan!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This is my first review on Yelp. I feel like I have a responsibility to warn people to stay away from this dump. 

Where to begin? Let's start with the hair. That's right, my sister's margarita glass wasn't just rimmed with salt -- she also found a hair! The bright side: the hair in your margarita will give you something to talk about as you wait...and wait...and wait...for them to bring out your food. 

You can also fill up on their flat Coke with no fizz. 

When they finally do bring out your food (after what feels like 6 hours) you'll have to eat with one hand. Because you'll need the other hand to swat the flies infesting the outdoor patio (it's an admittedly nice patio, and what tricked us into entering this hell hole). But the flies are a distraction from the bland food (we had tostadas, fish tacos and burgers) that will later send you racing to the bathroom in a diarrhetic attack. 

Just don't expect to use the bathroom at this restaurant. I was headed for the men's room but the stench right outside the door was so strong that I did an about-face, asked our snotty waitress for the check (her attitude was what you'd expect from a waitress at a three-star Michelin restaurant) and got the hell out of there. 

The whole experience was comical. At least we got a laugh out of it. We laughed at the hair, at the flies, at the poor service, at the crappy food, at the smelly bathroom. But the next morning my upset stomach was churning and I wasn't laughing anymore. I was pissed off. And I came here to write this review. 

The Sandbar: enter at your own risk! You've been warned."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If I could give this place less than a star, I would. From the time my friend and I arrived until the second we left, our experience was ridiculously awful. The person whom initially seated was seemed annoyed and dismissive. We glanced at the menu and asked each other if we wanted to still eat here, and we settled. My friend ordered the slow braised beef sandwich, and I ordered the Mahi sandwich. We took a bite of our sandwiches and were both not pleased. Her sandwich was very messy, and we couldn't for the life of us get our server's attention to get any napkins or a refill of water. Her beef sandwich had absolutely no flavor but the salt that was dumped onto the beef. My mahi sandwich was very similar, no flavor at all. There was also almost no fish in this sandwich, just a bunch of flavorless fillings and a bun. Our server hardly ever came to check on us, and when we decided to try to salvage the super disappointing meal with dessert, the person who came and took our full plates away asked, ""So, how was everything?"" We told him ""Eh, not very good"", and all he said was ""I'm sorry"" and walked away. What was the use of asking? Was there anything you could've done to salvage our meal/experience at all? The dessert was fine, but didn't make up for anything. When our server came and gave us the bill, she didn't even bother to ask how everything was. We figured it probably wouldn't matter anyway, since they'd just apologize, dismiss you, and not try to assist you at all. My friend and I walked away very upset, unsatisfied, and once we got home, feeling rather sick, from the very little we ate. Most disappointing $20 I've spent. I don't recommend this place to anyone who enjoys to go out to eat a decent meal and have at least sub-par service."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This saddens me.. WAS my favorite place but after today ill never be back.. to start the host had no personality,  our server heather which we only saw one time.  our drink order took WAY to long, a michelada and a mimosa.. with no apology afterwards either.. we both ordered Carnitas Benedict our normal order the greens were warm.. the worst part was listening to the bartender talk to other people with an upset tone mind you its only 945 am... about how she does not receive tips and tired of being shafted we heard this across the patio are whole entire meal... in the Past  I have written amazing  reviews about this place today will be my last visit"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Stopped in for happy hour!!! Best service!!! Best margaritas !!!! Best salsa....didn't ever have to ask for more... He just kept it coming...!!! Cra how good this place is!!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We came to Santa Barbara for my cousins bachelorette party for Halloween and spoke with the promoter, Charles, about getting on the list that night. Not only did we get on the list, but we picked one of the very reasonably priced 'Bachelorette' packages they offered and felt they went above and beyond what we were promised! Not only did they treat us like the most important part of the club, they were always available, brought our drinks quickly and even helped us complete our 'Bachelorette Challenge To-Do'! The female servers and additional male server were super friendly, so fun and felt like part of the group. We plan on going back tonight and don't even really want to go anywhere else! Charles is AMAZING!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Stopped in for a quick drink and have been very disappointed by the poor service, the weak drinks and the very high prices. I do not recommend this bar; especially considering there are so many other options in town."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came back to the yelp page to upgrade my previous review for Sandbar restaurant. I want to thank general manager, site manager, waiter and all staff who took care of our family today and treat us with a great attentive service and delicious food. Thank you for considering my review from previous visit and raising restaurant service to the next level. For sure will be back again and will recommend the place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,My favorite spot on state st! I've been here dozens of times and I am always satisfied. Their burritos are the best! They have so many options. I love the presentation of their food as well. Their guac is so fresh and creamy. Their drinks always hit the spot. The decor is perfect especially for Santa Barbara. I love sitting by the fire pit when is colder outside. A must try for sb.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,This place is owned by sharkeez.  The staff is a bunch of 20 yr olds.  Skip this place and avoid sharkeez.  Corporate and bland.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I took my wife shopping in Santa Barbara and stopped by during happy hour for a beer. I'm not a cheap person but $6.75 for a 8 ounce glass of 805 beer is not considered happy hour.. The facilities are nothing to write home about so the place should be added to the list of current tourist  traps. I'm a good tipper  but I  hate getting ripped off. Fortunately there are many other great places nearby. 
NEVER AGAIN !!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,This is the first place I ate at in Santa Barbara and I keep coming back every time. It has an awesome atmosphere and a patio with a great view of State St. The host Celeste welcomed us in and managed to get us in right away even though it was a busy Saturday night. Great service and great food. Definitely recommend!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I were in Santa Barbara for our honeymoon the end of September 2014 and happen to see this place as we drove past it as we cruised up and down State St.  Looked like a fun place to eat.  The next day we were on beach cruiser bicycles and passed the restaurant again.  I suggested to my husband we eat there for dinner but ended up there later that afternoon for lunch.

I was immediately attracted to it from outside simply because of it's vibe.  It was full the times we passed by and just looked like a cool place.  By the name you don't really know what kind of food they specialize in.  Pleasantly surprised it was Mexican food.  Wish we didn't eat at a Mexican place the night before, but hey, we like Mexican food!  The food and drinks were good!

I really liked the contemporary hacienda decor and feel to the place.  Great outdoor patio setting complete with bistro patio lights.  The bar area was cool, inviting, spacious and had several tv monitors.  Actually sat at the bar later that night and had a drink while we waited for our table at the steak restaurant right next door!

If I were a local, I'd be there a lot!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Definitely one of our favorite places to stop in sb whether just for happy hour or dinner. Never been disappointed!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"While the food was okay and our waitress was actually very good, I didn't appreciate the wait without taking anyone's names down.  That just seems like a recipe for disaster on really busy nights.  Otherwise, the prices were very reasonable and the portions were good.  We left not feeling stuffed, but with happy tummies.  It is a GREAT place to have dinner and enjoy Monday Night Fooball, which we did."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Terrible food, but good service.  We sat outside in the patio and it was nice, but the bloody mary was gross and the breakfast was old and gross.  The waitstaff was really nice, though."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I am relatively new to Santa Barbara and haven't been to many restaurants. A friend of mine came into town and we decided to have dinner out. Well, I'm so sad for my first experience taking her out we ended up at this place. We arrived and the hostess didn't acknowledge one of them asked ""how many?"" And then walked away. We were sat and were given chips and salsa and about 15 minutes later (after asking two other people for assistance) finally received service with the server never apologizing for not receiving service and stated ""they never told me you were my table"". His response was pitiful. I will never return to this establishment again. Horrible service and not worth it."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Would highly recommend this restaurant. Outdoor patio or inside seating. Great service. The bartender  Arthur was great. We had the bean and cheese and burrito which was huge could feed two people easily.. Just a fun place to relax and enjoy the view.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Tarrah is incredible. Friendly and welcomes everyone. I come to sandbar for her. She has awesome promotion for parties, easy to contact, and has great customer service. She makes Sandbar great! Thanks Tarrah!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Another one of those college town ""Mexican"" restaurants.  The only thing Mexican about this place is the handful of employees that are in fact Mexican.

We stopped by for happy hour margaritas and appetizers, but were quickly dissuaded by the bartender.  We ordered two house margaritas, which were two for the price of one.  What we received was two cups of margarita mix with ice and a $14 tab.

Things could have gone better, but they just got worse...we won't be back ever again."

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Sandbar has become our destination of choice for lunch when my group of friends visit Santa Barbara for our annual train ride.  I've enjoyed the shrimp tacos-TASTY! and the bean and cheese tostadas- very tasty and the corn tortillas are the best!  Now for the cocktails:  GET THE MANGO MARGARITA!!  It resembled a 7-11 Slurpee but for adults only.   I've been back twice since our May trip.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"HAPPY HOUR is where it's at!

Seating is semi-limited, but if you have good luck with timing, it can be a really great experience! Been there twice this month, sat at a table inside once and around the fireplace the second time. Liked outside atmosphere the best, but a hightop table inside was also fine for just catching up with a girlfriend.

Most of the appetizers are half price, making them super inexpensive for their size (seem to be full size and reallyyy good!). Also 2 for 1 drinks :) - I love the white sangria with the big chunks of fresh fruit. Yum!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,The Sandbar is outstanding! Wonderful restaurant and bar. Great entertainment. We were on a sales retreat and we took 20 of our peers to the bar and I left my credit card. I did not realize I had left it till I got home 100 miles away. I called the restaurant and the Mananger mailed it back to me the same day. I can not give this place and it's staff enough accolades. Thank you so much.

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Let me just say that I LOVED this place. As a visitor from LA, I'm used to lots of typical Mexican food restaurants. But I stopped by Santa Barbara on my way to the bay, and I couldn't have been happier. First off, what a great setup. It's open and lively which was a nice pick me up for my trip. Secondly, the service was AMAZING! Our first server Heather greeted us in a timely manner, gave us great margarita recommendations. That Perfect Margarita was truly perfect! I love tart drinks. She has good taste! Then my server let me know she was going home, and Brandon took over, and he was just as amazing! He recommended the crispy chile relleno and enchilada, and it was so satisfying. The chile was over this really savory citrus sauce and I was impressed. Brandon came by in such a timely fashion, checked up on us, cleaned up, and made sure we were having a great time. We left happy and ready for the trip north."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Stopped by for happy hour and it was fun! Very reasonably prices margaritas and Sangrias! Both were quite good... they also have good deals on lot of domestic liquor and beers as well. We were there in December, and the weather was closer to 45F. But we still sat outside and was kept warm and toasty by the well set up patios with plenty of heaters and holiday lights!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Let me begin with the positive...great location on State Street, plenty going on and great people watching location because of the their nice outdoor seating area. The food was nothing to write home about and a bit over priced for what you get. But what really stuck with me was the terrible service that we received because our server was also the bartender and had to order at the bar. We were originally seated outside right next to a patio heater that was emitting a strong propane odor and it was not even turn on; so we asked to move and consequently moved to the bar area...as we watched 3 different parties get seated by the 'smelly' heater and all 3 parties asked to be moved.  I am just wondering at what point the server of the section and/or the hostess should realize that the complaints are valid and not seat anyone next to that 'heater'! Anyway, I will not be back considering the company the restaurant is surrounded by!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I have mixed feelings about the place so I will break down my critique on the place as follows:

Atmosphere- Nice place but the fact that the place was teeming with beautiful college kids and waitresses made me feel somewhat self conscious.

Score- 4

Staff- note to hostess and waitresses- this is not Hooters- their shorts are ultra short and I've been there 2x's- first time, the waitress had such a short skirt that if she bent over, i could see her ovaries. 
Also, I've gone with my husband and they flirt with him and act like I'm not there, so leaves me in a crappy mood.

Score- 1

Service- to the 2nd waitress's credit, she did come around a lot to see if we were doing fine- problem is that she only acknowledged my husband who was further away from her. We also asked for napkins and water and didn't get until we were almost done with our food.

Score- 3

food and drink- the food is good. I would stay away from the shredded chicken. their quesadillas were really good. Their Mexican beer selection is awesome. I found a bug in my water but the waitress changed the drink immediately.

Score- 4

so 12 total divided by 4 is a score of 3."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Have had many great times at Sandbar, jamming on Wednesday reggae night, plus full moon dance party's every first Thursday with a DJ and a drummer! Food is good and the staff has always been very nice and attentive. 

No matter if your just grabbing a margarita, hitting up happy hour, or busting moves on the dance floor, Sandbar is a fantastic spot to get groovy!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The place is pretty laid back, good drink specials and accommodating staff! 

Tiny dance floor though haha


Had fun though :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place never disappoints. Try to snag a sidewalk table to watch the parade of locals, students, tourists and kooks walk by. Inside is also very fun and lively with a Cabo-like Fiesta feel. Staff is super friendly and helpful from the hostess at the front to all of the waitstaff and bar folk throughout. 

Your basket of chips arrives and there is no way to resist them. Light, crunchy and addicting. Almost anything on the menu is good and the portions are plentiful, big enough for sharing. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. Our only gripe is that the margaritas were light on the alcohol so maybe order a shot on the side to ensure their potency."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I dont know what these people are talking about. I've been to sandbar for breakfast lunch dinner and nightlife (each one multiple times) and I think it is so amazing! The drinks are cheap and oh so good (I recommend the poinsettia if you're getting brunch) and the people that go to college night are hot hot HOT. It's so much fun and definitely a place I would recommend to anyone visiting!!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I recently moved up to santa barbara and was not familiar with downtown.  Sandbar was the first place i went on a thursday night (college night). I love the feel of the place. The music is good and everyone is having a good time (high energy!)  One of the best things I loved about this place are the drink specials. Being a college student, its a great place to drink and enjoy yourself cheaply.  Everyone that works there is really nice and helpful with accommodating big parties.  I returned another time for happy hour. BEST happy hour I have been to yet and their food is pretty good (my favorite is the fajitas). 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good meal, wants to go out and party, or come in to kick back and watch sports (there are lots of TVs everywhere)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Food was awesome had the beef taco, cheese enchiladas and chilli Reno. Service was on point as well"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Enjoyed people watching while sitting outside enjoying our margaritas. Service was good, enjoyed our food and the weather was perfect."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My wife and I decided to visit here after walking by it a bunch of times and seeing it was always pretty busy, no matter what time of the day it was.

I also wanted to catch the end of World Cup game ;)

We stopped in for a drink and it was a great experience. I had a Mojito and the house Margarita. The Margarita was pretty good but the Mojito was killer! I could have had about 10 more.

The complimentary bottomless chips and salsa were a nice touch. Their salsa was good and the chips were seasoned with seasoned salt and were addictive!

We sat outside and the seats were a little dirty, but it was shady and the ambience was cool so it was OK. Mostly I just think the tree near by was shedding.

The service was right up my street too. I'm from the UK so can get a bit annoyed by the over-attentiveness I sometimes encounter over here in the states. The waitress was friendly and helpful and came by whenever our drinks or chips were empty but other than that she left us to enjoy our time together.

I would definitely recommend this place, it seems like a good time whatever time you go!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"College bar - college prices on Thursdays. Trust me when I say this if you are planning on going downtown from IV this is where you want to go to maximize your wallets potential. If you are coming on any other day they usually have a 2-1 drink specials during happy hour and the food is pretty good as well. I mean I wouldn't call it ''authentic"" Mexican food but it comes close."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Bad, bad, bad!
I can't believe people here are actually saying there is great food! This is not Mexican food, is the worst tasteless thing I ate all year! Our party had several dishes and I sampled them all, so was not only mine, all bad. A ridiculous happy hour offer, a tone employes all clueless hipsters wearing CIA style headphones, is a joke.
The chips they brought with salsa were un-eatable salty, water took forever to came to our table, and so one. Drinks were ok.
The is absolutely no reason for ever going back there, and we won't.
Too bad, the place has a good location & nice outdoor patio."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"First time going in awhile. The vibe is still really great. Love Reggae wedensdays! and first time having food there, delicious!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sat outside on a Tuesday around 1:30 and got to watch the local farmers market set up.

Hostess and wait staff were pleasant and attentive.

I had the chicken soft taco and beef enchilada with spanish rice and queso. Really enjoyed the enchilada and taco although I definitely found the enchilada to have better presentation and overall taste. That said, I'm also just not that fond of mixing cold and hot ingredients, but that's just me.

Overall really good experience."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Service  very  slow..asked for a glass of water after the 3rd time asking finally got it ..food not as good as previous visits..Carnitas very dry no flavor
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Super slow service, are they understaffed?? Had to ask for refill on ice teas, and didn't bring more chips when someone joined our table."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Food poisoning!!! Had happy hour chips, quac, salsa and a beer. We instantly recognized that the salsa tasted weird. I said hmm... I can't pinpoint what it is - maybe it's seasoning/style. Hubby said no way, I'm not eating that. I stopped too, we mainly wanted the quac anyways. Well as soon as we get back to the hotel all horrendous and unpleasant things related to food poisoning happened to me!!! Hubby has a stomach made of steal, I guess, because we ate all the same things!! I might have had a few more bites of salsa than he did. Definitely gross!!! They used tons of gross seasonings to hide the fact that they are either using old and leftover salsa or they are using old rotten unwashed tomatoes. Maybe it's been sitting out, who knows!!!
Should have told the waiter that the salsa tasted funny at the restaurant..now I've learned my lesson the most unpleasant and hard way!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The setting is super nice, half outdoors, half indoors.  The drinks are good, and the staff was friendly. Food was just so/so though. I had shrimp tacos, and the spice overwhelmed anything. Perhaps try for a drink and eat elsewhere."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great location, ambience, service, and drink specials, but confusing happy hour food specials.  We sat near the host stand, overhearing multiple times how happy hour food specials were only valid in the bar area. The rest of the seating is high tops or around various fire pits so it's not a traditional restaurant to say the least. We had no plans of eating so weren't terribly inconvenienced by the fact that our seating didn't come with the discounted food list, but the initial disclaimer given to all of our other fellow patrons seemed to be upsetting. Keep it simple, Sandbar. Happy hour pricing should be consistent in the entire establishment."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"ick.
and not a single vegetarian dish on the menu
seriously."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This is definitely my favorite place in Santa Barbara!! The food and drinks were both amazing. Alma was my server. She was amazing, knew the menu and could recommend a drink based on what I usually liked. I started off with the perfect margarita and let me tell you it was perfect!! I also tried the ceviche omg! This tasted amazing and I loved that there was a lot of fish! For my main meal I did the pollo adobo tacos yummy! The atmosphere was great. Everyone was so nice and friendly. I couldn't of asked for a better more enjoyable place to go to. It will for sure be go to place!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The food here is awesome. I always like the service as well, quick, friendly and reasonably priced. I've been here many time and this will continue to be my favorite Mexican cuisine on state street. 

Highly recommended the enchiladas suizas or one of the taco combination plates."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Bad, Bad, Bad....3 times had to ask for water, waited 40 minutes for food and it was not the what we asked for- waitress blamed the kitchen - whatever...do not waste your time ...I am sure if you want to get drunk the two for ones are a deal."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I've never been to a restaurant that I had to send back the water!!!
I don't know how toilet water taste but, I'm assuming it tasted what I received last night! 
Also, the margaritas were watered down! The only thing decent was the chips and salsa."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came here yesterday for lunch and can't wait to go back!  There aren't too many places you get it all...great atmosphere, great food, and great service!
Atmosphere: most of the seating is outside in a patio that looks out to State Street and is so nice on a summer day, trees, cool candle holders and lights hanging from strings. Very cool setting.
Service: I wish I remembered his name but he was so attentive and friendly. We never had to look for him, he was on top of it (without being pushy)
Food: Chips were fresh and very good (had seasoning salt which I liked), salsa was also really good.  I had the chicken sandwich and my mom had the braised beef sandwich....both were amazing! 
Wish we were able to go back later last night because they had a live reggae band play. I will definitely be making a trip from L.A. to come back here!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Definitely one of those pretentious spots that I try my best to avoid.

Came here last night with a group of seven friends, including myself. Had to get up from the first two tables that we sat at because they were turning the place into a dance floor(lame). Waited about ten minutes and then got seated at seven stools at the bar(how exciting)! Took about ten minutes for the bartender to get our beers ordered. Took about another ten to actually receive said beer. Ordered a cheese quesidilla so atleast I can have a little something in my stomach before a long night of drinking. Quesadilla was somewhat small, but not bad for this place. We all quickly ate and then jetted out of this place.

I think that if you work there and are off the clock hanging out or are friends of the people that work there then you receive better service."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"SANDBAR has AWESOME reggae wed nights=) takes the stress out of my night shift when I can come relax after with a couple Stellas and some good music and people.. Also, the wait staff is AWESOMELY attentive and pleasant=) ANDY LAWSON rocks the bathroom lines, just sayin.
Andrew, Sasha (sorry if I spelled that wrong?), the doorman whom I ask the name of EVERY time I'm there, and all the bartenders, servers, bussers, etc., you're all awesome and do your jobs well! Thanks for taking care of us while we're there=) 
P.S.Jaymeson says you're all awesome too
definitely will be returning .. probs tonight"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Reason for visit: Bachlorette weekend!

Food: Mexican, it's pretty good! Prices are average, affordable, not expensive, but not cheap. 
Drinks: Margaritas, were delicious! They have skinny margaritas too for those who want to enjoy a delicious drink but not have so much sugar. 

Staff: We had Rich as our waiter (one night) and our bartender (the next night.) 
He was great! Very informative and accommodating with our group of 7. I could write a whole separate review on how awesome our experience with Rich was. He just provided excellent customer service, hence why we back the next night! Brandon was also an amazing bar tender!
I highly recommend going to see Brandon or Rich! ( I'm sure everyone else there is great too, We just mostly interacted with Brandon and Rich).

Friday we just went here for just dinner but Saturday we were there for the night life. They had a DJ and it was pretty packed. It was fun. Not crazy packed like a club where you can't move and there were tables away from the dance floor for those who wanted to take a little break from dancing and people watch. People Watching at a bar/club...SO MUCH FUN!! 
haha saw some thing that I wish I could of put on my snap chat story. 

Good memories here!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great prices at happy hour!  2 for 1 beers.  Free chips and salsa...The best salsa on State Street!  Staff is very nice w/ no attitude!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We chose this spot out of sheer activity and ambiance.  Great outdoor seating and music. Lively and fun place.  
Food was ""ok""-nothing to brag about and not worthy of more than 3 stars.
Shift change and we got the losing end of attentive service, but all in all a fun place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I saw reviews online and wanted to stop in for drinks and see for myself since we were already on State Street for happy hour. This review is for the bar only. Upon entering, you will pass the outdoor seating area complete with TVs and tropical decoration. The bar is open as well, which I really liked since SB weather is damn near perfect. I honestly don't remember what drinks I ordered but none of them were memorable.  The bartenders were cool and told us to come back later. Apparently, all the college kids go there to drink, which was pretty apparent since they have a slideshow of all the events they have there. Maybe next time we'll see what the party scene is like."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The food was garbage for the price. I tried the enchiladas suizas. The chicken was mostly dark meat, tasted like it was out of a can, and the sauce was bland. (I miss Los Gallos as they had by far the best enchiladas suizas dish in town.) This was a piss poor attempt and they should not offer this slop on the menu any more.  The Fajitas were just a pile of onions and only served with two tortillas. The chips were cold, stale and oily. I guess they hope their drink specials will get you buzzed enough that you don't notice the cat food grade meat they try to pass as suitable for human consumption."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Horrible food and service. Only thing they have going here is location and outside patio.  And that's what pissed me off.  You had to order food to sit outside.  They should realize that alcohol is a bigger profit margin than their lousy food. This place is overpriced too. Do not eat here!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"In short, it was okay.  The food was fine, if different.  I mean, the chile in the chile relleno was still crunchy, which is different for me.  Not bad, but not the norm.  The carnitas taco was good, but the rice and beans were meh, as in not paricularly flavorful.  And I was hungry after a long drive from San Diego!

I might eat here again for the tacos, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to get here.  YMMV."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The menu looked good, burrito was definitely false advertisement and looked nothing like the menu picture. Size was way smaller than expected and the ingredients inside looked nothing like the picture or description. Our waiter was super slow , he asked for our drinks then vanished for 20 minutes. We told him we were ready to order and then he continued to ask us if we needed more time lol. After we placed our order I got my food and he didn't listen to me when I asked him to not put any sauce. Wouldn't recommend coming here unless it's empty because you probably will be forgotten. Wanted Taco Bell before I decided to come here, should've stuck with that idea."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Good draft beer and great TVs for watching games.  The staff is good and food what you would expect in a place like this.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Great drinks. Average food. Endless chips and salsa. I was expecting the food to taste better for the price. I would come back again to try their happy hour specials. The people watching and ambiance is great.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We stayed in Santa Barbara for one night on our way home from Big Sur. The Sandbar is one of my favorite places to hang in SB. It never fails to deliver with great drinks, awesome bottomless chips n' salsa and a cool Cabo vibe.

The people watching on State St. is an awesome bonus and every time I've been there the staff was really nice and helpful.

This last time on 8/3, we ran into Artie the Manager. What a great dude! He made sure our chip basket was always full and our drinks never empty all the while spinning some cool stories but making sure the staff was focused and attentive. If I owned a restaurant, he'd be the first guy I hired."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"A great spot on State Street with outdoor seating available, and a comfy fire pit area that's available on a first-come, first-serve basis. The complimentary chips and salsas were a great addition.

I can't comment on the authenticity of the food since I ordered a quesadilla and had the shrimp tacos, but there were many menu choices that were a bit more authentic than your average ""cantina"". Even though it may not be the most authentic, the ingredients were fresh, which, in my opinion, is very important when you're ordering seafood. 

Highight were definitely the drinks. Their watermelon mojito was really good, as well as their jalapeño margarita. Although I unfortunately missed happy hour, I bet this would be a great place to kick back and enjoy happy hour. Very centralized location on State Street, so definitely a great location to walk off your meal after dinner!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I really wanted to like the sandbar but both my experiences here were mediocre. Sandbar is a very Santa Barbara, beach-esq vibe which definitely draws in tourists and many locals! It's wonderfully decorated and their atmosphere is great. Their food is a mexican-american variety and pretty tasty. One of my favorite dishes here is their ceviche, but it's nothing spectacular. I would've given this place 3 stars but the service was just terrible. It was a Thursday afternoon and the place was not that busy with about half the restaurant empty. Our server was a very laid back, chill kind of dude but also resulted in very slow and mediocre service. It took us 30 mins to receive our food and when we asked for extra salsa it never happened despite asking for it twice. When we finally wanted to leave, it took us 10 mins to flag down our waiter, and another 15 mins to get the check back. 

If it is your first time coming to this restaurant I would suggest stopping by because it is a fun place, but I don't think I'll be returning.

- J"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"While traveling in CA, and after a 7 mile hike on Channel Island, we had dinner here. Fun outdoor atmosphere with heaters for a chilly but beautiful Sat evening. Delicious seasoned chips with salsa brought almost immediately to our booth. Burritos and shrimp quesadillas were some of the best we've ever enjoyed."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Delicious food, vibrant atmosphere and great service!  Sandbar is a must do!  Nachos with beef was amazing!  Guacamole was creamy and flavorful!  Visiting from Charlotte, NC and couldn't have stumbled upon a better place for lunch!  Thanks to Yelp!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"A high pressure carnival-side-show designed to take all your money.  The hostess aggressively lures anyone on the sidewalk into the restaurant.  The staff aggressively up-sells you until you are broke.  Expect a frown if you do not order alcohol. 

I ordered sparkling water from the fountain and received a Pierre for $4.50, a classic up-sell. 

The atmosphere is slightly less obnoxious than Baja Sharkeez, a similar place across the street frequented by ADHD, alcoholic, sports fans and scantily clad students. 

Food was not memorable but not bad.  Overpriced."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,This place sucks! If want to sit outside you have to order food not just drinks. If you only have two people well get ready for a bad table.  Most of the outside seating was closed in the middle of the day. I guess the customer is not important they are more worried about making money than having people come back. Severs are nice but that's the only good thing about this place.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Good cheap drinks. We had a moron for a server though. Horrible service, and then forced to pay 18% gratuity. There were only 4 in our party, so I'm not sure why they felt they could do that. Got the hell out of there and went somewhere better for dinner."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We enjoyed the Classic Bloody Mary and Horchata Pina Colada. The Pork Carnitas tacos were pretty good. They were surprisingly not dry and tough, which I have encountered frequently at eateries. I will order them again. There are a lot of seating options, which is great if you want to sit away from the loud music to chat, or hang out inside near the bar speakers. Our Server Lucia was helpful and took the time to point out some menu items my wife and I can try the next time we patron the Sandbar. 

The five stars are for the service(thanks Lucia), food, and atmosphere in the category of a bar&food kind of place. It is not fine dining, but it is not a dive bar either."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Took forever to get a beer and when the server finally came to give it to us she slammed it on the table like she was pissed we were here
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Had our highschool reunion in Santa Barbara in July and set-up a happy hour meet n greet here. We were in the back corner. Someone stole a purse and took all the cash and phone. We told the manager about it and he said the cameras DONT pick up THAT booth. Hmmmm?, can someone say, INSIDE JOB???  Other than that, the drinks were good, price was right, but they dont allow you to order from the bar if you have a waitress that is slow so you end up waiting forever to get a drink. And most employees there had a bad attitude!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Really like this place. Makes me feel like I'm not in Santa Barbara... Like I'm on a island vacation. Burritos are good and well priced. Yesterday I had the quesadilla work chicken. It's big! I have also had the tacos and they are excellent. The night life is the haps. Make sure to have the drink that cost $19.99
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Food is good. Lillie /Lillian is HORRIBLE. She must have been hiding somewhere until I coincidentally asked the manager if our waitress could be sent to take our order. Very slow service. She was nowhere to be found throughout all of our service. Rating is based on service received. Manager Darren was nice.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The food only deserves 2 to 3 stars. It's very mediocre.  The extra star is for the whole point of the bar... Perfect for getting white girl wasted.  Slightly pricy, service is lackluster, but it a bar more than anything.  Get some fireball shots, marghertias and a Jameson ginger and dance to some 90s/early 2000s music with a bunch of ucsb students and random moms that wanna get drunk.  We had fun, but definitely not worth 5 stars!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came here for the first time last night and had a blast!  I strongly disagree with any comment that is less than positive. Eat out a fair amount and am rather picky about the experience.

Called to make reservations for a party of 6-8 and ended up speaking with Arthur the Manager. Showed up late and with 5 people and they took great care of us, weren't angry that we were late or had less people....they held a great table for us in the back. This was especially meaningful since the restaurant was PACKED and they could have given our table away when we were late.  Thanks Sandbar!

Jacob was a terrific waiter. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad.  Chicken super moist, tomatoes very fresh, and portion so large I took half home. Would absolutely both recommend and come back again when next in town."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"A group of 9 of us went to Sandbar on a Saturday evening to celebrate a birthday. The person taking the reservation was friendly and helpful. We couldn't get a table on the patio, but the table we were seated was open to the outside so we did not feel closed in. Our server was outstanding. He was very attentive and interacted well with everyone in the group. I had the La Asada con Salsa and it was outstanding. The meat was tender and the marinade was very flavorful. My wife said her tacos were the best she had in a long time as the ground meat tasted like good steak. Everyone had something different and said their food was excellent. All our food was served at the same time (not easy with a large group) and at a proper temperature. They brought up some flan to celebrate the birthday and it was the best flan I have eaten. Sandbar is a busy place (especially on a weekend evening) but they have a large staff that really hustle and appear to work well as a team. We will be back when we come back to Santa Barbara."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Hit sandbar to celebrate a friend's newly single status. Perfect margaritas and tequila shots got us in a good place. Only bummer was we went out after the kitchen closed. Had to get our drunk food elsewhere. But good drinks and good music topped off with hot ladies galore!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Is it possible to give a zero stars rating? 

My husband & I have visited the Sandbar every time we have gone to Santa Barbara for the last few years. The food is not anything amazing, the service was less than amazing but the atmosphere was always fun so we always returned. This past trip, when my husband approached the hostess stand, the hostess informed him she could not seat the party because of the tattoo visible on his neck. This is bizarre for a number of reasons - 1. We've been there at least 5 times before with never so much as an incident. 2. Nowhere on the Sandbar website or Facebook page can I find anything on this (&I'm quoting the manager here) ""Corporate Policy"". 3. Other patrons had visible tattoos on arms, legs, backs, etc. Hmmm THAT""S ODD. This, to me, is blatant discrimination. Perhaps they will find something about you they don't deem ""acceptable"" - maybe you dye your hair, or wear contacts, or have a religious affiliation they just can't make any room for. Whatever it is- whether or not you have tattoos (which I don't!), I would NEVER EVER RECOMMEND GIVING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY TO AN ESTABLISHMENT THAT SO BLATANTLY DISCRIMINATES AGAINST FORMER, LOYAL PATRONS. It's despicable. & there are many, MANY other great bars with better food & better service on State Street & in the Santa Barbara area."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The best thing about this place is the comfy couches. Lazy service, even though it was so slow. Chicken was dry, drinks were sub par. Go to the funk zone instead."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place caught our eye walking down State St. We decided to stop in because we were starving and love Mexican food. We found a spot in the bar because we wanted to watch the Angels game but they didn't have the channel. Oh well. 

The bartender took our drink order but we had to go up to the bar to order. Now every restaurant with a bar section I've ever been to they have servers or if not the bartender comes to your table and takes your order. This place didn't. If you are gonna have tables in your bar section you need to serve them. We had to get up numerous times. First time to order drinks. Second time to pick up our menus. Third time to order. Fourth time to pick up our silverware....WTF!!!! I even had to get up to take her our empty plates that sat in front of us for 20 minutes. Very disappointed in the service. 

The food was OK. We ordered chicken fajitas. There were about 6 pieces of chicken and about a whole onion and a few peppers and 2 tomato slices. It was also really greasy. The guac was stringy and not good. The beer was not cold and expensive for a domestic pitcher. Good thing we were starving or we would have walked out. 

Its sad because this place is really cute inside and out. They need to work on there service for sure."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Enjoyed good Mexican food, friendly wait staff, and cozy, street-side seating between two heaters. The enchiladas mariscos pair nicely with Modelo Negro on tap. My wife had the pollo adobo tacos. Also delicious. We'll be back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Good place to meet college girls and eat/ drink good Mexican food and margaritas. Most seating is outdoors along the sidewalk or the patio areas.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Where to begin? Not only is the sandbar is a great spot to have some drinks and delicious food (try the ceviche), but the bartenders are the most friendly in town!  Request Jason S.--he is the absolute greatest--and knows how to have a great time. He makes this place worthwhile"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Had a great dinner with excellent service!  Ryan was an excellent waiter and the food was delicious!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Very good Mexican food! I sampled tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, and enjoyed them all. The blended margaritas are very good and plenty of it! Cozy restaurant. Service was good and our waitress was helpful with ordering. I will be back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Best chili rellenos ever!. Crispy fried. Not baked and Soggy. Food was very good and authentic . Margaritas were just average. Kind of expensive for drinks. Awesome atmosphere inside and outside seating.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We come to SB twice per year and we visit The Sandbar at least twice each stay. We LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The servers are friendly, the drinks are amazing, the appetizers are awesome and the food is fantastic!

Imagine our heartbreak when we arrived and found it temporarily closed.... AAAAGH! PLEASE open again soon Sandbar. We already miss you.

UPDATE:
The Sandbar is open again and just as fantastic as before!  Keep up the fantastic work, Sandbar!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Walked up at 2:00 in the afternoon on a wednesday. Asked to sit on the patio. Our request was denied because we were not going to order lunch... Just drinks and an appeitizer. Should have bailed hard, but sucked it up and sat inside at the bar. Well, that may have been ok if it wasnt for the drunk guy yelling obscenitites at other patrons, wait staff and bartenders. 

And to top it off, the drinks were over priced - watery and small. Chips and salsa.... Meh.  Besides all this, it was great.  

Will not be returning any time soon or ever."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sehr coole Location...gute Stimmung...lecker mexikanisches Essen...nettes Personal. :-) 
War sehr voll an dem Abend, das heißt ja schon was. Da es keine Tür zum Lokal gibt und der Eingang offen gestalten ist, war es trotz Heizstrahler etwas kalt."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The staff I dealt with both times I visited were condescending, rude, and made me feel entirely uncomfortable. Additionally, the place is poorly organized so that it always feels crowded. There are such better places to visit on State Street, why even bother with Sandbar?"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The Sandbar (SandB) is an old Santa Barbara (SB) throwback. Well, it's the only mega-fun, co-ed throwback on the State Street strip that is an enduring fixture. There are Madison's, O'Malley's (presently closed for violations), Sharkeez, & Olde King's Road, but let's just presume you're not looking for the ""fogies escaping their wives"" crowd. O_O

Yeah, so if you don't want to do the all-boy, sports bar crowd, you've got Sandbar and Sandbar as your options. If you want a lively & youthful crowd w/ music in the bg, you're back @ Sandbar. Period.
 
I resisted all of the Sandbar's lures for, like, ever. I have been coming to SB to hang since 2005, but I never stepped foot into SandB until fall of 2010. Why? I'm a natural resister of all places ""must go,"" & the crowd outside always seemed to say ""it's the place to be"". (Yes, I *do* go to ""place[s] to be"", but I just cannot be seen at ""everybody goes there"" spots unless I'm really in the mood to be one of ""everybody,"" which is rare--try almost NEver.)

My desire to knock back a few [Str]ong Islands after a long drive from SanFran one night dropped me off into the SandB's lap one Sunday eve in November. Flyers were strewn about, advertising a Reggae/Dancehall Tuesday night. Umm... Hel-looo! I'm soooo there!

Of course, I've never actually gotten the dander enough to drive up the coast on a Tuesday to peep the Reggae night, but I have returned for weekends @ SandB, & returned have I! I came one night, & ""all's"" I remember was partying so darned hard that I had to return the next day to pick up my change from the $100 I had given the bartender as a ""tab"" opener. 

What rocked? The bartenders were super honest about it, & they even had my name written on an envelope w/ my $60 change inside. Needless to say, I was overly impressed w/ the character exhibited by the SandB's staff. I was impressed so much so that I have returned for the UCF's Michael Bisping vs. Jorge Rivera fight today to soak up the atmos after a solitary day en las montañas. And SandB's everything I remember: fun, peopled, stiff-drink-serving. ;)

 Hey, I even got my new favorite saying here from the UFC fight, as delivered by Rivera: ""I want my name to be synonymous with kicking ass."" Is he a native New Yorker, too? :P Meet me @ SandB? Pic for pic. Lolz."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"10 years ago when I was 20, I walked in with another female companion with a group of 6 or 8  guys (I don't remember) .  It was a Bachelor Party and they prettty much dragged us innocent girls in.  I'm pretty sure we weren't served although I don't remember (this is becoming the theme of this evening)...

Next thing I know we made it to her apartment and I had thrown up as I opened the door of her 325 ti... who drives a 325 ti... baby hatchback BMW?!?  (No that is not nice Shiho!)  It was a very cute car and a lovely birthday present she got when she was 16.

I rarely threw up back then so something must have gone done during the night.  I do not recall all the details but thank Sandbar for getting an eventful (unfortunately not very memorable for me) evening started."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Das beste Club Sandwich was ich jemals gegessen habe ! Super lecker! Die Bedienung super freundlich. Das Lokal an sich sehr gemütlich und lädt zum Genießen ein.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The waiters and service here is the absolute WORST you can imagine. We came in here to celebrate my wife's birthday and had a utterly
Disappointing experience.
The waiter was rude and completely bored. Since we were a party of 14 I guess they knew we had to pay a 18% gratuity.. but they didn't put an ounce of effort to earn in. At one point the manager yelled at my friend for absolutely minuscule issue which was too much for us and we ended up leaving. 

I hate this restaurant because they lack basic civility.
I would give them a zero rating for hospitality.. freaking idiots!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I visited this restaurant to watch a 49ers game while I was traveling in the area. My friends and I ordered the fish tacos. They were average at best. The service was slow and took a while to get someone to take your order or get the bill. There were plenty of tv screens with all the NFL games going at the same time, which is the biggest plus. I would come here again solely for that reason."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Came here on a Friday night in the summer because 1. some guy came up to us and said we could get a free round of shots and 2. it was the few places with a crowd in it.
Yay for free shots, and not crappy well ones at that but my favorite! Thank you bartender!!
After our drinks we hung around for an hour or so, people seemed to be having a good time inside but we were tired of the same conversations with people of, Where you guys from, is today a birthday/bachelorette, where you guys going next? I guess SB isn't used to a group of mostly Asian girls out about on the town in the summer. So we went to the patio area for awhile before we bailed.  
The drinks were relatively cheap, a round of GG for 5 girls was only $43.  So different from what I'm used to! 
Wasn't exactly my cup of tea but I could see how when school is back in session this place is poppin'"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The BF and I took a trip to SB for the weekend and found this place while walking along State Street. We came in the evening for the dancing and drinks. Overall we really liked this place. The drinks were cheap and the bartenders were generous with the alcohol. The DJ was playing good music when we were there so of course that's a plus. There are quite a few places on State Street and this place wasn't to busy so we were happy about that. We were able to grab a table, drink, and dance the night away. Overall we enjoyed it and will def come back for drinks when we visit again!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place is AMAZING! Went for the first time tonight and loved it- awesome atmosphere, yummy food and amazing service! I would highly recommend it- our server Christina was fabulous and so kind and helpful, the whole waitstaff with nice and accommodating! Try this place! Can't wait to go back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Cool place to hang out and have some drinks in the evening.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My first time in Santa Barbara and came across this place for happy hour on a sunday!! so i had nothing to do so hey why not  got sat down quickly and waited on quickly happy hour is every day 3-7 and menu is house margarita, sangria and mexican and domestic beers and hafl off appetizers. drinks are 2 for 1 and i was surprised they brought both my beers at same time so i like"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Very expensive and real bad food. Just hated it. Won't go back here. This was a mistake. Ordered medium-rare carne- asada, got well done burnt ones. The house margarita was some cheap liqueur that gave us headaches right away. $12 hamburger again ordered medium-rare, and got well done dried out one. Count chew the beef casadilla the meat was so hard. Paid $100 and got bad food."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"My friend's words exactly walking out of Sandbar ""I don't think I've ever had worse service...""
Our server was also a bartender, which is probably why she was too busy to come over and check on us/refill our drinks at all. I understand that its hard to balance, but they weren't even packed. The two fajita plates that we ordered took 35 minutes to come out. We had to walk up to the bar to ask where they were, ask the hostesses for to go boxes, and to the bar again to ask for the check.
I give it 2 stars instead of one because the ambiance  is really nice and our server, when she did come over to hand us our checks, was really cool and talkative.
It didn't leave a very good impression. We probably won't be returning unless it's for drinks / nightlife."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I usually go for the happy hour once or twice a week. All the bartenders are fantastic, but today Ginny (despite being a Georgia Dawgs fan) went above and beyond. She was training the new bartender and was being attentive to everyone's needs. Definitely going to be coming back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great outdoor dining with an interesting horchata/piña colada drink that must be tasted!

The food is home style Mexican and was truly amazing: seafood enchiladas, chicken burrito, and soft tacos all disappeared quickly.

Best of all - truly excellent service!
(I was 5 tables away, but the hostess noticed I needed a new knife and brought me one before I could ask!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Every time I come to Santa Barbara, I'm always excited to come to Sandbar! The service is great, Tarrah is always super friendly with everyone! The drinks are great, the food is delicious and they always have fun parties and events! Definitely a must when you're in SB!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,This is a really chill place. Their margaritas are drop dead amazing. Their food portions are huge. It gets crowded at times but there's a reason for that. Great for night life and always popping during holidays.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Super slow service at the bar on a Tuesday night.   Left before I finished my beer and ordered any food.   A star for the beer being cold.   Another for being on state street.   



*Update*.  Sure thing, Aron.   Food sounded good by the descriptions.   Wish I had a chance to try it.   Will give the sandbar another shot next time I'm back in SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,I can't believe you call this a Mexican restaurant the service is poor the food does not have any spice or season you whatsoever. What are the restaurant do you go to work when the main entrée comes before the appetizer. They really need to do the homework on the Mexican food and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who's hungry or has a taste for Mexican really disappointed.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Sandbar is a great place to grab a bite to eat with friends. I wouldn't go on a date there though. It's a little loud and since it is on State ST it's very touristy. The place is big but somehow you always feel as though you are touching the table next to you. Although the food is pretty good and the drink specials are awesome.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"My friends and I came here and asked for a table at Happy Hour and they said we could only have a table if we were gonna order dinner.  It was before 6 p.m... are you serious?  We asked if we could have a few of the small tables inside and the guy asked again, ""you're all gonna order food, right?""  Later on they also complained that my friends were smoking cigarettes at an empty table... at the back!  Exact words, ""the manager doesn't like it because it dirties up the tables"".  He suggested we smoke outside... where people were sitting and eating their meals.  Wtf?

Crappy music and slow-ish service for a place that wasn't even crowded.

Good happy hour prices though.  2 for 1 drinks or mexican beers and appetizers were dirt cheap."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Food was delicious, drinks were strong and the atmosphere was fun! Made a reservation on open table and had no problem getting a table for our large group!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,My mom and her friend ate lunch here today and just raved about it. They loved everything they had and said the margaritas were all fresh and really good. They said the servers took excellent care of them and made sure they had everything they need. My mom is the most picky person on the planet and if she likes it that means something. The loved sitting outside.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I've came here for over 5 years and within the last year coming here I've had a server by the name of Alex which has been the most attentive server I've ever had since I've been here.. I never post reviews at all, but when things need to be brought up from someone above and beyond doing their job, I will definitely go out of my way to make sure it's noticed and needed to be seen. Congrats Sandbar for hiring awesome servers."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I was only here for drinks, around 10pm on a Thursday night so the place was packed. Besides the Newcastle, I had two tequila shots so I'm sure the drinks are not any more different than at a regular bar. The bartenders were cool, the crowd is fun, and it seems like a good place to hang out. Plenty of TVs in the bar area to keep you entertained in case your company gets a little boring."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Always a great experience coming to Sandbar! 
The service is impeccable, The food is spectacular :) Art the bar manager is the man! Always making sure my crew doesn't go thirsty!
Aaron the boss was able to handle a late request of 35 people! Even though they were packed when we got there; thus, they handled it to perfection!
This is why I always come back!

Thank you Aron and crew!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar! Came here for a drink with a group of friends. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they have a Horchata Colada. Think...pina colada, but horchata flavored. Pretty delicious! Good to know they have a blender for some tasty drinks.

It's also fun to know that Sandbar turns into a night club at night (but then again, so do a lot of the bars in the area). If you get in early, you can avoid any cover. But more importantly -- plenty of different themed drink nights. 

The ambiance is full of dim lighting and some large screen TVs everywhere. It was a great place to start the night, but I suspect it could be a fun place to end the night too!

If you're here before it turns into a nightclub, the bar area is open seating, so you can just walk straight in and avoid the queue. (If there is a wait for a dinner table)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Went two times recently, both on Friday nights, so this review will reflect both experiences, both of which were subpar. The first time, with friends, the ""skinny"" margaritas actually had some tequila in them and were quite good. Seafood enchiladas were awful - a few HARD cubes of tasteless fish drowning in cheese and sauce. I think Swanson frozen dinners are ten times better. No one else at our table was wowed by their food. Lot of rules and regs about where you can sit based on if you are planning to eat dinner or just drink. If you eat outside, which is 90% of the tables, they allow smokers to sit right next to you and blow smoke in your face. Luckily the food is so bland it isn't a loss there, only to your overall health and well-being.
 Second visit we sat in the bar to have the happy hour margaritas again. I guess if you smoke, you can sit by the firepit and just drink, but if you tell the hostess you just want booze, they make you sit inside at the bar-  again - all those rules and regs - not cool. This time the margaritas were all mixer, not a spec of tequila could be tasted. Didn't even get a mild buzz on an empty stomach, after two cocktails. Our quesadilla appetizer was so greasy it left a bunch of ORANGE grease all over the plate. No seasoning or flavor, just a lot of cheese and grease.
There are a hundred better places in SB than this for good mexican food, and even more places that actually put alcohol in the margaritas. To that cute blonde young man who bartends on friday night - I am not sure why you are trying so hard to save the owners money on liquor, you are only hurting the business because I sure won't be back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Dropped in on a whim during happy hour. On the plus side, the staff are really excellent, and the service is brilliant. The house chips and salsa are really yummy, and the quesadilla was great. On the minus side, the margarita was a D- at best. I've seen other reviews saying that they're great, but maybe that's not during happy hour..."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I stopped in with a group of out of town business buddies on Monday night.  Really good crowd and energy for a Monday.  Young crowd.  DJ.  Small dance floor with some dancing.  Nice outdoor patio and fire pits.  Slow but very friendly wait staff.  Good prices on drinks.  Extensive Tequilla choices.  Definitely a place I would go back to.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Only ok.

The veggie tacos and the tostada were good.

Don't get a margarita. The flavor was good but there was barely any alcohol in it.

Staff were nice and attentive."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Well, I really liked it. Sometimes it's tough to find a good place in Santa Barbara because things can be quite overpriced and often aren't very good. We sat outside and were squeezed between a couple of other tables, but we were comfortable and had enough privacy.

The chips had a very yummy seasoning and the salsa was good. The happy hour of the night was two drinks for the price of one. I had the sangria, which had just the right amount of yummy, flavorful fruit. For my meal, I had the enchiladas verde and they were quite good. I fully intend on coming back in the future."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came in for some lunch and the place was busy. Found a seat at the bar and ordered some food. Didn't take long for the food to come out, and it was really good.  Only thing better was the service, even while being busy Gini took great care of me.  I left satisfied and slightly buzzed. Good times"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,The food was really good I got the fried shrimp tacos and that sauce was to die for. I also tried the carne asada tacos but they weren't as good. The waiters were so nice and it really is a great place to eat.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Good happy hour..B1G1 drink options and 50% off appetizers...
BUT
Horrible service... Make sure you check your tab and question any issues, especially at the bar... 

My friend ordered 6 drinks(HH prices-buy1get1), $6 well drinks, which is $18... I ordered the same... 6 drinks... bartender says $21...Where did the extra $3 charge come from??? My mistake was not questioning it long enough, but hey I figured $21 for 6 drinks is good enough even though, my friend who was next to me ordered the same drinks and paid $18 from a different bartender... That was my first mistake, accepting to pay $21.... 
Next trip to the bar, different bartender... Ordered another 6 drinks, and she said $18... I pulled out $18 in cash-exact change and handed it to her, only for her to say oh its $22 ??? WTH?? How did it go from $18, and me pulling out $18, to her coming back and saying opps my mistake its $22, there's tax??!??  OMG are you kidding me?? Unbelievable!!! 

Sandbar-why do you even offer happy hour when your bartenders are shady and try to tap on extra charges so they can pocket the tip???  Ya, that's the last time I'll be there... 
 
Next day my friends decided to go there for happy hour, they ordered(pointing and referencing the happy hour menu) a crap load of food (assuming it was happy hour) and the server didn't tell them anything else otherwise... Only for them to find out, after their food was out, that happy hour wasn't valid on fight nights... It was the freaking afternoon, the fight wasn't even on?!? But the manager was nice enough to honor the happy hour prices... So my friends just paid the tab and took their business elsewhere...

Also, if you come here, make sure you don't get charge at night time, I think they pick and choose who they want to charge... My group(10ppl) walked past the door guy (bouncer, whatever he wants to be called) and he told us to come in to check it out, its free.... as we enter, the ladies with the register or table set up before we get in was trying to charge us $10 each... After 5 minutes of trying to figure it out, they just let us in because the door guys gave them the okay to do so... and also probably because we were holding the entrance up..."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Terrible margarita. However, the atmosphere was fun. If you like dancing, it's a good place to go."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I've been coming here for years and up until today I've never experienced such bad service and horrible attitude from the servers. We were a group of 4, got seated, ordered 3 beers, and some guacamole to start, after experiencing such disgusting attitude, we quickly finished up our drinks and asked for the check. Used to love this place when visiting from L. A. but after this experience, NEVER stepping foot here again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I liked the vibe that this restaurant had to we decided to have lunch here on a Sunday around 2. We walked up to the restaurant and were greeted and seated right away. We ordered our food. I ordered the braised beef nachos and my husband ordered the chile relleno and enchilada plate. All of the food was good. The service was good as well. I would go back here again.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"A good happy hour is no excuse for crappy service.
Specially when the salsa verde is 'forgotten' from the salsa verde burrito!!  There were no apologies, no compensation.  After pointing it out, the server brings me a little bowl of it on the side.  HA!  
And that was just one of the major faults... won't even go into the service time and quality. 
Just enough to say.. state street has many many other places I would much rather visit.  Another Santa Barbara hyped up place, if you ask me."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I've been to sandbar twice, once when my parents came up to visit and once with a big group for a birthday. Both times I got the seafood enchiladas because they are sooo good. The seafood is so fresh and everything is well cooked. 

It gets pretty noisy and crowded on weekends but its a huge restaurant so lots of seating. The service isn't the best but the great food makes up for it."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I'd like to repost this review because I find it to still be relevant... Aron the manager is still giving the same b.s. Responses to people who are continuing to be discriminated against... I'm sorry, isn't there something I the Constitution about this sort of blatant discrimination??? 

Is it possible to give a ZERO STARS rating? 

My husband and I have visited the Sandbar every time we have come to Santa Barbara for the last few years. The food is mediocre at best, the service was always less than amazing but we always enjoyed the atmosphere and so, always returned - it was always our first stop for a drink when we would come into town. This past trip, when my husband approached the hostess stand, the hostess informed him she could not seat the party (of 10 people no less) because of HIS visible neck tattoo - a tattoo that is a picture of me, his wife, and my name, Candace... This is bizarre for a number of reasons - 1. We have been to the Sandbar A MINIMUM of 5 times with no incident or mention of his ""problematic"" tattoo. 2. Nowhere on the Sandbar website or Facebook Page can I find any - and I'm quoting Aron, the manager VERBATIM - mention of this ""Corporate Policy"". 3. Other patrons had visible tattoos on their arms, legs, backs, etc and yet a man with his wife's name on his neck was turned away - AFTER being a loyal patron for several years! Hmmm THAT'S ODD. This, in my opinion, is a BLATANT discrimination. Perhaps when you visit, they'll find something about YOU that they deem ""unacceptable"" - maybe you dye your hair, OR you wear colored contacts, OR have a religious affiliation they don't have room for... Whatever it is - whether you have tattoos or not (I have none by the way) - I would NEVER RECOMMEND GIVING YOUR HARD EARNED $$$ TO AN ESTABLISHMENT THAT SO BLATANTLY DISCRIMINATES AND DISRESPECTS FORMER, LOYAL PATRONS . It's despicable. And there are MANY, MANY other great bars withBETTER FOOD and BETTER SERVICE on State Street and in Santa Barbara. Please don't patronize businesses who have no problem reverting back to an era of having to fight for civil rights and liberties."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Came here for my friends birthday and it took way too long for the food to come out then there was flies landing on our food and the lights went off TWICE and when we were all paying they lost my friends credit card .... Food was alright but I'd rather go to Taco Bell
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Came here for happy hour on a Sunday.  It was my first time there and probably my last.  I live in Los Angeles, so when I come back to Santa Barbara, I'll be trying something else.

Yay:
-outdoor seating: very cute with fire pits and had a nice ambiance. However for happy hour, we sat inside by the bar.  
-happy hour: I like that they have happy hour offered everyday.

Nay:
-Drink size: I got the margarita.  For some reason I expected more. Their ""double"" was like a regular size.
-Shredded Beef Nachos: Extremely salty and a bit greasy. 
-Service: it was hard to flag servers down.  I think we were waited on by 3 or 4 different people.  Every time someone passes by we'd have to raise our hand to flag them down.  Felt like it was a hassle since there were so many people working and no one specific came to ask how we were doing until after we got our check."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Always great food and environment 
MUST try frozen mango margarita and ask for Lillian she is an awesome server!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I went to sandbar to wait for a friend and ended up spending a few very enjoyable hours with Matt.

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We came here first time when visiting Santa Barbara. Location is great. Service is ok but the food... not that great. It's missing flavor and quality. We had quinoa salad and it didn't taste fresh. Also, salsa tastes okay."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"My friend and I went to Sandbar yesterday to grab drinks and check out the new remodel. The pictures looked awesome, so we wanted to see it for ourselves. We were happy to see it wasn't very busy and were seated at a table outside but near the bar. We were promptly delivered chips and salsa and ate that while waiting for our server to come take our drink order. 10 minutes after being seated, I heard a gentleman say into his ear piece/communication thing that ""table 12 has been sitting there for awhile with only chips and salsa, no drinks."" We thought we would be helped after that but no such luck. We sat there for another 30 minutes waiting to put in our order. No one ever came to our table or even looked our direction and we watched while tables who were seated after us received their drinks and food before us. Finally after waiting close to 40 minutes we finally gave up and left. As we were leaving, the host asked us if we enjoyed our drinks. We informed him that we never saw our server to order our drinks. There was no apology or anything, he simply said ""oh, I think the bar was in charge of that section, they should have helped you."" Perhaps he was new, he was very nice, but he definitely did not appear to know how to handle the situation and did not attempt to remedy it in any way. Due to the negligent and inattentive service, I will most likely not be returning to Sandbar."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,I only ordered a appetizer of taquitos for lunch and they were filling and great. Needs for flavor but everything was cooked great. The burrito supreme was not thrilling. Needed more flavor so do the beans. The rice was seasoned well but on the dry side. Chips and salsa were good the chips were dusted with a chipotle chili powder and the salsa was zingy not spicy. Lots of flies but to be expected sitting outdoors on the Main Street.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My wife and I spent 5 days in Santa Barbara for a friends wedding. We ate out nearly every meal and Sandbar was one of our favorites. The Sunday brunch special was a great deal. Around $8 for a large portion of delicious French toast and sides. It also included a very tasty mango mimosa. We also ordered the fajitas. In my opinion some of the best I've ever had! To top it all off, we had excellent service provided by our waitress Lillian! She was more than hospitable and made our experience outstanding. We will definitely be back on our next visit!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I just returned from my bachelorette party in Santa Barbara.  We weren't sure where we were going to go for our 'big night out' on Saturday, but when we were walking around on Thursday night we were pulled in by a cute girl on the sidewalk telling us she could get us in for no cover.  Once inside, we had a blast.  So we decided to make plans to come back Saturday after some convincing by Art who works there, but was off duty Thursday night.  He totally took care of us (especially making sure my mom had a good time and always a cocktail in hand).
When we showed up Saturday night, everyone knew who we were and were ready for us.  We had a table totally decorated for our event and to top it off a discounted menu for our 'girls night out.'
We had a blast!  Two dance floors, lots of fun people, helpful and attentive staff, and discounted cocktails!!  Once again, Art hooked us up with some shots and attention to make our night even better.  Also, unfortunately, I do not remember her name, but the really cute blonde hostess was such a doll and totally helped our good time!
Thanks, Sandbar (Art & cute blonde hostess) for helping to make my bachelorette party so memorable!  We will see you next time we are in SB!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good place to drink at happy hour since it's 2 for 1 and apps are 1/2 off. The combo plate is big enough for dinner and you can get drunk on $30. We went when school was out so it was pretty tame, but I'll bet some regrettable memories have been initiated here. It looks like the fancy (pricey) bars we used to hit in college."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"So we have eaten lunch here and liked it. They have a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Hostess' are inviting. Great bar, no owls aloud here. Outside seating is excellent. I like my breakfast. Eggs with bacon , tortillas. She, my other 3/4 hated hers. It was fruity pancakes. Fruit? I think not. Unless you consider canned strawberry's Fruit? If you do then you may be a member of the slow bus foundation. She has sleepy eyes as well. That had nothing to do with poor poor pancakes. But it is a Mexican place so I could lay some of the blame on us. But how hard is it really to make ap-cake. Axxess is taken here so it's BOGO babybashbeamer.
VAYA CON DIOS or if that's not your kinda of thing then VAYA CON EL DIABLO

EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Came in for a bachelor party on a Wednesday July 11th and it was a blast awesome staff especially Jenny that was there to help me set up everything and give us great service as well as the others staff bartenders where awesome good at pouring drinks and super friendly. The band was awesome great music. The groom was very impressed and had a fantastic bachelor party there was his words and so did all of the other grooms men. Thank you Jenny and the sandbar staff for being a part of our week adventure here in California (from Az) it was a great!!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We had nothing but a fabulous time here at the sandbar.  This place just seems like it is packed all the time- it was a good thing we made a reservation!

Our server, Kristen, was so cute and just so....nice that husband and I adored her immediately.  She kept the margaritas coming, and was just a great server all around.  She let us know when happy hour was ending (I.e. Shall I bring over more margaritas before it ends?) umm yes.

Onto the food: we thought it was pretty darn good! The guac tasted really fresh, and my husband inhaled his fish tacos.  My veggie fajitas were really good, but the portions are huge! The whole time we were here, we felt constantly looked after.  The place was packed, and the manager checked in with us no less than 3 times to make sure everything was cool.  We really enjoyed our time here at the sandbar!

Why not 5 stars, you ask?  Not very many vegetarian options :( other than that, a great place!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We randomly popped into the Sandbar after spending the morning shopping in Santa Barbara and we were completely blown away!  Let's start with the staff - each person with whom we had contact was happy to be there, engaging, and friendly.  What a great start to the experience.  We both ordered tacos and couldn't have been happier.  I ordered the grilled veggie tacos - they had some spice but were cooled by the queso fresco.  Hubby ordered the chicken tacos and though more spicy than the veggie ones, weren't so spicy that they couldn't be inhaled!  Both sets of tacos were elevated to the next level by the homemade tortillas.  Simply delicious and authentic."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Best restaurant in Santa Barbara hands down....amazing mixed drinks....strawberry margarita and Bloody Mary's are the best....for brunch the Carnitas Benedict Croquette are the best for Sunday brunch....for lunch and dinner i always get the taco & Chile Relleno
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love the Sandbar.  We found this place by accident.  We were walking down State st and just looked at the menu and even better Happy Hour menu and stopped in.  Now its our once a week date place!  We come almost every week for our date night!

I love the margaritas and the appetizers.  Sometimes we even make a meal of just Happy Hour specials!  Great food in the outside restaurant too!

Excellent service!  

A good stop if you are visiting Santa Barbara, or a great place to make a regular habit of you live here!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Really don't need more than this. Margaritas we're awesome! We had the watermelon fresca and the muddled cucumber and jalapeno, the latter being the favorite. The frozen fruit margaritas looked like winners. The free housemade chips and salsa were fresh and good and the fajita we split (half steak half shrimp) was just delicious! I'm usually not a green pepper fan but the peppers and onions on it were great! Fun, laid back atmosphere and great service! Perfect stop for a hot afternoon."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Happy Hour. If you're a tourist wandering State Street undecided on a place to grab some appetizers and drinks, Sandbar is great for happy hour. There appears to be a variety of places to choose from in the area of downtown Santa Barbara so if you need a compromise, you won't be disappointed. Half-off on specified appetizers and drinks. We stuck with Sangria and Margaritas and the appetizer portions are large enough to satisfy as a meal (just under $4). Started with chips & enough guacamole to put the brakes on the arteries. Seriously the best, shrimp quesadilla and chicken taquitos I've ever tasted in awhile. 

Atmosphere - noisy, with music, loud happy people (some drunk), peppered with big screen TVs all around. Fun place to have some drinks with friends and catch some sports. We had an opportunity to sit at a table that had a a leather sofa decorated with pillows on one side and chairs on the other (seats 4) - seating area was elevated on an upper level, great to view the rest of the crowd in the seating area. 

Great for children? Don't bother
Take your mom? Forget about it
Place to meet a douche? Probably guaranteed
How's this place for dinner? Read the other Yelper's reviews...
Suggestions? Make a reservation if you want to sit in a specified area with a group

Look forward to hangin' out here again on my next visit to SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The food was good but barely warm. The service was terrible. Waited a long time for a waitress to come to our table. Asked two people for salsa and didn't get it until we asked a third person who happened to  have an extra salsa on her tray.
The atmosphere is nice with heaters near  the tables."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Flies!!! Read ""not recommended reviews"". I wish I had. 

Yay I love flies drinking my water and on my food. Really bad service and food had no flavor. Could not not not get any salsa. No flavor in the food just really a waste of time and money. Margarita was weak. Beef burrito was gummy. No spices.  Beer was good. If this place did not have outdoor seating would not have gone. Is that all it takes to stay in business here?  I would also say that boyfriend had chicken tacos with ""homemade tortillas"".  He was not impressed.  I make better chile sauce with dried ancho and pasilla chilies from the local store.  Oh well."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"this place was horrible, we were served on chipped plates, really & the tacos were stone cold, we will never go back"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Coole Bar mit gutem Essen aber man kann auch einfach etwas trinken. Die Bedienung ist auch hier sehr freundlich.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Steven and I frequently walk past this restaurant. For some reason it never held a PO for us. I think that in the past that had kind of a slimy reputation as hey pick up bar with bad food. The sandbar under went a major renovation and updated everything. We were looking for someplace where we could use our access card-someplace we've never tried before and we decided to give the Sandbar a go. We are so happy we did. Steve had the Carnitas taco, chili Relleno  combination plate. I had beef steak and shrimp combination fajitas. Our food was really delicious. Very flavorful and fresh. The prices are very reasonable especially when you consider that this restaurant is located on State Street. One of the most expensive streets to own a restaurant. The atmosphere is casual, fun, but very clean. The waitstaff is prompt and attentive but not pushy. There are televisions everywhere so I can assume that during football season this place is packed. They also have a nice happy hour. If you're looking for a place in the center of everything to have a very good meal, do the sandbar a try. Overall we really enjoyed our meal and our experience at The Sandbar. We will be back"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Great place... good vibe... BUT - horrible service and weak drinks. Our server was a blonde bimbo who acted like she was doing us a favor,  and tried to ignore us. When I told her that the drinks were weak, she wanted $7 for an extra well shot... what a rip off!!  I don't know what the management is thinking, but good drinks and good service without the crappy attitude are PARAMOUNT!!! They will be receiving a call from us."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I wanted a margarita and one of my daughters wanted a hamburger, so we thought this place would fit the bill.  The food was actually good.  Besides the hamburger, we had carne asada tacos and a burrito.  The carne asada was tender and delicious.  The guacamole was a bit salty, but still tasty.  My margarita was ghastly.  Way too much cointreau in it.  I had to ask for about 20 limes to give it a balanced flavor.  Our waitress was friendly and accurate and generally the staff was friendly.  The hostess was, however, not.  I'd come again for the outside patio and close proximity to people watching on State St., but then again, State St. has lots of outside patios!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Excellent Mexican food at a reasonable price and service and drinks (especially Margaritas) were wonderful (try their guacamole & Ceviche for sure as appetizers).  Our server Tanya was very personable and prompt and we greatly enjoyed our dinner.  We were visiting Santa Barbara and the Sandbar is in a great location right in the middle of State Street.  Even on a Sat night we were able to get right in and the service was much faster than I expected considering how busy they were.  Its a very relaxed and warm atmosphere with firepits and a few TVs located around to make for an enjoyable & comfortable experience.  We will definitely be back.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I usually do not go to bars, but we decided to give this one a try! Our waitress Lillian gave her recommendations and gave us great service! She was very knowledgeable about the menu, talkative, and attentive. Had a nice small dinner with no complains."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"My boyfriend and I came to celebrate his Birthday, the girl was very nice then shehe attitude and told us there is no room to sit it horrible when it's someone's birthday and they get moved 2 times and there is plenty of room in the back. I will never come back here."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I think this place is under rated,  The food was excellent.  Everything was fresh and well presented.  The house wine was good.  If you are looking for some good fresh Mexican food in a casual environment this is the place.  The restaurant was busy but we were not rushed.  When we arrived it wasn't as busy so they offered us  two tables so we could choose where we wanted to sit.  Extra nice hostess!  This was the perfect stop before an afternoon concert at the SB Bowl."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great bartenders! Live music, 2 for 1 happy hour specials!  Check it out!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Really good Mexican food! We went for lunch and I had the taco combo, excellent (whole-made) tortillas and the house hot sauce is great. 
Worth a try!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Had a quick dinner at Sandbar before heading to the downtown farmer's market. The achiote chicken quesadilla was sooo good! The tortilla was crispy, and inside are delicious melty cheese and chicken... Mmmm! Also, the meal was very filling for me (took some left over home) despite that the price was surprisingly cheap (about $7). A very enjoyable experience here."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good food and drinks. Went to DT with a couple friends and sandbar was one of the places we hit up. Had some drinks and danced. The DJ had some good vibes going. Overall, a good spot to check out."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came here with the wifey (Nataly A.) after walking by the previous night. We made an agreement to stop by for lunch and we were not disappointed. Definitely will be coming here again.

I tried the Chile Relleno plate with an Enchila plus rice & beans. Loved it!!!  My wife got braised beef nachos and they were also delicious. 

Definitely will consider it once we go back to SB. The only we had was there salsa wasn't spicy at all but thats no biggie."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Came while my husband and I were visiting Santa Barbara and this place was amazing!! Food was great and happy hour was definitely well worth it!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"2nd time there nice place, good vibe.. food was decent quality. Only complaint was the Margarita was a bit weak, the chips were cold and salsa average at best. But overall would go again."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Very good food, huge portions.  The service was great."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,We just went to get a table outside with our pup and the hostess told us we could tie our dog up to the fence on the outside. Governor Jerry Brown passed a law in CA allowing well behaved dogs to be in outdoor restaurant areas on a leash. Hm!?
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,The food was amazing and let's not talk about the margaritas! The service was good and a nice little spot to hang out near the beach....
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I thought Sandbar had a great happy hour and the service was great as well! Will definitely come back here on our next trip to State Street.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"- Happy hour is good
- Food is bland
- Service sucks
- Ambiance is nice
- Bros everywhere- i came to SB to get away from this...

Won't be back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good food, good service. We sat out front by the street so it was nice to people watch. Tables were a little close to each other, but other than that it's all good"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Normally, Sandbar isn't a place I go to. It seems to cater to the college/party-party/ tourist crowd. However, some girlfriends and I went in there for an inpromptu Happy Hour and it turned out to be pretty fun...( Once we got past the teeny bopper, very uninformed and not so friendly hostess.  really?)
We sat at the bar, and from the moment we sat down our bartender, Bruce was so great! He told us all about the Happy Hour deals and was super friendly, professional and easy on the eyes ;-) One of my girlfriends remembered him  from bartending at Epiphany a few years back and his drinks and personality made it all fun. 
The music was good and had some fun old school sing alongs. ( thanks again, Bruce)!
There was another bartender, kinda short with a scratchy voice that seemed to be a little too cool for us. Maybe because we aren't 21 or foreign, he didn't  really give us the time of day..
The food was pretty typical generic Mexican but good and hit the spot. The prices can't be beat for happy hour. I recommend go with some fun friends and make sure that Bruce is your bartender."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We stopped here for dinner one night and it was disappointing. My husband and I love Mexican food. Sandbar wasn't too busy on a Tuesday night but the service sure felt like it was a busy weekend. The waitress took forever to take our order and it took 20 minutes before someone came over to take our drinks order. The chips and salsa came after the drinks and tasted like watered down salsa. Chips were good. My husband ordered a soda and I ordered a water. The water tasted like chemicals. We ordered the guacamole and that was pretty good. My husband ordered a steak enchilada and I ordered the chicken quinoa salad. The steak was cooked ok and the enchilada sauce was tasty. I had barely eaten my salad when I noticed that my chicken was undercooked and tasted rubbery. I told the waitress and she brought it back to the kitchen. I thought they were going to cook the chicken and bring it back out. After 20 minutes of waiting and after my husband had finished his dinner, the waitress came back to tell me that the kitchen decided to throw out my dinner and make it from scratch. A salad. From scratch. The new salad came out and the chicken was pretty charred but cooked. Salad was fresh but I felt obligated to finish it, since I had to wait so long for it. Also, do not sit near the potted trees...bugs kept flying around us."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The sandbar was a delicious restaurant! The food was phenomenal! Portion sizes were huge but were great for leftovers. 

We missed  happy hour but the happy hour looked awesome with buy one drink, get one for a quarter. 

The atmosphere had a good vibe and it is located in the heart of Santa Barbra so after dinner you are a close walk to anything!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Had the boat in SB for several weeks so we had the opportunity to try Sandbar's new Breakfast/Brunch two weekends in a row.  First one, on 4/5 sold us on the new cool deal, $7.50 for a great breakfast, Kings Hawaiian bread french toast with eggs, bacon and potatoes, also included a Bloody Mary, Screwdriver or a Grayhound!  Awesome deal, and the food was awesome as well, Lillian was our server, she was great, very friendly and helpful.  We came back again next weekend on 4/11 and got the same great deal, food was fantastic once again, got the Grayhounds this time and our server was Jessilynn, she was really cool, efficient, friendly and very helpful.  This place rocks, it's beautiful, outdoor seating with really nice tables and booths with firepits.  Go and enjoy great drinks, excellent food and service."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great Happy Hour!
Skinny Margaritas 2-for-1!!

Delicious, Super cheap, mexican food.

Loved the chicken queso burrito! Really good white meat shredded chicken.

Our server was very sweet and the outside chairs are extremely comfortable!

We were 30 minutes late to see my favorite band, Incubus, at the Santa Barbara Bowl because we were having too much fun here!!

C'est la vie!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Have a degree in quantum physics? Come to Sandbar! No, not really, but the Happy Hour is confusing and listening to the hostess explain it to new customers is becoming monotonous.  The bar is 10ft away from us,  open and yet happy hour is altered for whatever reason.  However, like the old saying goes don't go to bed angry, the atmosphere is warm and staff are friendly.  Join their mailing list for specials.  Cool place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"It was my last night in Santa Barbara, and I was looking for a place to kill some time before my plane left.  I walked all around trying to pick a place that had outdoor seating, nachos, and beer.  I discovered this place, and thought...""surely, they're going to have great nachos.""  I even asked how they made them...but I was wrong.

The service was pretty lame.  I was there on 2 for 1 drink special for happy hour, and they brought me two beers at the same time.  The nachos were so below mediocre that I didn't even finish them.  (And I LOVE nachos.)  

The reason I give this place three stars is because they had Pacifico on draft and outdoor seating...and because my total bill came to $10."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Just browsing for nice lunch places in Santa Barbara downtown, we stumbled onto this one.

Ambiance : Indoor and outdoor. Couple of TVs with live sports. Being a fan myself, It's not often you see Real Madid fans in american sports bar watching live european football. I loved it.

Food : Was good. Though much less vegetarian options. but it was tasty. Blood Orange Habanero Margarita was absolutely delicious.

Service : This is where I drop 2 stars. Being strict vegetarian, they served us wrong dish with shrimp (i guess) and my wife had to vomit.

Be careful on what you are served but otherwise lovely restaurant to hang out :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This is where the noobs go to drink during the weekend. Yeah, I dig the 3 for 1 drinks on college night (Thursday nights), but it's packed. I can't even move. What am supposed to do when I'm sandwiched between fat shitheads?

This is a good place to go to watch football on Sundays. 

The outdoor heaters are pretty clutch. I also dig the firepit. Do whatever you can to keep the sluts from putting on more clothes. Good call."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This is an awesome spot in SB!

We just loved the ambiance and decor of this really cool spot. Great for food, drinks or just to people watch. 

We sat in the patio and enjoyed our afternoon having chips & salsa, drinks and a really big lunch. I ordered the chicken burrito combo that came with two sauces, rice, beans, sour cream and guacamole. It was delicious right down to the last bite!

The servers were amazing. They took care of our group without a single problem. I recommend making reservations because it is a popular place and you don't wanna miss out."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Really nice and cute spot, good drinks and happy hour, not too pricy, and great sit-down atmosphere. I really enjoyed grabbing a bite here while on vacation."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Been here for reggae Tuesday two times and both have been bitter sweet. I must say, it's better than nothing, but srsly, SB, STEP IT UP... 

The crowd at sandbar is so whack on so many levels, which is fine, but add a whack crowd with a good live reggae band and that's just saad. I felt so bad for the band. No one else was into dancing and people were down right disrespectful. The whole experience was really awkward. 

On the positives... sandbar has really cool lighting and atmosphere!! There are tons of moroccan lanterns throughout lighting up real palm trees in their huge outdoor patio that has comfy fire pit seating. And sometimes they put the surf channel on their bazillion flat screens which is better than sports or something. 

Overall, I'd say sandbar is definitely one of the cooler bars downtown, and I definitely make a stop when I'm going out. In the future I'll rethink reggae Tuesday cause they just don't draw the crowd for it, even though its decent music and free, it's just too dissapointing."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Not much has changed for me other than the fact my dog came with me..  he gets girls in bars to last down on the ground with him as he locks their face ask over just by standing there. Imagine if life were that easy!!!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My sister and I drove to Santa Barbara a couple weeks ago, to meet some friends for a mini vacay. On the last night we walked over to Sandbar. We had actually met the guy that was hosting , earlier  that evening, while we were having a drink at another nearby bar. His name was Shotts (I'm pretty sure that's his real name ) we had THE BEST TIME!  The bar staff (Art,Brandon and Gini) were so FUN and so attentive! We loved them and they made us feel like good friends. Thanks for the invite Shotts! We will be back in a couple months. We didn't get to try the restraunt because we had dinner earlier, but next we will. Thanks for a great ending to a great vacation!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The place has a great ambiance, always crowded so expect a wait. Happy hour until 8pm, the margaritas were ok, the food on the other hand was fantastic."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"....worst food ever, high prices for a small fish fillet, bartender clueless of food menu, when we got our ""pescado del dia"" it was a fraction of what the bartender said it was.
Taste was microwave style and too much oil of the fillet ....only thing is good are the chips and salsa, that's why they offer them all day long. 

If you want food go somewhere else, stick to beer if you go here or clubbing"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Awesome shrimp tacos, and the chips and salsa are tasty! 

Extra bonus, we asked if they sold their awesome salsa, and found out that they unfortunately do not. However, our waiter was nice enough to bring by a full cup of it for us to take home!

Great service, and great food."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I had a great experience here!! i'm an out of towner (from SF) and the night life is a tad different for me but I met the bartender Kyle, Nick and Travis, who ALL were very attentive and friendly all night. They made sure I was taken care of and the prices weren't too bad either! (i'm also used to $10 drinks here in SF). next time I am in SB visiting my friends, I will definitely be back to see the friendly staff and great margaritas."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Everyone enjoyed their meals but I paid $10 for 3 small ass chicken strips!! Don't get the chicken strips lol
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came to Sandbar for dinner and drinks. Ended up staying all night. Food was pretty good. The drinks is what kept me here. Bartender Brandon kept making try new drinks all night. They got better and better every time. It's worth a try if your looking for good food, great drinks and great service on State Street. I'll be back Sandbar!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great find, excellent service... and the chips and salsa...  totally worth the drive from anywhere."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Was visiting SB last weekend. Downtown was super busy due to the Fiesta and this place looked really cool from outside. They had an outside seating area, DJ and great décor. Stood in line to get in and they wanted $10/person cover which they later just applied to the guys and let the girls get in for free (I would have not paid any cover but my friend insisted). The drinks are okay. The food is horrible. I had a chicken quesadilla and it was just filled with cheese. Guac and chips weren't good. Our bill came out to like $120 with couple cocktails for four of us and some mediocre food."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Dont understand why the average is only 3 stars! Food was delicious , margs amazing, service spot on and atmosphere warm and eclectic. Definitely recommend it."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I came here on Saturday afternoon with my mom and everything was fantastic! We decided to sit at a table in the bar area where we were waited on by the bartender, Jory. He made my mom his own special margarita and she LOVED it. The service was great, we were the only ones at the bar at the time and Jory was quick to take our order and talk to us even though he was busy with the rest of the restaurant.
Food: I ordered the combination plate with a steak taco and chicken enchilada and it was delish. The sauce on the enchilada was so good and the chicken and steak were cooked perfectly. My mom wanted something lighter so she ordered the steak tacos and loved them as well. 
Overall, great atmosphere, service, and food. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great mexican food and a fun, unique dining experience!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The only okay thing about this place is their happy hour specials, worthy of a single star only because I need an enjoyable atmosphere to enjoy my booze and bites. The handful of times I've been here it's been so obscenely overcrowded.  This is a great place to go to engage in obnoxious behavior and not hear what your friends are saying."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The food was good!  We went for happy hour and when we got there we had to leave our backpack at the front because they had an issue of people stealing things...then we were seated on the patio and when it came time to pay we were charged full price...but if we had sat literally 2 feet away in the ""bar"" then we would have gotten the happy hour prices...be cautious where you sit. :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Kory was my bartender last and that guy was the best sooo helpful ! Made sure I had a great time and was always on top of grabbing drinks very little wait time. Highly recommend going to sandbar ask for kory !!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Very nice spot on State St for people watching, with plenty of nice outdoor seating. Good ambience.

The complimentary spicy salsa was surprisingly good with the chips.  We ordered happy hour watermelon mojito (very good), so-so margaritas. The food portion was huge and very decent.

Service was attentive."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If you like Americanized Mexican Food, then you would love this place. 
This is exactly like el torito except it has a night scene. It's like Baja Sharkeez meets El Torito. 

You decide."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Seemed busy, therefore assuming it'll be a hit. Unfortunately it wasn't anything special. They actually messed up my order as well. I ordered the combo with the chile relleno, a taco, and enchilada, but they forgot the taco. The food was not as good as I hoped."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Good was fantastic. Chile relleno was the best I have ever had. Service from bartenders was better than most.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Cute typical college restaurant. Jack johnson and beer. Not the most amazing food but fish burrito was pretty good
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,It's one of the most amazing places I have ever been too! I wish it was place like this in la!! It's very cool and chill atmosphere stylish interior and amaaaazing food! I loved sangria more than margarita from happy hour menu!! Delicious! Also shrimp quesadilla is out of this world as well! Love love love want to come back as soon as I can
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ben and Mike made our experience so fun! The two of them are like a dynamic duo. We stopped in on a whim to have a margarita when we noticed the great atmosphere. We were greeted so warmly by these two guys, so we ended up staying for dinner. The drinks were great, and the food really hit the spot. An authentic California experience that was simple unforgettable. (mike or Ben: if you read this I left my # on the receipt )"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Everyone seems to hating on this place for the food, but let me say: this place is great for drinks! Sat at the bar, great atmosphere, amazingly sociable bartenders, very well made drinks. Come here for drinks, most def!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The food is great, but the service is phenomenal. Art made sure my family was taken care of, and even made recommendations and suggestions when were were stunned by the variety. He was personable, friendly, and very helpful."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I went to Sandbar a few months ago for my seester in laws bachelorette party and had an amazing time! We ended up getting a bottle and Kelsey M was our server. She was fantastic! I cant begin to express how amazing she was and how great our experience was because of her. She went out of her way to make sure that we were constantly doing ok. Her section was full but we never felt like she was ignoring us or neglecting us. She watched our table while we go up and went dancing and adventured the location. If you ever go back make sure that you ask for Kelsey!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Super fun atmosphere and good food. We sat up on the bench today and it was really comfy. We've come another night and sat around the fire pit and made friends with people from all over the world. You might have a hard time getting a drink sitting over there though. The frozen Margs are amazing! We had lunch today and were disappointed there was no kids menu. We ended up ordering an a la carte taco for the youngling, the supreme burrito with chicken (massive but nothing special) and mahi mahi tacos (yummy but literally came with 3 small slivers of fish...don't come hungry for that dish. Kind of a rip off if you ask me. Bloody Mary's were pretty good. Would be back for fun atmosphere and super delicious chips and salsa!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I am not sure why this place only has 3 stars, but it blows away anything in the area.   The best fish tacos and burritos and the wait staff is friendly and attentive."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I went here a couple weeks ago when I went downtown and had a great time! I don't review very often but this place was definitely worth one.  The music was good and the outdoor atmosphere was often.  Lots of places are almost too loud and you can have a hard time trying to converse with someone.  This place has an outdoor area that is a lot quieter where people can talk, while you can go inside if you want to dance or grab a drink at the bar where the music is pumping.  I had a great time and would love to go again!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,We visited the Sandbar on a beautiful Santa Barbara Saturday afternoon and enjoyed our time there.  The staff was accommodating in making sure we are comfortable in terms of our seating as we had a baby with us and wanted to sit at a larger table.  I checked in on yelp and was able to get an appetizer for half off.  I had their BBQ Ranch Ensalada and it was pretty good but it had too much ranch dressing.  I also had their skinny margarita which definitely hit the spot.  The vibe during the day is casual but I imagine it attracks the college crowd during the night.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,We came here today on New Years Day. Everything started off great. Food was great and our first round of Margaritas was wonderful. It was 3:05 pm and we went to order a happy hour drink (Happy hour every Sunday-Friday 3-7 pm) and we were told they weren't running happy hour today. They had the Happy hour menus on the table... advertising the deals and we were denied...so we left.  I would rather go pay full price for a drink somewhere else... it's the principle.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"COOL VIBE!!  

Two of us were driving North as we strategized to enjoy lunch in Santa Barbara with the exact destination unknown. 

As we walked State Street we quickly observed the Sandbar, it easily caught our eye with the COOL VIBE alluring us onto their patio where there was a dynamic diversity of guests enjoying their lunch and cocktails, full of laughter and good cheer. The ambiance is provocative and primal with an ecliptic Spanish-Mexican-Moroccan suaveness. 

The service was extremely friendly, there appeared to be a floor manager orchestrating the servers to assure smooth continuity. We were barely seated when a fresh basket of chips and tangy salsa arrived as part of our welcoming committee. 

For starters we had the Ceviche de Pescado with Plantain Chips; my daughter had the Pork Carnitas Tacos while I enjoyed the Pescado Estillo Baja Tacos. The jalapeño cabbage slaw was the perfect topping for my tacos, no additional salsa needed. The stone-ground corn tortillas were amazingly fresh. Everything DELICIOUS!

While we were only there for lunch, the Sandbar looks like a great NIGHT LIFE destination with fire pits, outdoor heaters, ambience lighting while the seating is arranged to be alluring and intimate. Also, a place to see and be seen!

Cheers!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great Happy Hour Sun-Fri! Buy a beer get one for 25 cents! Half off appetizers! Their regular menu is great as well. The combos on the back of the menu are huge and of quality ingredients!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Good vibes and great customer service! Our server Dustin catered to our 18 person party like it was a daily routine. Never saw a water glass empty at any point! This place has good food and great service, will definitely be putting this on my list of top restaurants in Santa Barbara! Thank you sandbar for the wonderful experience for my family and friends."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We are from out-of-town and were looking for something fun to do on a Wednesday night. One of the local tasting rooms recommended Sandbar for their reggae night. We had already eaten, so this review is only based on the cocktails and atmosphere. The band was fun and the half indoor/half outdoor ambiance was really cool. The staff was all super friendly and helped make my roommate's birthday great, especially Jamie! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I give this place 3 1/2 stars. I've been here a bunch of times for dining as well as going out at night. The time I came for dining, I thought the food was mediocre. It's not very authentic in my opinion and it's a little over priced. We ordered watermelon margaritas, which was probably a bad idea since I'm not the biggest fan of sweet stuff. The marg was ok, nothing special, extremely sweet. My roommate ordered the signature sandbar blackout beach for her 21st bday and boy, that thing was STRONG! Perfect if you want to get smashed with all that Bacardi 151.

As for going out, my friends and I always stop by here for drinks from shots! DJ flames is awesome and always plays fun music!! Packed until 2am always."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Does anyone know why they're closed (temporarily) ?  Was on my way there this evening. Great place !!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Stopped by for a few margaritas and they were terrific (Cadillac and fresh raspberry). Bar tenders were quick and did a great job. Chips and salsa were solid as well.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Kory is amazing. Best Moscow mule I've ever had! Such great service. I will be coming back and recommending this place to my friends.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ate here tonight with friends. It's a noisy place but what do you expect from a sports grill?  Service was average, but they were really busy.  They made a mistake on one order out of six, but the staff handled it beautifully.

Mixed drinks were a little weak but tasted great. Try ordering your drink with no ice and that should help. Happy Hour prices are good so try to arrange your visit around that. 

The food was phenomenal, that's all I can say.  We all ordered something different and shared tastes, and we all agreed it was great. My wife and I really enjoyed the blanco frijoles.

We'll be back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Wonderful Mexican food, fast service, wonderful customer service and bomb chips and salsa."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Love this place. Nelson is the best bartender. Fajitas are on point. Nightlife is awesome. Check out reggae night on Wed
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Mexican food is my favorite and this was the best by far.. The environment was fun good delicious and great drinks... Can't wait to come back again.. Everything we ordered was wondeful
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,This establishment has extremely BAD service.  This is my daughters birthday and they couldn't accomadate our table wishes.  I would understand if they were busy but it was  2;30 in the afternoon and the place was mostly empty.  WE DID NOT EAT THETE
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Good food, ok drinks, over priced. Worst service in Santa Barbara. Terrible.  Too many good places around to even go back again. Too bad. Perfect atmosphere and location.  Is rather pay more money and go to Pierre LaFond next door."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ate here yesterday and loved it! Our server was awesome, very knowledgable and on top of it. Skinny strawberry margarita is delicious and refreshing. Best food item we had: the steak fajitas! Would definitely recommend and will be back. Enjoyed the indoor/outdoor seating. Thanks!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love Sandbar!  Great Mexican food and the drinks are wonderful. Perfect spot with outdoor seating and heat lamps when needed. They are a little funny about pets and make them sit on the outside of the gate even though it is right next to your table. They do however provide a refreshing bowl of water for them. Be prepared the number of people walking up and down state street will want to stop, pet your furry friend and tell you how awesome they are haha."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Server took forever to get to us. No chips and salsa. Food took a long time to get out.  Then she crowded the entree, salad and app onto our table by bringing all at the same time. When she saw we were upset, she gave up on the table. Our bad for even walking into this ""restaurant"".  Food was weak to top it all off. Save your cash and try any other restaurant downtown."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Food was amazing. I really don't see to much of a difference in the new renovations but it does look cleaner. I'd  recommend this place to anyone.especialy on happy hour.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My very large family had an excellent dinner here on a Labor Day Sunday.  We had made a reservation for 22 a week ahead and even confirmed it the day of dinner.  When we got their, they didn't have our reservation. (The manager later explained that the worker who had both made the reservation and later confirmed it was not authorized to do so.)  Remarkably, they were able to seat us together (excellent job on their part).

The place has lots of different types of seating from couch-type booths, to standard tables, bar-stool height tables.  The food and drinks were varied, reasonably priced, and very good.  If they can get a 22 person group to be happy with their food and service, they would have no trouble with regular-sized groups.

I would go back were I to return to Santa Barbara."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love this place. I've had lunch and most recently, breakfast.  For the price, $5.50 is such a great deal for what you get! I ordered a breakfast burrito which came with French toast or pancakes, eggs, potatoes and bacon, PLUS a choice of Bloody Mary, screwdriver, mimosa and couple other drinks that I can't remember. Also, the chips here are so delicious, I couldn't stop eating them! When I come back into SB, I will definitely be back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,Rude teenagers working at the hostess stand.  We sat and waited and couldn't get service and left.  They seemed to think it was funny at the hostess stand and recommended we go across the street to Sharkeez.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,My hubby and I had lunch here today.  Love this out door seating and vibe the whole place had. Best MEXICAN food with 'just enough portion sizes' and all the the food was delicious. Service was good.  Their signature lime Margarita was perfect. I may have had two...!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Usually we head to casa blanca for Sunday brunch, but last week we gave sandbar a try. It's a crazy good deal with food and a drink for under $10. My mimosa was good, but my friend's bloody mary was awesome! Definitely going back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Atmosphere was nice, but the weakest margaritas we've ever had.  We had multiple appetizers and they were okay, but I do not recommend this place if you like good margaritas."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I love this place. It has always been one of my favorite ways to start off a night out. The drinks are great, although the service is often slow. The crowd is young and not quite as trashy as many other bars in sb. The atmosphere contributes to the pleasant vibes."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Good food, not the best service, but a fun place overall"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"My co-worker and I were looking for something that caught our attention for dinner, Sandbar did just that, excellent drinks, authentic and delicious mexican food, and the outdoor environment made me feel comfortable and like I was in Mexico downtown cantina, Great place,  so good I went back the next day! Lillian was our server and was most helpful with suggestions, service and local things to see, this was my favorite dinner in Santa Barbara after spending 7 days here :) Shari from Seattle"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Love this bar! Such a good happy hour and yummy food. Kory is the best bartender, he makes delicious drinks and is easy on the eyes too. You have to try his mojito, perfection."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We were just in town for the weekend for Father's Day and we did some shopping on state street and decided to stop in for happy hour. The service was ok, server forgot to put in our order of chicken strips but other than that we loved it! The patio was amazing and the horchata Pina colada was so so so yummy!! We will be back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"DO NOT eat here for good Mexican food. (Go to Carlito's just up State) Stale chips, bland taste, old beans. GROSS. Margaritas from a bottle, bartenders without a clue and DJ's with big egos and small.....playlists. I can say I kind-of hate this place.

It's a college kid hang-out and tourist draw because the atmosphere is unique with it's cabanaesque look and outdoor, beachy Cabo feel. Three cheers for the designer.

I think it needs new management......

The most recent, and last, visit to this place was for my girlfriend's birthday. We were charged a cover charge-on a Thursday, despite being obvi over 21 and eager to blow way too much $$ on their lacking drinks. We hit the dance floor anyway hoping for decent music, but no. A place that charges a group of girls to enter will likely have poor DJ's too. The bartender at the outdoor bar told me I was really good looking. (Um, bud? Did I ask how I looked and what part of professionalism does hitting on a customer fall under? GAG ME with your tackiness.)

When it was obvious the dance floor was simply standing around to have space to move, rather than out there to dance, I asked the DJ's for ""something old, you have three old bitches in here celebrating a birthday."" I asked specifically for Tupac or Warren G and was laughed at. Alright, I'm old, but at least we know WE would've been dancing. How much Pink, Katy Perry and Justin Bieber can two DJ's play? Enough to make three thirtysomethings vomit in their mouths a little and walk out. The birthday girl walked up with her ID in hand to beg for a bit of hip hop and was told, ""that's not our thing."" FAIL Sandbar, all FAIL.

Indoors was a reggeton dance fest that I was SUPER excited about. We hopped around that dance floor and over to the inside bar which is about 15 feet long and had TWO bartenders and THREE customers. I stood there for about 8 minutes and not ONE bartender even made eye contact. Other customers even commented to me about how I was being ignored. 

We ran out of that dump and across the street to the James Joyce, and I highly recommend all non-dudebro's and douchebags do the same."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Easy entrance on a busy weekend while visiting from LA.  Good ambience and crowd....bonfire included!  Amber was more than welcoming and made sure we were taken care of.

If you are in SB you definitely have to check this place out for drinks and a good time!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Been here a few times the last 7 or 8 years and it's a nice place. The food is fantastic and the staff and atmosphere is great. Came here on a date and just to hang out and it was cool either way. The guacamole is fantastic and the rest of the food is pretty good, too. Overall, I really enjoy coming here"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Each time I have been to SB I've wanted to go here so I finally got to. We sat out on the side walk which was really nice and the service was awesome. The food and drinks were reasonably priced and were good as well. If you are someone who likes to eat in a fun, comfortable and nice atmosphere this place will be just right. The wait wasn't too long for a table but while we did we could sit by the big fire pit in the restaurant and order drinks- very accommodating. It was a good experience and I would def. go back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Went to this restaurant on a whim, and it was the best stop! The guy at the front was very friendly and cute. The food was very good! Their portions are huge and the prices are super reasonable for being on state street."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great margaritas and tacos! Our server Cassie, was very friendly and efficient. Sitting outside on their patio was the best!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I came here during the afternoon and the environment is chill but fun. Got some really good carne asada tacos and a Moscow mule. My waitress lil h was the shit and very friendly.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I go here quite a bit with friends when we have time.

The chicken tacos are amazing here. I love the mixed drinks as well. 

Denisse is such a charming host, but I barely ever see her! I need more Denisse in my life! :("
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great place to catch a bite and happy hour. The food was top notch.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I have always had a good time at Sandbar! The food and drinks are delicious! Taco Tuesday for tacos and margaritas is always a great choice! The staff and service is great. Tarrah goes above an beyond - she is always so friendly and makes sure each guest has a great experience and feels taken care of. I love staying after dinner for a little dancing on the dance floor as well! Great ambiance!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Kayle! You rock! thank you for amazing service, why aren't you manager?!? why arent you running the place yet! but anywho
The food was amazing! best mexican burrito i have ever had, and thats saying A LOT! ive traveled the world and had tons of mexican food, this place takes the cake, the atmosphere is just amazing and i had a blast drinking a corona, watching the X-Games and eating great food. def am coming here again and again and again. Kudos to you for running a great place!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I come here all the time and I'd have to say my favorite thing to get on the menu is the enchiladas mariscos. I get them nearly every time i visit and I have yet to find seafood enchiladas that are better. It's also a great place to go at night. They're open every night as a night club until 2, which is great because not very many places on State offer that. All in all, Sandbar is a great place if you want great food, a fun atmosphere, and a kick ass time."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ordered bottle service here for my birthday on a Saturday night. Best service I've ever had. They decorated the table with balloons, gave me a tiara and a boa and also brought a sparkler out on the vodka bottle. They made me feel like a celebrity. Colin was extremely helpful the whole time!! Everyone was so nice. The employees at the front were so so nice as well. we had a party of 14 and they were so accommodating. Dance floor was great! DJ was awesome playing recent hits! we danced the whole time! We will all be back to visit this place!!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If this were only based on my watermelon margarita, it would be 5 stars. Since it took about 45 minutes to get it, 2 stars. Carne asada tacos, 3 stars. I have never been to a restaurant, bar, hell, any establishment with so many staff doing NOTHING. At one point I counted the number of employees that walked past our table and then loitered by the soda machine. 12. That's 12 people who could be doing something for all of the tables with no drinks, no food, just anger. 

The food was ok. Stereotypically ok, nothing mind blowing but nothing flat. The chips were unacceptably stale, we sent them back twice. The guac was solid and the carne asada tacos were good, but after waiting that hour+ to get them, I may have just been blinded by hunger."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"After searching for a place open for a late night dinner in Santa Barbara, we ran across Sandbar.  What a find!  The scene was exactly what we were looking for.  A large outdoor patio was filled with color changing lights and tall lit up palm trees.  The frozen mango margarita delicious, as was the sandwich I ordered.  There was a DJ who played an amazing playlist that had people up dancing.  I would definitely visit next time I'm in Santa Barbara!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place is surprisingly (to me) pretty good - the salsa they bring with the chips before your meal is fresh is really good, food and portions are tayst, the service is attentive and the atmosphere is pretty nice too."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,The main course was yummy! The service however SUCKED! I had to ask for a napkin 3x because the drink they gave me overflowed and spilled all over the table. The salsa was yummy but the chips were soggy. Not sure that I would come back.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great foods and drinks. Also super fast service, everything is brought to you within 15 minutes at most. 
Fun weekend place"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"At first I thought it be kind of a college hangout. Nothing wrong with that; however, I am on the older side so sometimes that can be a factor. My fiancee and I sat at the bar we were just in time for their happy hour. Our bartender was great, I can be a drink snob at times and he was more than understanding and accommodating. Their drinks are good and so where the appetizers. If your looking for a chill to have a drinks and a bite this is your place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"On our recent trip to Santa Barbara, we were walking on State Street looking for a place to have lunch. We decided to try this place and I'm glad we did. We even went back before we headed home a couple days later. The customer service was great. They kept the drinks refilled constantly which hadn't been happening at any other restaurant in SB. The food was really really good. Two of us got a bean burrito and it actually had a lot of beans... Which has also been quite rare at other Mexican places. We will definitely be coming back!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Nice bartenders. Skinny margarita was very overly sweet. Strange vibe, odd music choice. No happy hour on July 4th...basically saying ""we've got you by the balls..."" but still good."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"SANDBAR has really upped their game in the past couple years! Yummy Mexican food. Fun drinks. Great prices. Cozy ambiance and a great vibe. We had excellent service with friendly staff last night. Food came out fast and so did the drinks.
Yummmmmm. I will be back more often!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Great hangout place, I dig the outdoor/indoor setup. Its got comfy lounge areas for bigger groups, tables all around, open space for dancing... very chill. Good music.

((Guacamole Dip)) was delicious! We were just snacking but the food looked yummy.

They didnt have El Jimador, but Herradura was good even if it wasnt as chilled as I wanted it to be. 

Waitress was sweet and provided good service.

Look forward to coming back next time Im in town :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I liked to go here for drinks to kick off my nights with friends (3 for $7 if you sign up for their cell mailing list and show the msg upon entering and get a stamp) before heading out elsewhere. Dance floor is really tiny, and so is the bar, a little congested for my taste, but the atmosphere is classy and cool with the fire pits and colorful lighting.

Tip- Get the jello syringe shots! The presentation makes them well worth the couple bucks."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Sandbar was a great experience! Good food and great atmosphere. I will definitely be back
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I am sure the absolutely spectacular weather combined with an outdoor patio added a star to this place.  The food is very typical American style Mexican food or whatever you want to call it but it was tasty nonetheless. The waitress was very, very sweet and very attentive.  Probably one of the better servers I've had.  If you're looking for a fairly affordable place with a nice patio I'd give it a try.  However, I have a feeling in the evening it may be very crowded and less enjoyable."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place has the best Happy Hour in town...7 days a week! The food is great and not at all expensive as compared to other local Mexican restaurants. I personally like the fish tacos and the fajitas. It's good to see on here that more people are responding positively to Sandbar, it really is a good place!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Sandbar has happy hour from 4-8 advertised, but doesn't honor it past 7pm AND if you pay your check after 7pm they will charge you FULL PRICE for your drinks.

The waitresses will also stay away from your table at the end of the happy hour to again force you to pay for full price drinks. This has happened to me several times now.

Make sure you pay for drinks AS YOU BUY THEM!

***In response to Aron***
An accident happens once, not 5 times in a row. You guys found a shady way of pulling more money from your customers and are exploiting it. If I buy something at a specific price, it should stay that price no matter what time I pay for it, especially if we are there for dinner.

Santa Barbara is a small town and I guarantee that your ever increasing bad reputation is affecting your sales and repeat customers."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place is a blast! Came to Santa Barbara for the first time for a bachelorette party and spent our whole time at Sandbar. The hospitality of the employees was unbelievable and the DJ was on point! Every single employee went out of their way to make us feel special and taken care of. Special shout out to Shotts and Brandon behind the bar for our drinks, Arthur for more drinks and great service, the DJ for letting me play and everyone for letting us close it down!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The waiter, Aliex, was super personable, upbeat and attentive throughout the meal. He made great drink and food recommendations, all of which turned out delicious. Highly recommend the Seasonal Frozen Fruit Margarita (Strawberry). Definitely coming back here if i'm downtown wanting authentic Mexican food."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,We attempted to eat at this restaurant yesterday and were denied service because 2 girls out of the 12 people in our party have visible tattoos on their arms. I am appalled by this blatant discrimination. Don't give this restaurant your business. There are plenty of better restaurants that will treat you with respect regardless of how you look.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Overall highly recommended! We had some issues with the hosts first not being very accommodating for a group of seven with no reservation, but we decided to wait it out at the bar because the menu looked awesome.  When the host told us our table was ""ready"" after about half an hour, they actually had only entered our party in as two so we had to wait about another twenty minutes. It didn't really matter though because the bartenders were super friendly and the drinks were great and we were all in good company. After the mix up the staff was apologetic and in the end we got a great high top table outside by the space heaters. I got the veggie mercados tacos which were delicious and surprisingly really spicy which I loved. My friends got the fried fish tacos, quesadilla, carne asada and a few got different burritos. We stayed afterwards for a few more drinks but left before they turned the dining space into a dance floor, but I would highly recommend it for a fun Friday/Saturday night spot!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This hit the spot after a 3 hour drive coming into town from LA area. Staff is friendly and courtious. Happy hour was great. Get the vodka lemonade and the watermelon vodka, refreshing and it it tge spot. Outside is great to people watch."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Tried to grab a drink and a bite to eat on NYE at 8 o'clock and they tried to charge $20 just to get in the door. There were a ton of open tables. If you're going to offer a full menu, don't expect to be able to charge a cover charge because it's a holiday! 4 parties including myself walked next door where they were happy to get our business."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great Spot for Happy Hour, recently re-vived menu. With indoor and outdoor seating, friendly staff and menu which can work with even the most particular customer. 

Check in promotions, twitter and facebook as well. They have great fire pits for fun times!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is amazing. Was in Santa Barbara for a Sales Meeting and it's the only place our Sale Staff wanted to go on a very competitive State Street. The drinks were good, music was great (coming from a DJ/Music snob), service was great, Management (Art) was the best part. Great place to check out for a good time in Santa Barbara. You'll love it."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ryan was an awesome server, Sandbar had great food, excellent drinks, and a very fun happy hour!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I really look forward to coming here every time I come to Santa Barbara. Why most places in California don't have a mix of indoor/outdoor eating (see: Sacramento, where outdoor eating is an afterthought at best), I'll never understand. But I digress. Happy hour until 8pm, another rarity: brilliant. One can fill up on the chips and guac, which are excellent, but if you've got room, try the carnitas, which has a robust garlic flavor. Bartenders on staff are fun more often than not, this evening in particular. I know I should try new places, considering I only make it here once a year, but the food, drink specials and atmosphere make me wish I lived closer."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"great atmosphere, awesome bar/tequila menu. always have a great time. yum."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Love Sandbar's Happy Hour and outdoor seating, especially if you are lucky enough to end up by the fire pit. This place is sooo realxed and even on a busy night, it's still intimate and very cozy. This is certainly the place to see some wicked acrobatics behind the bar. The bartenders are fun and will put on a show for you, if given the opportunity.

On my first visit, we came in on a Sunday afternoon, there was really just us and few others. This was just a quick pit stop but we ended up staying well into the night, having drinks and great conversations with strangers. The complimentary salsa and chips came as a shock, as well as the low prices of drinks. (Happy Hour is a blessing)

I have dined here before and they produced a pretty mean burger, would recommend that, although, when I come back here to eat, I will go for the quesadillas or house nachos. I'll be back with a review on that.. :)

I really like Sandbar- A+++++"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Sandbar is the best!! Run by Art who is the BOMB!! You would be hard-pressed to find a place more fun. Good and strong drinks. Great food. And the prices are fair. The atmosphere is always festive and fun. It is absolutely an industry favorite. And it's always a party at the sandbar!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If you are under 25 I really would not suggest coming here, unless your intention is to meet older people.

On top of that the crowd itself is not very friendly and the atmosphere is like any typical bar--dark, loud, and unfriendly.  The drinks were also not trustworthy.  My 2 friends both ordered a Vodka Tonic and they did not taste equally the same--one had more alcohol while the other had a more watery taste.  I'm not sure about the other days, but the bands that they booked during our visit was an interesting reggae band.  The sound system there is actually very engaging but that's about it.  

Honestly, I would just walk past this bar.  Enough said."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Took my wife to Sandbar like I always do every other week. and the food as always a perfect 10! had the Asada Salsa plate 2 words pure perfection! SHANNON YOU ARE THE BEST!!!! my wife and I have been coming to Sandbar for many years for dinner but last night our waitress Shannon ROCKED! She has been our waitress on 4 occasions. She was very attentive, pleasant even though some customers weren't very nice she never stopped smiling. Thank you Sandbar Thank you Shannon and good luck ;)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Sandbar is a great evening location for drinking and dancing; however the food selection is a completely different experience. Came here with a fairly large group of friends to celebrate and needless to say, for a Mexican restaurant/ sports bar, the food was not authentic and is VERY (and I emphasize VERY) Americanized. In pictures, the food appears to be genuine mexican cuisine but it is not. Sadly, all those in my party were less than satisfied with their meals and majority of the food went to waste. Also, the portions were fairly small in size. 

On a positive note, the overall aesthetics of the bar are inviting/ welcoming. Great decor and good ambiance."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"A decent place for tourists. I would definitely recommend the shrimp salad which is just so fresh and delicious. A minus is that the service can be a bit slow and the bathrooms dirty at times, however it's still the best restaurant around Santa Barbara that I've been to."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Love this place! Love Madie! She was so sweet & so was the manager! We went in for a batchlorette dinner & had a blast! They made us feel awesome & were so prompt with our food and drinks even though they were super busy :) highly recommended!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"We only tried the happy hour, but half-priced apps, $6 margaritas? Can't beat it. Service was good, food was standard bar food with a Mexican flare, but if you can get to the happy hour, do it!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Atmosphere: Top notch!
Drinks: Ample and well mixed
Service: Average

The best part of this experience is the atmosphere! Located in a great section of Santa Barbara, right by the beach, it feels like an Oasis when you're seated in the patio area. Palm trees, the decor and the smell of the food and the sounds of people enjoying themselves resonates throughout. This quickly became a ""must visit"" when we go to Santa Barbara.

Great time!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We've been to the sandbar twice and each time was different. The first time we had it we had drinks only. It took forever to get our drinks and it was almost empty. 
The second time we went was for brunch and I'd have to say that the food was great and mimosas as well. Our server was awesome and gave us other places to check out."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I would come back any time I am I'm town!  Great staff, great outdoor space, fantastic food"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,My husband and I stopped by for a couple drinks and had a great time. The drinks were good and the bartender definitely did not cheat us on the alcohol in our mojitos. The hostess was very nice and welcoming. Overall I had a great experience and would recommend this place for lunch or drinks.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is by far one of my favorite places to go of all time in Santa Barbara. It is right downtown on State Street and has parking literally right out the back door. Whether its for a club night out on the town with my girls or an authentic mexican date with my boyfriend, Sandbar is by far my favorite places to eat & to drink. They even have Happy Hour every day! 2 for the price of one on there margaritas, beer, sangria, and wine and half off appetizers!!!! Not to mention an amazing collection of specialty cocktails you can only find there. Doesn't get much better than that! There guacamole and fajitas are to die for. There fajitas combo has steak, shrimp and chicken and comes our on a hot sizzling plate with a side dish so you can build your own fajitas just to your liking. I definitely recommend the fajitas and the combination that comes with a cheese enchilada and carne asada. They're prices are very reasonable and there is something on the menu for everyone. If you are just passing through, or live in the area, Sandbar is a place you don't want to miss out on."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar!!! Great food! Service was crazy good! The salads, appetizers and dinner was great! Drinks? Oh man strong and delicious!! Definitely a great spot for dinner. Went to Sharkeez after to turn it up a bit"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I brought my cousin here for her 21st birthday and we waited in line. My friend gave the worker at the line a compliment and he told her our group was no longer welcome. He was by far one of the rudest person I have ever met. If you want to have a good time, DO NOT COME HERE."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Nice little sidewalk seating on State Street.  Good Happy Hour if your looking for a place to have a seat & snack on some chips & salsa.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Like delicious Mexican food, amazing service, affordable prices, and a super cool vibe? Me too:) And all of these are at Sandbar! You should definitely check it out when you're in downtown Santa Barbara, and when you go in, ask for Brittany:) She's the best!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is my favorite place to go downtown with my girls.  They have 3 for the price of 1 drinks on Thursday nights, which you can't find anywhere else! And the drinks are STRONG! :) My favorite thing on the menu is DEFINITELY the fish tacos. I could eat them every day! Plus, the servers are so genuinely nice and friendly. I'm definitely going back."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Went to the sandbar last night and had the most amazing time! The margaritas were delicious and the service was exceptional. Austin was so friendly and accommodating. Thanks to the great service my friends and I had a wonderful experience. We will be coming back!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"If we could give zero stars, we would.  Sadly, Natalie and I were sucked into this tourist trap with all sorts of bright shinies visible from the street.  

I ordered the Cadillac margarita, and I'm pretty sure it came from a pre-mixed bottle.  Not disgusting, but also not worth what they charge.  Our pre-meal chips were stale and the salsa was not only bland, but the knife work could have been done better by a five year old.  We had a piece of onion as big as my thumb sitting in the bowl when it was put on our table.  

Natalie got a tostada, which was really a stale fried tortilla, bland beef and an entire head of shredded lettuce. 

I ordered the nachos, which consisted of stale chips, cold beans (yes cold, even though the plate was warm), flavor-less chicken and store bought guacamole.

As we were leaving, Natalie remarked ""at least my coke was good.""  Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.  Don't go."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I can't comment on their food, but definitely a fun place to stop by on a night out on State Street! To start with, they had some nice tables outside in the fresh air (with space heaters, major bonus for anyone wearing those cute dresses that just don't go with a winter jacket). Outside we we were able to hear and enjoy the music, but could also chat without needing to read lips. Further back there was a dance floor and a DJ who a) played an awesome mix of newer and older dance-able tunes, b) didn't get stuck in a genre rut, and c) didn't try to sing along on the mic. All good signs. This place also seemed to have a bit more of a ...normal...crowd compared with some of the other bars on the street.
I would love to come by for a happy hour if I am back in SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Breakfast is terrible, I mean really, really bad food quality. I can't speak for any other meals but even the bloody mary was weak. 

It's on State St, and you get to people watch from the patio, that's pretty fun."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,I wanted to go somewhere for drinks and this place looked fun. I came here on a very busy night and the bar was packed. It was a young crowd and there was football on the tv's so the atmosphere was loud and fun. I had a beer and couple shots of tequila which was a nice night cap after a long day of traveling. It was fun here I had a good time and service was ok considering how busy it was.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Oh yeahhhhhh sandbar! This place is dope! It's named after some sort of geographical location but I wouldn't really know cuz I never paid attention in geography class, cuz you know that fly ass honey Jessica b. Sat in front of me and I was straight peepin on her every single class. They made all the tables into a maze which is a fun way to try and make it to the bar. They also got a bunch of shit on fire outside idk how this place isn't burnt to a crisp yet. But I'm no pyrotechnician, at least not yet, I have my aspirations ;) (wink). Got the tag team Brandon and Paolo behind the bar slangin dem drinks boii straight crushin it. I swear I come in for those two
Lovely faces alone. If only they would combine their beard and fro. They got dopppppeeeeeee enchiladas with mole blanco which is short for chocolate. That's right son, chocolate enchiladas, ya heard me! Don't forget they blend Mojitos their which is pretty much the most insane thing I ever heard of, go get some, bartenders love making Mojitos and they love blending stuff too. Perfect score of 5/7 would get lost in the table maze again!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Sandbar is the place to be. Tarra and Roxy are the sweetest and definitely made our night. Great vibes all around
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The drinks are watered down, so even with their happy hour 2 for 1 special you don't even get a buzz.  I guess this a way to keep the just-turned 21 SBCC and UCSB crowd to buy more drinks without turning sloppy.  Now, if just the drinks were crappy that would be one thing but we ate there the other night and my bean and cheese Tostada tasted like something had gone completely sour.  Literally, it tasted like sour, curdled milk.  I asked my boyfriend to smell it and just the foul scent made him lose his appetite.  When I told the server she took it to the kitchen and came back to tell us that they use a sauce on some of their dishes that might have a similar scent.  I replied that there was no way this could be the sauce, unless that had also gone bad.  I had a terribly upset stomach for the next two days...."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Stinky Stinky Stinkster 

Yes, it really smells like an adolescent boys' locker room in here... blecch.  

Besides that, the music was average & the drinks were so-so.  The outside patio area looked nice, but I can't recommend going inside unless you, too, want to smell like a smelly armpit."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I went to this place during happy hour, the service is sooooo slooooow, we sat by the fire and basically they ignored us for half hour, i had to literally wave my hands in the air to get attention from the waitress, but for my surprise she looked at me, turned and walked away. The service is rude and inefficient. For good beer and good food i would definitely pick somewhere else to go. Fake mediocre mexican food and slow service are def. not a good combo."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Came in tonight for late night drinks and the bar was super busy and Brandon the bartender went out of his way to make sure me and my group of friends were taken care of! Excellent service and awesome lounge atmosphere in Santa Barbara... I will recommend it to all my friends. We were
Starving and they got our last minute food order in of nachos which were amazing... Must try!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar in a nutshell is one of the best places to go to if you're looking to have a good time! The nicely decorated decor, heat lamps/fireplace and awesome service creates an ambiance that is hard to refuse. As a local, I appreciate a venue that provides entertainment and grub by day and a lively nightclub by night.

The happy hour special is also another huge plus. 2 for the price of one drinks and affordable food prices makes it hard to refuse coming in hungry and leaving satisfied. If you're looking for a great spot to drop by on State St., I definitely recommend Sandbar!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great food and good prices for portion sizes. Went with a group of 8 and got seated right away (because I asked about an empty table I could see). Service wasn't the fastest or the best - but food was!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Every time I come to Santa Barbara, we come here for lunch. This place is so good and the service is very attentive. We ordered the taco place which had 3 tacos for 6 bucks. The chips are great...I could eat bowls of it! The ambiance of the place is pretty cool too. As usual we will be back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Every time my friends and I come here it's super packed! The atmosphere is fun, and the food and drinks are good. However the last few times I've been the waitresses have sucked! All of them aren't that way, but there are a few bad apples, that's the only downer on this place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"A note to all friends past, present and future: I will never return to Sandbar. This place ranks only second to Q's in my mind as one of the absolute worst ways to waste an evening in Santa Barbara. From the trashy clientele, to the gals puking in the unsanitary restrooms, Sandbar is the epitome of all I hate about south State St bars and their ilk."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Good ambience and drinks well serve. Food was good had the Steak Nachos. Will be back when visiting Santa Barbara.  Happy Hour 2nd beer for .25 cents
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Way good food at a decent price! I've eyed this place every time I walk down State St. and finally decided to try it out.  We didn't have any problems with service, they kept our drinks filled and kept the salsa & chips coming! we loved the outdoor seating. I got the taco + enchilada....sooo good. perfect portion size too. great place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,My girlfriend and I spent a night in Santa Barbara and after night of driving we found Sandbar in Yelp.   We have to say we enjoy the music and the food was as great at reasonable prices.  Our waiter Dustin was courteous and was able to guide us to what was good on the menu.  The outside patio had heater with a good view to the band playing.  We definitely recommend this place to eat if you are in the area.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is by far my favorite bar in Santa Barbara. Beautiful ambiance with tons of outdoor seating, super cheap food and alcohol and great service. The fish and seafood are all fresh and amazing-by far the best items on the menu. I would definitely recommend this place and its the first place I take my friends and family when they come into town!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Lillian was great, she really know the menu and all her recommendations were great. Playa burrito was amazing! Lillian was very patient with our large party (12 ppl), even offered some watermelon cubes to pacify our 1 yr old little monster. Great experience, great food, and great venue!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,It took 25 minutes to get a drink and the flavor was diluted.  The ceasar saved the day
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place was really lame. And the multiply-pierced waitress literally forgot all of our orders (party of 4), and brought us each a menu item apparently of her own choosing. When told that our orders were wrong, she justified her choices as excellent and assured us that we would like them. Wow.
Almost sounds intriguing, right? Yeah, for a haute-cuisine snooty restaurant maybe. But this is the ""Sandbar"", where the waitress simply made a mistake (neigh, 4 mistakes) and was unapologetic. Maybe she should consider tattooing our orders on her bedazzled arms, which were themselves more hectic than a guido-filled friday night at this place.
Oh, and since you asked, the food was average. I suspect our actual orders would have been average as well, not that I plan on returning to find out. Holla!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great service, great atmosphere, unique seating areas outside with firepits and other unusual features.  Food was quite good and we would definitely return.  Nice convenient location too, right on State St. with parking right around the corner on Haley or Anacapa."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"So food was great but the fact that we had to wait so long for everything was a dent in the atmosphere, understaffed  ... awesome place real chill with fire pits"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Good younger crowd hang out spot with a chill atmosphere. Drinks can be pretty cheap as they have a well-drink special. They also make heavy-use of guest bartenders, which since I've known several of them means lots of free drinks. Only problem is it gets packed as hell and getting a drink can be a pain on thurs-sat nights.

Can't say much about the food, I only came here at nights to drink."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Graduated in 2003 when it was a different bar, but I like what they have done with the place. Jazzed it up...outside fire pits were golden...hot ladies all around..for sure the best spot in dt SB on a Saturday night...and I even lost my CC there...and no extra fraud on it...good people. For sure I'd hit it up next time I am in SB."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is one of the few always-packed bars in Santa Barbara on a weekend night anymore! I don't know what it is, but the fullness of each bar comes and goes like the wind. Sandbar's pupularity has stayed steadily full of customers. 

Cool outdoor patio and indoor seating is available. They've got a good sized dance floor and stage for being a bar and restaurant as well. Their bartenders are good people :) and if you want to watch football on Sunday? Here's your place! Tons of big HD TVs for your pleasure, always showing every game!

They do a great special on football Sundays - wear your favorite teams jersey or memorabilia and with each winning drive, sack, or interception your team makes, you get shot and/or drink specials!! It's called X's and O's. 

The happy hour specials: 2 for 1 beers and half off appetizers (I think). They are decent, normal bar foods. Go to Sandbar for SPORTS and for a nice crowd on the weekends!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place looked like it would be fun for lunch. Great location and the setting reminded me of being in Mexico on vacation. Sadly, we were very disappointed. The food was good, but the service terrible. Our server appeared very tired, kept yawning, walking around slowly, and playing with her cell phone instead of checking if we needed anything.There weren't many guests there at the time, so it wasn't like she was overworked. Not very friendly and just slowwwww... we had to ask for our drinks twice. The Santa Barbara mojito was so bad, I did not finish it. Not a good experience, although we did like the food."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Seriously, they have the BEST Huevos Rancheros (with a different spin) I've ever had...and I've had plenty. I have no problem making that 2hr drive from LA just for this dish. And the Chilean Seabass Ceviche, WOW! We cant visit SB or pass SB without stopping by. The service is great, their drinks are yummy and the food is legit. They open early and close late. The ambiance is friendly and chill. I've come here plenty and seriously have never had bad service."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"I went here yesterday for lunch and absolutely loved the place! We sat on the patio, the service was quick, the staff was extremely friendly and the food was so good!! I ordered the chicken enchilada and chiles rellenos plate with a jalapeño/ cucumber margarita. So, so good!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Sandbar is one of my favorite places to grab a quick dinner and a couple drinks.  Their food is very good, and the late happy hour is great for my busy schedule.  The staff also provides great service.  They are always quick with a fresh round of chips and salsa, or to refill your pints.  I definitely recommend this place."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"After many visits to the Sandbar the last visit might be the last. Last week my husband and I went with our two friends. They have a two year old and so do we. Has we drove by the restaurant we noticed there was a couple with a stroller eating at the restaurant. One of our kids was asleep so we decided to take the stroller with the sleeping child in it. 

     Once we got to the front the hostess informed us that we would have to fold the stroller and put it in a designated stroller area because we couldn't take it in the restaurant (we agreed to it) we completely understand.  What we didn't understand is why there was somebody else already sitting there with a stroller open. We didn't question it. Clair (the hostess) asked how many people were in our party. It was a total of four adults and two children. Clair asked us if we wanted to sit in the high chairs or low ones. We requested the low ones. She gave us a look and asked someone else if that would be possible. What came out of her mouth next is ridiculous! Clair said ""But the kids have to sit on a chair they can't be held because it's a hazard"".  Clair you clearly have much to learn in the world of customer service  and better yet in life!

     I contact the restaurant to file a formal complain. I spoke to one of the supervisors who apologized and said Clair was one of the newer employees. The supervisor took my name and number and assure me that the manager would contact me no later than the next day. Well it has now been three days later and I'm still waiting. 

     To an extent my party and I felt like Clair didn't want us to eat at the restaurant. I'm not sure what it is she was basing her hostility at? Was it the fact we had children with us (at 3 in the afternoon) or was it the way we looked? It's unfortunate that they have an employee of that sort has the first line of contact with the clients. With that said with so many options of restaurants on state street the Sandbar will definitely not be on our list."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"We waited over 50 minutes to get our food. Our waitress was a ditz.  Horrible service & watch your tequila. They tried to give us awful cheap tequila when we ordered their best tequila on the menu. The dingy waitress brought us 1 silver & 1 gold when we both ordered anejo shots.  Also, watch your bill we were charged for the wrong tequila & food."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Ambience is cool. Has lights all over the place and most seating are outdoor.
The food is average. I ordered the taco pollo adobo. The best thing about this place is their happy hour. Buy one and other drink is $.25 (not bad at all). Our waitress was also on top of it that's why I gave it a 4 star."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"The fajitas and margaritas on the rocks are really great here!! Fajitas are my thing and so far, Sandbar is the winner. 
Minus one star for inconsistent service; sometimes is perfectly timed and others not so much. So I gave it another chance after not so perfect experience and I wasn't disappointed...the food (fajitas, quesadillas, and chips and salsa) and margaritas are delicious!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I came here with my friends after dinner, and we got a table and some drinks. The place was super colorful and brightly lit, and most of it was part of the outside patio. It was still pretty cozy though!

Our server was nice, but she disappeared for a while and we had to look for someone else when we wanted to order more. But other than that, the service was okay.

The one thing that I didn't like as much was that there were a handful of bachelorette parties going on. There was clashing music, girls hitting on random strangers, and etc. I mean it wasn't such a big deal that it bothered me much, but it was just a little odd. And if I were having a bachelorette party, I don't think I'd want to look over at the next table and see another bride-to-be with pretty much the same thing going on there."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Fun ambiance with great music, comfortable seating, great food and great service.  Our server, Lillian was awesome!  The prices match the quality of the food.  Despite being a more Adult place, they were very kid friendly!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Love how they stay open till late and also the lively atmosphere of this place! even on a Tue night it feels like a weekend night, busy and happening. The food was good but not fabulous but after all we didn't really only for for the food and a fancy dinner. It was more about the place, good drinks and also having small dinner. Great place !"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"This place is delicious! I ordered the chicken enchiladas and sangria. I knew it was happy hour but was surprised when they brought me two drinks instead of one! It's two for the price of one, but you must get two drinks."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Great food, nice selection of margaritas - all made with fresh squeezed lime juice - with a cool, casual vibe. Lillian is an awesome server - fast and friendly with a great sense of humor. 

This is my favorite State Street restaurant. If you're feeling Mexican, this is the place to be."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Well well well. The Sandbar. What can I say? The Sandbar...was....THEY BEST cafe I have ever been to in the states. You come to America with one idea (am I right, ladies?). You come to the Sandbar with two ideas. It's more than just some bar of sand you find, it's a Sandbar, and I swear to you, as god as my witness, on my own tomb, this place is a, how you say, lace face. 

Upon walking in, you will see probably two servers at your bekon call. You don't need to acknowledge the second, only the first. The second will PROBABLY be busy already. Just don't be rude about it, you'll just look like an out of towner-- something the Sandbar is judgmental of. My meal was fantrastic and good. The best part was how the food tasted in my mouth. There was NO sand in the food ;). If you want a good meal with a good taste and a good taste in your mouth, you're going to want to try the lamb.

Thank you for listening to my review. Im sorry for bad english, still learning ;)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"So disappointed in this place, particularly the service.  My husband and I stopped by yesterday for a pre-lunch Bloody Mary, and were so disappointed in what looked like a promising bar/restaraunt. We were there BEFORE NOON ON A TUESDAY, and once the blonde waitress found out we were not staying to eat a meal, she kicked us out of the shade tables and moved us into the sun, and promptly removed our chips and salsa.  She said she needed to keep her lunch tables open (one out of about 12 were actually occupied), and our only choice was to sit in the scorching sun or inside at the bar.  She was very negletful, rude and I MAYBE would understand if it was a Saturday and the place was packed but it was EMPTY.  So upset and terrible service for a place where options to eat/drink are limitless...stay away!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This might be an okay spot for drinks, but don't come here for a meal. Average food, TERRIBLE service/security.

We went out for a late dinner on Saturday, got there around 9, and left around 10. I suppose 10 is the time when they ""transition from a restaurant to a nightclub"" because we were told that when carded again. Fair enough, you want to make sure that people don't sneak in for dinner and then stay for drinks.

However, while we were waiting for the check shortly after that, we were asked to get up so that they could switch out our table for a higher one. We told the security guy that we were waiting for the check, and would they mind waiting until we left? He says no problem, goes off. 

Five minutes later (because maybe it was a long journey to get the check?) a second security guy shows up, goes through the same routine. Gives us a hard time when we told him that we were still waiting for the check.

So, I suppose they're more focused on the nightclub crowd than the dinner crowd; keep that in mind when you go.

Also, keep in mind that many of these 5 star reviews are from people who have only reviewed the Sandbar. Maybe fake accounts? Maybe short-shorts-clad waitresses who are made to do this? Who knows."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Place is decked out nicely. Cool place to get your drink on. Smack dab in the middle of state street.  If you want good service go elsewhere, you won't find it here even on a Wednesday.  The food is the perfect for drunk cravings. Nachos with big chunks of steak, quesadilla over flowing with cheese. But its not worth ordering otherwise."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Great atmosphere and good food!  Or could it be the two for one adult beverages?
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"They had my original review deleted for reporting my experience of racism.

Long story short, they would have gotten 5 stars, but the service changed when two black guys joined our table. The servers and bartenders, who were once nice and courteous, started ignoring us and giving us the cold shoulder. 

The food was good but not worth the expense of my dignity and belief in equality."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This review is strictly for the Table Host!  The alcohol drinks were great as we had the Bloody Mary and Red Sangria.  Also we shared the Pollo Asado which was good but I thought it could have more chicken in it.  Now here's why I am complaining about this restaurant.  They have a nice outdoor seating area when we walked by on State Street. That's why we actually came here and specifically asked to sit outdoors to enjoy the nice sunny Santa Barbara.  In the middle of our meal they were seating 2 small parties and the parties asked to have the umbrella raised.  Why couldn't they have seated them in the adjacent patio area which has plenty of shade and deprive people who actually came to the restaurant to enjoy the nice outdoor seating and weather!  I don't understand it but from experience in working in the restaurant industry myself, this place seems to hire a lot of young inexperienced workers who really don't understand Customer Service!!!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Amazing service, great food, ample seating, awesome bar, and a dance floor -- What more could you ask for? We were visiting from the bay and Shotts was more than helpful in recommending some sites to see and Chelsea was the sweetest waitress we had the entire trip. Thank you for showing us a fun time. Can't wait to come back!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I was here during a business trip and ate lunch when driving from LA to San Francisco. 

This is a decent place to have some fresh fish. The waitors were very friendly. 
The location is right next to a beautiful beach."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,The fajitas was quite delicious!!!!  I enjoyed the strawberry margaritas!!  I definitely recommend.
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Has a fun vibe, fun music, good place to get drinks and food with friends. However, I felt they definitely overcharge for drinks that aren't worth the price. I ordered an old fashion (drink/price wasn't listed on the menu) and to be fair, I should have asked the price--my fault. Still, the drink ended up being $16.50, and when I asked why it was so expensive, they explained it had more bourbon. That surprised me, since the drink tasted very weak and light. So just be careful if you order classic drinks to double check the price, since they will charge you more."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I just don't get it. Why is this place always packed with a line? It's so not worth it. Not even for un-Happy Hour.

Over the years I've popped into Sandbar 3 or 4 times. It's always filled with collage kids and tourists. I'm not sure any locals actually dine here. And dine is a word I use very lightly.

The atmosphere rocks. A small bar inside with open windows for fresh air, State side high tops (only available if you're dining off the full priced menu. HH fare does not count) and a fun, open air patio filled with fire pits. I can see why you would want to stand in line to get in. While the lure of buy one get one drinks is appealing, you'll eventually be hungry and that's where the wheels fall off. 

The food is bad but the selection is good. You'll want to come in to try it and you probably will. Let's face it. The place looks cool. I've had the app sampler only to find the quesadillas cheese anemic and burnt badly around the edge. We actually cut off the tail ends not to eat the black tortilla. The taquitos were way over fired in oil that needed to be changed. Very burn taste.

Service is about as good as the food. It's hard to get your first drink, refills and the up sale pressure is too much.  

While I understand the draw, I can't imagine the repeat customer base is there. Sure the drinks are strong and the patio is inviting but that's all this two trick pony has to offer. Keep walking my friends."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Nette Sportbar mit guten Drinks.

Das Essen ist nicht schlecht. Die Burritos sind super lecker und man kriegt genug. Die Tacos sind nicht mein geschmack, liegt evt. daran dass das Fladenbrot mit Corn gemacht ist. 
Die Asada ist nicht schlecht, könnte jedoch ein wenig mehr Fleisch auf dem Teller sein.
Aber nichts desto trotz, die Preise sind gut und man  bekommt als Appetizer gratis Tortillia Chips, inkl. Dip, welche sehr lecker sind."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Came here on a Sunday night for a friends wedding after party and had a BLAST. The music here is pretty on point as they play tons of hip hop throwbacks and pop hits. We got extra service because of our wedding situation including nachos and champagne. Super glad that we ended up at this spot because it was a perfect way to end the weekend :)
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Honestly, my boyfriend and I came here because it was happy hour which is buy and drink and get another for a quarter. 

I ordered a strawberry margarita and he got a double jack and coke. To be honest with you the strawberry margarita was disgusting!

They made me a house margarita with 6 mashed strawberries in the drink! Who or how does a bartender NOT know how to make a strawberry margarita?! How can one mess that up?! 

The food was ehhh! It was not out of this world! 

I ordered enchiladas suizas with grilled corn and to say the least it was kinda bad! The corn was ""grilled"" not sure how many hours ago or days because it had a funny taste (just saying) but when I got mine it was cold! Like if they got it from the refrigerator and just slapped it on my plate! Nasty!

This place is what it is 3 stars! I never checked YELP before coming here! Wish I did and could've spent my money elsewhere like at EL TORITO! Lol 

The food and drinks were as bad as their service and 3 star ratings combined!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Great place for Happy Hour. They were very particular about where we sat if we were only there for Happy Hour. We really wanted to sit outside but for happy hour you could only sit around the fire pit or inside near the bar. Unfortunately, it was already full so we had to sit inside by the bar. It would have been nicer to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather especially since all the tables were empty. During happy hour, its order one drink and get two. We ordered a margarita which were really good. They use premixed margaritas which usually I don't enjoy but they were surprisingly ok. We also got nachos (appetizers are 1/2 off for happy hour until 7pm). They were tasty and came with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, beans and jalapenos. Not bad for around $3. I definitely wouldn't want to eat here for dinner because the food didn't look authentic or appealing but it was a great choice for happy hour drinks. We ended up ordering 3 margaritas (so we got 6) and 1 appetizer and our bill was around $25 so great deals!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Where to begin?! Fiesta weekend was simply madness downtown, but Sandbar did not allow the madness to affect their performance! I go to sandbar frequently as it is one of favorite restaurants here in SB. 
I went in tonight, Sunday, with a group of friends and wasn't disappointed in the slightest. The service was impeccable from the start. There were 2 hostesses at the stand, but Nicolette was the one to help us. Her lovely smile and quick accommodation to our requests was delightful. We sat on the patio, our favorite spot, and our server Jessilyn (spelling?) continued our good vibes. 
On top of the wonderful service the food was to die for, like always. The fajitas are always our favorite. 
Sandbar has always been one of my go-to places and their performance during the Fiesta craziness only solidified for me that I will continue going to this great place! 
Amazing staff, food, and atmosphere! You'd be crazy not to go! 
Keep it up Sandbar :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"A group of friends came into town for a bachelorette weekend... 
We were just stopping in for lunch on our first afternoon in town and after casually chatting with our waitress, they suggested some bachelorette festivities later on in the evening. 
For the most affordable price I've ever experienced, we got the royal treatment! Their hospitality team is quite dedicated to making a girls' night special! 

I HAD to deduct a star because the bathroom situation after 10pm is atrocious! Not only were the patrons scary and rude, but the bathroom 'guard' was the meanest man I've ever encountered! There was a girl throwing up in the sink, couldn't hold herself up, and rather than help her or see if she needed help, she just yelled at us to close the door. I understand there's codes and whatnot, but his excessive rudeness was the reason half our party left early, they literally said ""I would have stayed but I didn't want to use that bathroom at all!""... yikes. 

Other than that, food and drinks were great as well as our bachelorette's impromptu party. :)"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"I would give it zero stars if I could...

My friends and I went to SB for the day, and thought Mexican food and drinks would be a good plan for lunch.  Once we finally got seated, it took our waitress about 20 minutes to actually acknowledge us despite attempts to wave someone down.  She took our order in a jiffy, she must have been super busy with that ""large party"" in the back (aka 10 people).  While we waited for our food we had some delicious mojitos (the best part about our time at Sandbar).  Our food arrived maybe 30 min later.  After we ate it took another 20-30 minutes for someone to clear our plates.  Then another 15 minutes to get the check.  We actually walked our bill up to the waitress to speed up the process.  Our quick lunch turned into a 2 hour wait session.

The food was alright - nothing to write home about.  Like I said, the drinks were the best part.  I don't think we were ever offered water.  And we didn't even get chips and salsa.

Skip Sandbar."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,I was here during happy hour. The house margarita was ok..nothing special but the appetizers were great. Shrimp enchillada!!
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,"Love this place. Always smells like fajitas in there. I'd check out the half Asian bartender J Shots, he likes to give massages while you eat and not in an awkward way.. The little guy behind the bar named Richie was quite amenable to my guy and girlfriends!"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Came on Monday (Labor Day Wkend)...Took my parents out with the boyfriend for some hanging out in SB and relaxing. 

Unfortunately for us, a lot of the shops/restaurants were closed on Labor Day so our lunch options were quite limited but we stumbled into Sandbar because of it's lively atmosphere, outdoor seating and Happy Hour. I yelp'd it and kind of knew what to expect but just went with it cuz everyone was hungry.

Happy Hour (4 pm - 8 pm) - 2 stars
2 for 1 drinks sounded good until your glasses came and you realized your 2 drinks probably equate to 1 full drink. My skinny margarita was served in a small wine glass and since it was happy hour I got 2 but each glass only took me about 4 sips to finish. Weak. HALF OFF APPETIZERS ONLY AVAILABLE AT BAR. 

Chips & Salsa - 1 star
Nothings worst than getting served STALE CHIPS at a mexican restaurant. They sprinkle seasoning salt on the chips which probably isn't really necessary maybe they thought that would hide the staleness of the chips. 1 chip out of every 5 was probably crispy. 

Combo Appetizer Platter - 2 stars
All fried food except for the quesadilla and all mediocre at best. Chicken tenders were hard on the outside. All else was ehh..

Combo Fajita Plate - 1 star
They fold your tortillas and slap them onto a plate with all the condiments. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with this except I like eating my food hot and not covering the tortillas in foil or anything means that after I finish my 1st wrap the rest are going to be hard and cold. Wtf! I asked the busser to bring me some foil and he didn't seem to understand what for. How is this OK?! Am I being that difficult? I just figure the Chef (If there is one) would understand this concept and would serve the toritillas covered so people didn't have to eat cold tortillas. The fajita platter itself was very weak. Standard and nothing special.

Burrito Plates - 1 star
Burritos are weak and they charge an extra $2.50 for side of rice and beans which make the burrito plate come out to almost $15 and this was NOT a $15 tasting burrito. 

I would not come back here. All the food is mediocre at best and their HH is really weak. The only thing they have going for them is that they're on State Street. 

The food needs a revamp bad. It's a poor attempt of white friendly mexican food at white people prices."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"This place kinda makes me sick to my stomach, but if you're into seeing dudes give girls jello shots through fat syringes go for it"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"The food and the service was alright so I forsure preferred the club aspect of this venue. 

I think the restaurant tries so hard to be 'authentic Mexican' that it feeds into the stereotypical perception of Mexicans/Mexican cultures (mustaches and sombreros during Cinco de Mayo -__-).

If you do go to this place I would recommend the fajitas"
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,positive,Very delicious food ... waitress was amazing! Amazing bar and a good restaurant atmosphere of freedom no doubt
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"NO.

just no.

The place was empty (not the kind of empty where only one waitress is handling a whole section so they needed to keep some of it empty, empty in that there were 3 tables filled) when my friends and I rolled in for lunch and we still had to wait at the bar for a table.

This wasn't too bad cause we could start round 1, however, once we got seated, it took another 25 minutes for someone to come by to take our order so we could wait another 30 to get the appetizer. 

This sounds like a review a vengeful ass would post so I'll try to find at least one redeeming quality. You know what, the only thing I can think of is that they have a liquor license. That's the only thing this place has going for it."
EtM079Cj7-B3G7jPsGYb_Q,Sandbar,Mexican,negative,"Went here for after dinner drinks with one of my friends and was disappointed by the crowd of young college kids (all underage, by the way) who were coming in and being super rowdy. This was around 9:30pm. We sat outside on a cool evening by the fire which was nice, but there are other places on State Street that have better drinks and a better atmosphere if you're in your mid-20s or early 30s.

BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"We headed to Super Cucas on a Sunday afternoon and I drove right past it.  This location is sort of hard to find, hidden right before the over pass.

I ordered the veggie tacos and it was pretty good -- the only weird thing is that the tortillas were on the bottom of all the veggies making it impossible to actually eat a ""taco"".  The portion was pretty large.

My friends ordered a carnitas nachos -- very good with guacamole and sour cream, and a pork plate which was pretty good too and it was also a huge portion.  

The price was affordable and the taste authentic.  Overall, it's not a bad choice if you're hankering for mexican food."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Originally started out in a 40 person line at La Super-Rica's until we realized we could probably have equally good tacos and dine with the locals at Super Cuca's. 

I had two soft tacos - one carne asada and one pastor. The beef (carne asada) was a bit chewy and lacked flavor. The pastor (marinated pork), on the other hand, was full of flavor and perfectly cooked. Combined with the fresh cilantro and onion, I was hooked. Ordering two was definitely ambitious though. Unless you haven't eaten all day, one is plenty. The meat portions are generous and each taco order comes with two corn tortillas. 

Hubby had the pastor burrito which didn't disappoint. The marinade from the pork seeped into the wrap and the well-seasoned red rice made it an overall win. The burrito portions are also generous so you are sure to leave with that ""excuse me while I unbutton my pants"" feeling. But isn't that what Mexican food is all about?"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,The best mexican food in town. This little spot has a wonderful outdoor seatng area. Everything from here is great especially the salsa! I'm super cuckoo for super cuca's

BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Good for the price and quantity you get. I mean the quality of the produces is definitely not the best and the meat is better at Lilly's, but it's fast, cheap, the portions are huge and pretty tasty. So as far as cheap taqueria goes, Cucas is worth a shot especially their HUGE burritos (The American one with French fries is original) and their Tortas (the taste made me think of a Mexican version of In n Out)"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Everyone gets the burritos here. They are huge. I never thought they were anything too special, but still good. You can also get plates with rice and beans. Carnitas, tacos, tortas. I love the little icecream box where you can get paletas.Yum Yum Yum. My only complaint is that more than a few times when getting a veggie burrito, I've found meat in it. The horchata is good."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Why haven't more people reviewed this??  Fat, greasy, tasty, authentic burritos!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I crave this place! Probably the best and cheapest Mexican food you can get in Santa Barbara. The meat is pretty salty and sometimes a little sketch, so I stick to the burrito with just beans, rice, cheese, and avocado. Super filling and always delicious. Never pass up on the green and red salsas- they're usually pretty good and have a nice kick."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"LOVE IT!! 
Super burrito with carne Asada.. hold the onions!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,This location is horrible with their customer service the first time they bring me my tacos cold I took them back to get hot ones and they just heated them up in the microwave and didn't bother to take my lettuce off the plate so I got hot wilted lettuce along with a stale crunchy tortilla the second time they said I had to buy salsa for my food ridiculous great food just horrible people running it !!!!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"This place had such good reviews so I was super excited to try it. I ordered the carne asada taco plate with beans. The meat portion was generous and came on doubled up corn tortillas with onions and cilantro...just how I like it. The pinto beans are basic and weren't too impressive. They offer a couple types of sauces, a habanero red and a green. I had the green sauce and it was probably the best part about the tacos!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,I went to school at SDSU and can comment on Cali burritos...this was worth it while up here. Enough said.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,This place has been a local staple for decades. They are the best place for a burrito in the whole county with out a doubt.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Incredible and HUGE carnitas burrito. Great stop on the drive down the 101.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Heard all the raves about this place. We ordered the RCB burrito, carne asada quesadilla and the Chile releno dinner. It wasn't bad food, just not what we expected. The burrito was mostly rice, with very little cheese and beans. The quesadilla was most meat on a big folded tortilla and I had to add a lot of cheese. 

Disappointed, as I thought I was going to really enjoy this place."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Love the hole in the wall mexican decadence of their enormous carnitas tacos! No fuss, no muss, just great authentic food with killer salsa! Definitely a great place to splurge!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"The burritos were pretty good, portion control has no place here and the prices are just right.  The Nachos- not bad but not great either.  The toppings were wonderful!  The cheese was not melted nor sufficient to leave a decent layer.  I would perhaps just stick with the monster burrito to fill a gut. The service was otherwise fabulous and quick."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"OMG, this place was so good. The carne asada was so tasty! I got the super nachos(huge) they can and should be shared with many friends. My husband got the soft tacos asada. They came with a mound of meat and beans on corn tortillas. Our whole Bill with a coke was less than $20. The people that worked there  were nice. The atmosphere was like a taco stand more than a restaurant. It was busy so that tells a lot about the food. I say a must go for authentic Mexican taco stand food."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I really haven't tried too much here but I'm happy with what I order.  I mainly order off the kids menu (which all items are a perfect, non-intimidating yet filling size) and I'm happy every time.  The super quesadillas and burritos could probably feed 3 grown folks--no lie.  They certainly are not stingy with loading on the ingredients!  Food is made to order and it comes out fast.  Good prices.  It's a greasy, divey joint, yes, but you don't need a song and dance with all your meals right?  You place your order at the counter and pick it up at a window.  Easy enough! 

Some of the things in the carneceria are a bit scary but the marinated tri tip has come in handy for many a BBQ.  It's cut up thin and seasoned just right."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"It wont let me leave a comment unless I rate it, which I don't think it deserves. So let's just get to it.  Having been born and raised in Santa Barbara, from a latino family, I have to warn others about this FAKE Mexican food, and by fake I mean, they try to pass shit quality food as authentic mexican food. I have been eating at Cuca's since they opened. At first the food was fantastic, I think mostly due to the fact that at the time they opened there were not that many places around town like it. After the novelty wore off, the food was consistently good. Now, after many many years the food has been consistently shitty. Today was my limit. I can no longer pretend that the food is good. I'm deeply saddened by the poor quality. In particular, the Chicken was disgusting. NOT FRESH, the chicken was dry, dark, bland, rubbery and tasted like refrigerator for christs sake! The inconsistency of the chicken pieces, some small, some huge, some werent cut all the way through. There was cartilage, and weird fatty chunks!! Im absolutely disgusted with the lack of effort put into cooking. I'm 100% convinced whoever prepared this food does not like what they do for a living. I'm beyond disgusted right now. Needless to say, I will no longer be a patron of Cuca's. Not to mention, the price for what I got was a total rip off. I refuse to pay for garbage. I spent $30 on crap I wouldn't feed my dog."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Fat and tasty burritos....need I say more?
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,giant puppy sized burrito. huge nachos with everything. fast. perfect for hungry people and local. normal prices. true blue santa barbara style. thanks.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Nom, nom nom!  One of my favorite haunts from back in the day when I lived in SB.  Love the outdoor patio and the salsas.  Not cheap, but what is in Santa Barbara?  Anyway, Still love it after about 15 years."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"BIG burritos. I was not super hungry because i just ate. But my burrito was sooo big! Really good too. I only got through half of it and i felt accomplished. I ordered the Diet Burrito. No meat, just beans rice avocado salsa lettuce. Unlike most places there was so much avocado it was amazing. Most places treat it like gold, here they were sharing the wealth."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Breakfast burrito was very good! The salsas (both red and green) weren't my favorite, but the habanero salsa was great for a mild hangover. Fast, efficient, and friendly service. I'll be back next time I'm in SB!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I love this place! Quality food with great flavor, fast and friendly service and portions you could share - but I won't. The nachos are actually served on a plate that is bigger than my head!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,You have to know what to order when you go here. Get the super nachos and a horchata. Do not get a burrito. If you stick to my advice you will love it.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Sooooo good. Great breakfast burrito. Quick service polite employees. I was pleased !!!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Best Carne Asada burrito anywhere. No, I'm not kidding, and yes, I know people say that stuff all the time. Trust that I'm not steering you wrong. 

Get the Carne Asada super burrito. 

Pro Tip: Dont be cheap and buy extra salsa verde."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"This is my go-to spot for fast food mex.  The burritos are huge, the Tortas as massive, and the Nachos are two meals in one.  I am not going to say this is the best place ever in SB but, if your looking for a good ole downright good tasting mex, come here.  They have 3 locations, starting with the original on the westside.  They Make some pretty mean breakfast burritos too.  I go to the original location because of the carnicaria that is located inside.  Great stuff to take home and do on your own grill too.  I usually get the three hard shell tacos for 4.99 and get my grub on.  I like all the burritos here and love the tortas.  They have all the fix'ns ya want, and if your brave try the Habanero salsa.  Fun spot, cheap, and you wont leave here hungry."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Decided to try this place because the reviews were good, and they seemed to be one of the only places still open at 9:30pm. We are visiting Santa Barbara and got into town late. After driving through a residential neighborhood, we came to this hole in the wall Mexican market/ restaurant. A little reluctant to stay and eat outside, we ordered to go. We ordered the super nachos with carne asada & a super burrito with carne asada. The plus....the portions are huge! We should have ordered 1 item and split it. The burrito was good, I would recommend getting that here. The nachos however were not satisfactory. There was very little cheese, a few strands, that were NOT melted. A ton of meat & beans & cream though. They were a little cold, and the carne asada was bland. Not much taste, you have to use a lot of salsa to perk it up. Bottom line, I would not go out of my way to return here. It was so so. Didn't see the 5 stars or even 4 that others put."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"The hood,  I love my neighborhood comida... cant go wrong here,  the portions are big,  the environment is bomb,  dont trip... this is a great place."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Best burritos in town. Also a nice little market to boot.

Friendly staff, great prices. Cant go wrong with anything on the menu"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Good customer service. Food is great, although a little expensive, however the California burrito comes with guacamole and sour cream so that makes it worth it"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Love the mom and pop feel and love that they also run a little market in the building!! I was able to buy a ready to eat avocado and added it right then and there to my Super Plate with my chicken and chili verde
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,I LOVE this place!! Super good and inexpensive! Went there everyday that I was in Santa Barbara!!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Great food large portions. The shrimp tacos were delicious. Shrimp tacos, taco, and taco combo all for around $20"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"As previously stated, yet cannot be said enough, this place has the best asada burritos in sb."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"While this is not the best small Mexican place I've been to, it was nonetheless authentic tasting and filling. I had Al Pastor tacos with rice and beans. The meat was not quite as seasoned as I've had at other places--especially for Al Pastor--but it was still very good. The staff was also friendly, the place was clean, and it was easy to get on and off the freeway. If I was in the area again, I would not hesitate to eat here again."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"This is one of my favorite restaurants around town. I've had many of their burritos, tortas, and nachos, and I've never been disappointed. The food is delicious, and the portions are huge. The employees there are always friendly to me, and the lines are never very long. The parking lot is a bit cramped and sometimes fills up, but they're in a neighborhood with lots of street parking within a very short walk. They have daily specials, and I love being able to get a high quality burrito for a pretty cheap price (by Santa Barbara standards)."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Good meat, great salsa. Ordered two Asada tacos, they were Yoooooge! Meat was well seasoned, I don't like beans, but they went well with the meat. Wife had a carnitas burrito, she loved it. Great spot for fast and delicious Mexican food."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Don't see the hype about this place.  Burritos are all over $10 with nothing super special about them.  I didn't hate it but I feel there have got to be better burritos in town.  

On the market side things seemed good.  Lots of choices of different meats at decent prices and a variety of rice, chilies, spices, and beans.  

Maybe a place to buy stuff to make burritos but not a strong recommendation on buying your burrito here."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Such great employees working tonight August 6th! Eric Ramono was amazing I asked him for an altering menu item an he was positive sweet and amazing, he was only nice !  Please treat these people amazing they are so nice!!!!!  Not only did he make sure he got my order right he actually made sure it was made/delivered correct! He was very sweet and customer attentive and very determined at his job."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I been coming here since I was a kid, I will confessed the cheer volume of the super burrito has scare lesser men away. Not me since I can remember I have made it my point to finish everything I start. Conquering every meal, both regular and large, I never quit."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Best burritos in town - in my humble opinion!  Actually all the food is excellent.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Kim Cameron, Valencia, CA
This place is good, but not the best! My friend & I used to joke that the food would give us stomach ""issues"", if you know what I mean... :/ I always get cheese enchiladas because they are my favorite Mexican food, & Rose Cafe's are much better (the sauce especially). Sorry Super Cuca's!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"3 crispy taco plate was a small mountain of food with abundant guacamole, sour cream and your choice of meat nestled in thin but crisp taco shells, adorned with salsa fresca. I chose one each of carnitas, pastor, and asada. All were solid. Devoured with squirts of excellent green and red salsa, these tacos had me at hola! Next time, will ask for no cheese, however, because the cold shreds added nothing."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,One of the Best Carne Asada Burritos I ever had. It was exploding with flavor. Love that they put a lot of Mexican cheese that melts in there with a lot of Guacamole and Sour Cream. Super Burrito is like a 2lbs. Burrito. Great customer service and great prices. Parking can get kind of tight during busy hours. Parking lot is for 10 cars. But there is also parking in the street. I would definitely come back. Love that they are open all day everyday.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"The best burritos in town and surrounding areas!! The staff is also friendly and helpful. Parking may be a bit of a challenge if you come on a busy day ie, everyday? lol. My fave is the shrimp burrito: OMG, steamy hot, loaded with veggies and tons of shrimp. I haven't found a burrito that can seriously challenge this one for the #1 Spot; Not even in East Los... :/   Enjoy!!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I got the Cali burrito and my husband got the protein breakfast burrito. Burritos are huge, however, mine was not wrapped very well and fell apart after 2 bites.  Neither of our burritos had much meat on them and mine was like eating a bite of just sour cream and guacamole on one side and fries on the other."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Super Cuca's has a killer salsa verde. My friends and I usually trade the red sauce back for extra verde. I was recently told to try the ""meat & cheese"" option on the menu (basically nachos with french fries instead of tortilla chips) with carne asada (steak), extra cheese & sour cream, no pico de gallo. Done. Delicious. Eat while hot or else fries get soggy. Burritos are bomb too."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,This place is walking distance from my house and often my choice for my dinner with left overs for lunch. Its a small place but its got plenty of seating and I can take my dog because its all outside seating. They also have a small market inside that has good prices on meat and veggies. I love their super plate and fish tacos.....oh and nachos!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"This place could potentially be great but unfortunately my vegetarian burrito has had chunks of beef in it not once, but twice now. I don't think I will return."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"For a burrito that cost $8 I expect enough meat in the burrito. I ordered a super asada burrito and got a massive burrito. However, when I dug into my first bite I discovered it was mostly beans n rice. Approx 75% b n r and 25% asada. I wouldn't have minded if the beans had more flavor and rice was bland. I won't be coming back. Save your $ go somewhere else."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I used to love this place, until yesterday. We ordered 3 burritos to go. We asked for two of them without rice. Not only did we get rice, but A LOT of it. Our entire burritos we all rice. It seemed that they did it on purpose. I usually don't give negative reviews at all, but this was not a good experience. If you ask for something particular, make sure you check it before you leave."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Great if you want some authentic spin of the border mexican food. They also have some American twists on their menu such as the fries with meat which is essentially nachos but with French fries instead of chips. The workers are always so nice no matter what time you come and they always give you plenty of salsa.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,Just had the nachos and they changed the way they are cooking the chicken  or something. It was awful. Barely ate it. What a bummer
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Unexpectedly huge portions, and a great little market to shop in while you wait for your order. Love this place!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Get the Asada quesadilla and you will have 3 lbs of cheese and meat and its heaven on earth! I love this place. Definitely not the best area of SB but worth it!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Recently stopped in for lunch during a weekend trip to Santa Barbara with friends. Between us we sampled several of the tacos and burritos.

This is a small, dive-y place, half grocery and half drive-in-style restaurant. The food is inexpensive and portions are generous, especially the burritos.

My friend said the pork burritos were ""amazing"" and quite memorable. The burritos ranged from good to mediocre. I had the carne asado, and felt that while the fillings were good and fresh (but too much rice), the meat itself was substandard. Not only did it entirely lack any typical carne asado flavor (no grilled taste at all, for example), the quality was low - it was very gristly on top of lacking flavor. The other burritos received similar if slightly better reviews from my friends, but none were exceptional.

If I returned I would order the tacos and skip the burritos."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"This taqueria is excellent value for the price, probably one of the best in town, IMHO. The habanero salsa is not terribly spicy, but has a very nice flavor and goes well on my favorite plate, the Super Plate, which comes with two tortillas and enough food to make two sub-super burritos! Add cheese and avocado for a couple extra $ and you are feeding two people for about $13 before drinks."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Ranks up there with some of the top spots in SB for Mexican food.  This places gets it right by giving you bottles of salsa not dinky plastics cups. A plus is that the market carries the same meats and marinated meats that the restaurant uses. So you can pick up a few pounds of perfectly marinated carne asada for a cookout at your house or a park or something.  Great prices, everything you need all in one place for a great Mexican meal or cookout."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Seriously the best Mexican food you will ever, ever have. It's not like Super Ricas, which is also very authentic and it's not like a taco truck on a corner in LA, it's totally unique. I ALWAYS get the al pastor taco-- the meat is marinated to perfection and they grill it with thinly sliced zucchini, onions, mushrooms and I swear to god it must have crack in it because it's that good. Add beans, sprinkle a little queso on top and shovel it over a huge flour tortilla and you're ready to rock. The burritos are also good, but it's so much food that I had to dial it back because I was getting a little tight in the jeans."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Let me start with the facts, or one fact - I am from San Diego originally and LOVE Mexican food. This is not good Mexican food - this is huge portions of fattening unsatisfying ingredients stuffed in a tortilla. Every time I have eaten here for a late night snack or quick lunch, I am disappointed and suffering for hours with a painful food belly from the meal. REAL Mexican food is fresh and worth every calorie, while this is just bad food that continues to get away with selling itself as ""real Mexican"".

After trying this place a couple of times - I find it consistently disappointing."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"YUM!  The carnitas here were to die for, and I agree with other reviewers, the burritos are enormous, so go hungry!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I found this Restaurant by utilizing Yelp and the Positive reviews and let me tell you the Fuss is REAL!!! The food was DELICIOUS the Customer Service was one on one it felt welcoming having such great personal assistance. I travel for work quiet a bit so I'm always looking for new places to enjoy a quick meal... I ordered The Shrimp Nachos (added Pastor cause that just sounded odd but they were delicious lol) as well ordered Asada fries based on one of the reviews and I concur they were Yummy!! I look forward in recommending others to experience the authentic food, positive vibes, and satisfaction to their belly's!!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Love this place, great authentic Mexican food with meat market on site.  Very large portions, very affordable."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,I love this place. The meats are very good and they are not skimpy servings. Whenever I go to San Andreas Hardware I step across the street to get a bite. Yums the word.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,I come here all the time i always get the bean and cheese burrito great deal for $4.96 they need more salsas though
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"My introduction to Super Cucas started in Isla Vista in the summer of 2005(?) maybe 2006? when I believe the sons of the original Super Cucas opened up the #3 location.  For the first week, every item on the menu was .50!!!  I ate there breakfast lunch and dinner for the whole week and they had me every since.

When they introduced their breakfast menu, I fell in love all over again!

I then moved out of isla vista and in to downtown SB - In my search for local eateries, I came across Super Cucas again on Micheltorena, I believe this is the original location.  Same great food - same great breakfast options - its all here and its just as good as the IV location (of course it is - its the original!).

Every now and again, the chicken can be a little dry - but when its not, its delicious!  I usually judge the mexican places in town for their chicken - this place definitely has a unique method of preparation to give it a flavor only found in town - I love it."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"When people ask me if there is only one thing I could eat for the rest of my life, my answer is and will always be Super Cucas. This is the greatest mexican food restaurant I've ever eaten at. Super cheap, great friendly staff, best best best burritos."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"The best breakfast burritos in town by far! So delicious and decently priced. 

The tacos is also a great option for lunch or dinner. So much food for around $6! Piled with rice and bean on the side to fill you up. There is a small outdoor seating area with heat lamps for when it gets colder."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,HUGE HUGE HUGE burritos!  And extremely delicious.  Fast and friendly and cheap and great.  Pastor is bomb and so are the grilled veggie burritos.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Great place! Lots of food. I ordered a quesadilla this last time and it was draping over all sides of the plate and full of chicken. They dont kid around here!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Quality grub for the top shelf heads. Shouts out to Javier in the back, really stepped up his game."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Ah, Super Cuca's.... I miss you.  I ate here at least 3 times a week when my partner lived on San Pascal 8 years ago, and then pretty regularly when we moved to Kowalski street.  Every trip home to SB involves a stop here to Cuca's.

Very reasonable prices - the food is excellent:  I have had many things on the menu, but lately have been addicted to the Super Nachos, no meat.  My brother loves their Carne Asada Torta, my mom loves the Chicken tostadas, and ... well its just all good.  I also get a large hortchata, and do a little shop for Mexican spices while I am waiting for my food.

So, inexpensive.  More standard Mexican fair than Tex-Mex or California Style Mexican food, quick service (no wait staff) order at front, pick up at side window.  Their salsa verde is the bomb.  Huge portions... I have never left there hungry, and have usually had leftovers.

The parking lot is atrocious, and I recommend parking elsewhere and walking over."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Split a breakfast burrito with your significant other (trust me, you probably won't be able to eat a whole one on your own) for a filling and cheap breakfast. The chili relleno breakfast burrito is to die for, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. LOVE this place."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Decided to try a different Mexican restaurant hoping that the food would be good. I was very disappointed. We ordered hard shell tacos that had chunks of chicken and came without  lettuce, tomato, cheese, cilantro . The enchiladas flavorless. The nachos had very little cheese with chunks of chicken rather than shredded. The rice was flavorless as well. My daughter ordered taquitos with shredded chicken and was one of two things that were good.  The beans had good flavor."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,cool place had a taco and a burrito here...the price is very cheap i paid about $8 bucks for those two items without drink the food was great..will come back to it again
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Too much greasy mediocre food. Tastes great late night when your drunk, but watch out next day. Be careful using credit/debit as they overwrite tip"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Got carne Asada tacos from this place and they were the worst I've tasted. The meat was totally plain and had no flavor whatsoever. the taste buds of the people that write good reviews are off, cause I've had better."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Super Cuca's is a great Mexican cafe as part of a small grocery store. Covered and sunny outdoor patio seating. The food is authentic and served on large platters and was prepared very well!  Watch the house hot sauce - it is HOT!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I believe I had their vegetarian breakfast burito, or veggie burrito.... it was gross! They had some flavor they put on their vegetables, not delicious at all, quite sickening... Only their nachos are good to me."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,A good place to go when you want something quick and cheap. I always either get their rancheros burrito or their cheap special any time of day. My boyfriend loves their steak and fries. A great place to places to go order.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"So my fiance and I went one night food was good hard carnitas tacos guacamole chesse sour cream pico de Gallo . The next day we went and I ordered the same thing they gave me a soft taco with cilantro and onions and beans I went to correct my order I never  ever do this ethier but I was craving the same thing we had the night before. So I went inside I told the lady what I wanted she talked with the cashier in spanish and then yelled at me saying no next time u say "" cashew taacco"" I was like I ordered the same thing last night she continued yelling at me ""you next time say cashew tacko!!!""I was like how do u say that... u meant to say crunchy right she kept argue with me and talking back and forth with the cashier.  FUCK IT'S JUST ONE TACO!!!! Wtf!!!!!  You just lost two customers good for you ....Ok food  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T GO HERE!!!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"As good as it gets for a 10$ mexican street food dinner
Try the shrimp quesadilla!!!
And they serve Pacifico any time
A must do in Sta Barbara for Mexican foodies"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"this super cucas location is pretty delicious but it also get pretty packed due to their lack of a parking lot (it is always packed and very difficult to get out of) as well as it being a little grocery store inside as well. They have delicious carne asada, super fresh and their assortment of salsas and sauces really spice the meat up. Their portions are also HUGE so if you get a large burrito, quesadilla or nachos do share that way you won't go home with a ton of leftovers."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"If you want great Mexican food but aren't on the verge of starvation, you may want to consider sharing a plate. All portions are huge! And delicious! Breakfast burritos all day long!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"La Bomba!

""Top 5 burritos of all time,"" and that's as bold of a statement as I'll make.  Everything is good, fresh, and I want to rub it all over my face.

Need I say more?  ""Top 5 burritos of all time.""  Eat here.

Auf."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Who are you kidding?  In the world of Taquerias, Cuca's is as good as it gets.  And, let me tell you, it is the call of home when I have been abroad.  

Years ago I lived around the corner, back when the century started with 19--.  They opened and have steadily honed their craft.  There is nothing special about the old revamped Foster's Freeze building, and do not let the fresh meat grocery smell fool you.  You are going to love it!  Yes, the burritos are Gi-normous, and cheap, and you can get rocked by the Torta plate, but let me share two secrets with you.  Order the Nachos...cause they do not get any better, and snag one of those plastic squeeze bottles of Green Salsa before you sit and feast.  

Nachos, considered to be a holy grail food by my friend and I are the best you can find.  Crisp chips, cheese for days, quac, scream, and we say the most chicken you can imagined plied high.  Squired with the salsa verde, you will go away fat and sassy, wondering when you will be hungry enough to come back and do it all over again.  

Are you on a budget?  Cuca's is the place.  A burrito can be at least two meals.  One more mention, I know this was not the choice of the late great Julia Childs, but only because she was not aware of it yet.  If you like Mexican cuisine, try the rice.  Who ever came up with their recipe, your are a wizard!  I know I mentioned the Salsa Verde before, but let me tell you, it inspired me to go home and figure out how to make it myself...it is that good!  Kudos Cucas!  Stay the course."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Love it! Not the most healthy but it tastes amazing and staff is supper friendly.

Theres a few in SB- for a cheap eat- GO!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Bomb burritos, salsas are on point.  Plus a little Mexican tienda for all kinds of other food and groceries. No inside seating,  only outdoor patio seating under a covered roof."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"If you have been through college you learn a few things. Algebra, Shotgunning PBR, bongs made from faucets/apples, and where to get a great burrito. Obviously we can't keep up with a lot of these skills after college, but one that stuck with me was the ability to analyze a good burrito. A burrito is a simple thing, meat, beans, cheese, rice and a tortilla. Simple right? Done right, it is true artistry. Growing up in Santa Barbara County is was what led me here. It is the Louvre of Burrito joints, not because it is a beautiful venue, but because the burritos they create here are art. Carnitas cooked to perfection, beans like none other.

This is the real deal. I've ate countless burritos in my days on this earth. It's a place I always go when I go back home."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"The fact that this place is right around the corner from our house, is dangerous. The staff is always so friendly and in good spirits. This is where I go when I'm hungover and I get the chicken taquitos or the carne asada California burrito with a wheat tortilla- both of which are sooooo amazing!!! Their tacos are so good too. Really have never been disappointed. My boyfriend really likes their carnitas and nachos. This place is da bomb."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Casual & inexpensive with great food.  Did I mention the huge portions?  Love the market too - it's a favorite place to stock up  with all of the ingredients for making carne asada tacos at home. Try the marinated (preparada) beef with grilled veggies and you'll be hooked.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,This is by far the best go to Mexican restaurant with amazing tasting food.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,If you're looking for a to go burrito that's homemade then come here. I got a protein burrito which was beef eggs cheese and potatoes. I call in so it's fast and by the time I get there I don't have to wait. It's about $7 for the burrito which was pretty reasonable. I ate the whole thing and was full the whole day lol. You can sit down and eat at the restaurant but I wouldn't really recommend it.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Stopped here on the way home for lunch. I'm torn--on one hand, it's your standard burrito/taco joint. On the other, the portions are huge and the service nice. There's a good outdoor seating space, always a bonus. But the food was just ok. We live in a majorly Hispanic area, so I'm used to top-notch burritos and tacos. These were only so-so. The carne asada was tough and flavorless. The guac was good, though--thumbs up. My husband's burrito was huge and seemed to be packed with the carnitas he ordered, but the balance between the rice beans and meat was off (too much rice.) All in all, a solid place but not the best ever."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"This is an awesome, local burrito spot.  Lots of character and flavor to everything they have.
   If you love burritos, you will LOVE this spot.  I have been going here for 15 years at least."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Met up here with my brother for lunch, he lives and works in Santa Barbara and he swears by this spot. I now know why. This is not your run of the mill Carniceria (meat market)/Taco spot, this place is really freaking good!!! Hate to admit it, but if it was any closer to home, then it too woukd be my go to for quick Mexican food. I ordered the Al Pastor Super Nachos, my brother ordered the Super Plate with Asada, and my daughter had RBC (she always gets Rice Bean & Cheese burritos). She said the rice and beans taste ""just like the ones Abuelita makes."" (Spanish for Grandma). You gotta get the NACHOS!!!!!!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Absolutely delicious! And fast too! I got the super burrito with al pastor meat and my boyfriend got the California burrito with al pastor. They were both HUGE and the meat was so well seasoned and cooked perfectly. We will definitely be returning!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Man you will not go home hungry from here. This is now one of my favorite places to eat in Santa Barbara.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"A five star taco shack!
Excellent.  We live in Ventura and was told I must eat here next time I was in town.  Check it out.  Two taco plate was huge.  Burritos are excellent."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Great burrito place- get the carnitas. Giant burritos. Today I had the wet red sauce burrito. Friendly service, quick, cheap, lots of parking and tables to eat at."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Bacon, egg, cheese and potato breakfast burrito was SO good!! Super fast service and DELICIOUS."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Ok for the super burrito with streak a definite 5 star burrito. And the red sauce is out of this world!!!!!! I am a regular and highly recommend Supper Cucas for a great lunch. Even worth driving out of the way for it.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I have been going to Super Cuca's for several years and they have delicious Mexican food! The staff is really friendly, always greeting you with a big smile and the owner always asks to see how your day is going. My favorites are the shrimp quesadilla which is to die for, there El Pastor Super Burrito and their Tortas! Everything is super yummy, with fresh ingredients and they use the most delicious cheese!  There is even a little market inside where they sell fresh seafood and meats and a small deli. They have plenty of outdoor seating but no indoor available so it makes it hard to eat there on a cold day. This is the only reason I am giving them 4 stars. They do have slightly limited parking so its best to get there before 12:00pm for lunch. They take phone orders and have super quick service. They even have a kids menu for those who aren't into the Mexican food, serving such items as French fries, burgers and chicken nuggets. I love Super Cuca's!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,This place is unreal. Super size diet burrito. Great name. Nothing diet about it. Bring your own beer. Outstanding salsa.  This is best super cucas location. Amazing as always. Always stop here when passing through Santa Barbara
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Awesome. Get the super taco with 2 extra flour tortillas. Fills you up for under $5. Make it you weekly Mexican fill up.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"What can I say about this place? This place rocks! Been coming to this place for years. I always get the Super Burrito, which is huge. The salsa rocks too!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Good salsas and great agua frescas. No lines, lots of seating, and decent bathroom."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Good fast food Mexican meals just what I needed for my Mexican food craving. Simple greasy and delicious
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Long lines all weekend, long lines all summer, dorm sized parking lot, reeks of raw of meat, very hot inside, limited seating outside, having to park across the street at Foodland for what?????? THE BEST FUCKING MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN....WORD!!!!! Huge burritos, much larger than chipotle......best part there is a burrito for everyone....their veggie burrito is to die for (yummy)!!! My favorite though would have to be the 3 taco plate with rice and extra guac....but you wont be eating these tacos with your hands but with a fork...Why?? The guys who prepares the food ,or at least the one i always saw, pretty much just throws 3 tortillas on the plate and puts a shit load of toppings on!!! ITS THE BOMB!! This place has great friendly staff who NEVER GOT MY ORDER WRONG and if they do .....always more than happy to fix it!!! Horchata is the bomb don't know if they make it their themselves or get it shipped in but what ever way it comes its Delicious !!! I was there usually 2 times a week mostly just Fridays and Saturdays i try not to eat junk during the week but if i did this my place of choice.....3 people can pretty much eat for under 25 bucks drinks included !! Oh and if you get to know the people there and come in often they will actually not charge you for extras (rice guac sour cream extra cheese)!! All i have to say is pay this place a visit when you are in town.........most locals will be more than happy to tell you where it is !!!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"My boyfriend and I stopped here for a quick bite on our way through town and i must say, we fell in LOVE with their super nachos! Sadly this place is far from home for us but we will definitely be stopping by again when we're near the area"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Went in on a Sunday around 11am. Wife got a breakfast burrito with bacon, I wanted regular carne asada. I ended up with a carne asada breakfast burrito, so bit of a communication break down. I thought it didn't have a enough salt or flavoring. Wife said she liked hers. Green salsa is best."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,great burritos and plates. Especially love the breakfast burrito. It is a classic SB Mexican plate and burrito food place. Parking not good during lunch hour. Also small market to pick us Carne Asada and some supplies for your own BBQ.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Thank you yelp! On our way from Santa Cruz to San Diego we wanted something not to far from the freeway, with fast and good food. I searched my trusted yelp app and found Super Cuca's.  I had the ""Diet burrito"" that contains cheese, avocado, beans, rice, and lettuce.  It was huge and although i am not sure that it was diet, I had no problem eating it. 5 stars are well deserved here.  My determination is always based on the salsa.  It is always what can make or break my mexican food.  And the green salsa does not disappoint (unless you are scared of a little heat!)  I know where we are stopping on the way back home!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"I love this location; it's kind of the hidden gem in a town already filled with excellent Mexican food.

I'm all about the burritos here. I'd go for the Super Burrito: packed with rice, cheese, beans, sour cream, onions, and cilantro. For less than $10 bucks, it's a steal (not to mention two meals! If you can finish the burrito in one sitting, color me impressed).

Grab the green sauce bottle, sit outside, and enjoy your food and gorgeous weather."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Been here a few times and it really is just okay. I know a lot of people hype it up about how great the food is but I'm really not that impressed. My husband grew up on Cuca's and so pretty much that's the only reason why I agree to come here but I would rather spend my money elsewhere. Not to mention that on our last visit we found hair in 2 out of our 5 dishes. They were happy to make us new food but I would have preferred my money back. Had the asada burrito and a kid's meal with carne asada, rice,  and beans. Rice is dry. Flavorless. Beans are like regular down home cooked pinto beans so that was fine. But the meat... no flavor. Had the shrimp taco which is actually more like shrimp fajitas with rice on corn tortillas. the veggies were good and fresh and they cut them up instead of precooked or frozen veggies. We also ordered the al pastor burrito which was $10, but it was huge and had a lot of meat in it. Hubby enjoyed it but then again he grew up on it and is a little easier to please than I am. Like I said not my choice to come here..."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Super Cuca's seems to appeal to the demographic that is 
1. drunk. 
2. poor. 
3. desirous of enormous portions.

I've eaten here once, at the request of a former resident of town during his college days. I guess our college days are past us, because I no longer fit into the above criteria and didn't find satisfaction in the food. My sensory experience does not recall any particular tastes, only the sight of an insanely large amount of food, and the unsettled fear in the parking lot that some kind of brawl was going to break out before we could move our car inconspicuously out of the way.

So if you are looking to invest your prime stomach real estate on layers of good flavor, I'm not recommending this place. But if you want to be full to the point of bursting, go for it!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"If you're into volume and not taste this is your place.  The beans were bland, the tortilla chips greasy, the cheese bland, the salsa fresca was totally uninspiring.  
Like 1 reviewer said, ""on the outside it just has it all...the smell, the locals, ..
I went for the food and got nothing except calories for my $."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Breakfast burritos all day? Yes please! Went with some friends to Santa Barbara for wine tasting and my friends raved about the huge super cucas burritos all the way there. I had a protein breakfast burrito with avocado and I have to say, it lived up to the hype. 4 stars because i got the carne asada and it was smaller pieces of meat, less steak like than I expected but still delicious."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Cucas may not be top notch Mexican food but that's not the point. If you want a lot of food for a fair price then this is definitely the spot. Burritos are big and they have a great variety of food to choose from. Looking for a great breakfast burrito, this is the spot. Can never go wrong. Now if you are looking for fine dine Mexican this is not the place, more of a grab and go."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"May not be my new favorite new burrito place, but I think it just might. Staff friendly & welcoming, service fast & accurate, and the portions are utterly generous. The food- fresh and flavorful. A soccer game is always on the tv facing the indoor/outdoor casual dining area where you'll find kids running amok in the best, true family-style way. Don't miss the roasted tomatillo heat on the side. Yum!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"Our family loves Super Cucas. Not only is the food good, but the customer service is incredible and prices are family friendly. This is one of our ""spots"" in SB. We eat here multiple times a month"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Great place for Mexican food.  It's not all caucasianified like El Bajio and as a result the prices are not sky-high.  Wonderful burritos.  Would definitely come back again.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"When I was going to college in SB, everyone was all about the Freebirds burritos. But anyone who anything about Mexican food knew that Cucas was the real burrito king.

Came by for lunch on a recent trip to SB and was surprised to find a new location. A few blocks away from DP, Cucas is now located where the old Korean joint Little Asia used to be. Sure the location is new, but the food is just as good. The breakfast burritos and the esteemed California burrito are the stuff of legends - many late drunken nights and early hungover mornings were graced with these fine species of burrito. Tried the shrimp burrito for the first time this trip and was impressed too!

The service, unfortunately, was mediocre. They ran out of horchata and pico de gallo when I was there, and the server was pretty slow. He was pretty young though, not like the older dudes who used to run the older location. I'm thinking it was an off day but, if not, then get it together, Cucas! Your Gauchos are counting on ya!"
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I recently had an opportunity to go to Santa Barbara for work and I read great reviews for Super Cuca's so i thought ""let me try it!"". I went there and ordered carne asada frieds which were about $11. Now $11 isnt bad for good food but i did not receive good food. I asked for no sour cream when i ordered and when i got the box, i opened it to check it and there was a giant serving of sour cream pretty much covering the entire order. I took it back to the window and the man literally just scooped the sour cream off and put some fries on top of the giant space that now has remnants of sour cream all over it, which i hate. On top of that, the fries were freezing cold. I was very disappointed."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,This is your typical hole in the wall restaurant with authentic Mexican food for cheap!  We ordered shrimp tacos and my plate was huge!  A must try!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,Been eating here for 15 years and it never gets old.  Try any of the 20 bfast burritos.  Super Burrito and Super Nachos do not disappoint.
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,I live right around the corner and it's the best Mexican food in town!!! I LOVE there nachos!!!!
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"Good nachos!
However, many of their dishes are very bland. Portions are quite large to help offset the cost of about $10 per meal. The daily specials are definitely the best deal and often the best flavor."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"My go-to hangover food. I'm not a big fan of their asada, but other than that their burritos are amazing. Rice and beans are always cooked just right, and the service is pretty quick."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,positive,"If you're hungry and want a delicious, authentic burrito the size of your HEAD then go here!

Everything is great about Super Cuca's. It would be improved if they had lenga among their meats. Or if they could do a fried fish burrito/taco instead of just shrimp to appease the seafood audience. I love Mexican restaurants that have a salsa buffet complete with the pickled carrots and onions and jalapenos. But those aren't here either. Thankfully their massive burritos make up for anything lacking. Yup, delicious spot."
BaWVwChTW_MqkKru_WZp3g,Super Cuca's Restaurant,Mexican,negative,"I had lunch a Super Cuca's today. There was a customer who decided to give is a loud and protracted political rant and would not stop.  After 10 minutes of a ruined lunch I asked the manager help us enjoy our lunch. Failure to intervene ruined my experience. I understand this is not ""fine dining"" place but a modicum of peace is expected."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"From a meat lover perspective, this is a great place to dine in. I went there to try the good karma burger (Tempeh burger) and it's delicious. I never know that vegetarian patty could be that tasty. It's so good that I come back again for my dinner to get another vegetarian burger (this time is a zen burger). It's made of grain and vegetables. Another good finding. Highly recommended.

Try their peanut butter shakes. You can't go wrong with that."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Man this place is a real classic, for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Im a carnivore myself so i always get the chicken tacos. I had a 40 dollar gift card and got to eat here four times. Its on state so bring your binoculars and a pocket full of change for the street musicians and homeless residents"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,My salad was ok and hubby said his pita was messy. I asked girl to wipe down the dirty table and she didn't. This place is not great.

Service en mode ""help yourself"", mais super carte, très sains, très bio, très Californien...

Les hamburgers et quesadillas sont excellents et copieux !!!! Heureusement, on peut demander des box pour emporter. 
On recommande aussi le guacamole !!!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Great Food if you are vegetarian.  This is my second time visit here. The food is a little bit expensive but this is santa barbara , every thing is pretty expensive. I miss their vege-hotdog which they have already taken out of their menu. Overall the restaurant is good whether you are vegetarian or meat lover."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Enjoyed the Chicken Caesar Salad. Nice, thick, juicy chunks of chicken and fresh lettuce. Dressing was tasty, too. There was a group of eight of us. Everyone was raving about how delicious there food was. And the accommodated us with no fuss by moving a few tables together. I knocked one star however because they don't have beef. It's not a vegan restaurant, so I'm not sure why they can't include some pasture raised beef on the menu. Still natural and healthy! They also have an outoor patio which would be nice for lunch or a warm night."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"A couple of friends took me to The Natural Cafe a week or so ago. I ordered the Portabella Mushroom Sandwich minus the garlic mayo (because well, mayo is gross, and also because I was with two attractive females and I thought I ought to stay away from garlic). It was really good, I enjoyed it. Came with a side of kind of terrible blue chips though, but that's mostly irrelevant. The friends I was with ordered the Chicken Tacos and split the plate. They seemed to like it. I would recommend this place, and there's a good chance I'll visit again."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"So have you ever had a taste of Amino Acids in a bottle? Chicken Burrito wrapped in Wheat Chapati topped with sour cream and guacamole? or What about a soy burger?

I didn't, until I came here.

While walking down State St. looking for somewhere to eat, I noticed a lot of people dressed down, chatting and enjoying the sun as they were feasting on this unique cuisine. I was hungry. As I walked in, all I could see was people all over the place. If there were this many people, it was a sign it had to be good, right?

As I said, I was hungry, so this was the next best thing. The people of the restaurant were very friendly, it must have been something in the food. I ordered a Chicken Burrito w/ a Wheat Chapati wrap.  That was interesting, as it was definitely a fusion-type food. Mexican and Indian? Only here in Santa Barbara. LOL

The flavor was good, and you could tell it was healthy, except for the sour cream, which was probably organic as well. The food looked as if would be a ""heavy"" stone in my stomach, but I was wrong. I was full, but not disgustingly full.

I didn't feel the food was bland. It was just healthier tasting, which wasn't bad at all.

I enjoyed the food and the company very much.

I just wish there was one up here in Northern California. hint. hint."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"First visit - I came here today because I was CRAVING a healthy soup. The two choices were chicken noodle (boring!) and Moroccan Vegetable, which sounded great! Ordered a bowl of that and a Caesar Salad with grilled chicken. Paid, and sat down patiently, knowing that an amazing bowl of soup was on its way! 

Unfortunately, I was wrong. My salad arrived with a bowl of 'apology'... Sorry, they already changed the soup... Before she could even finish explaining, someone else arrived cheerfully with a bowl of Split Pea soup - quite possibly my LEAST favorite soup on the planet. It's what the poor kids often had when I was growing up, and I was no stranger to it. Kind of like the Little Rascals episode with mush. Enough said. 

So souplessly, I explored my salad. It was good - VERY GOOD! People were nice, place was clean, food I received was good, but there are some disappointments that cannot be recovered from to the tune of five stars, but a SOLID FOUR. I will return, hopefully to explore my Melville's soup. ;)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Cute place. Right next to a freshly squeezed juiced place as well. First thing that was new to me at a restaurant, a sign that said: take a menu and order in the front. And it's self-seated.

There's 2 water stations with lemon and ice bucket to serve yourself. The interior decoration: ""natural"" aka few paintings of nature, homey-feel with a beachy color (tan/brown/sandy color).

I had:
-Mangia marinara pizza + it came with a small salad: pizza tasted great. I had it without onions. 
-Veggie lasagna + it came with a small salad. Wasn't too fond of the veggie lasagna.
-The side salad that came with the food tasted flavorful: tiny tomatoes, kikama, etc.
-Cornbread muffin w/ honey butter = good enough for two people 

Wish they had more bathrooms, only two stalls. There's a great variety of bottled drinks: marinellis apple juice, organize green teas, organic OJ, etc."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"We were visiting Santa Barbara for the day and saw this restaurant rated in a magazine as one of the best lunches in Santa Barbara. We ordered the chicken burrito and the veggie lasagna.  They were alright, nothing great.  About a 3 star meal.  My friend was excited to go there because he likes vegan and/or really fresh healthy tasting food.  This is not a vegan or vegetarian restaurant (which is A-OK with me).  

With a name like Natural Café, I think we are all assuming the restaurant has a special angle...but it does not seem to be anything special at all.   The décor was kind of cafeteria like:  lots of dusty fake green plants dotted throughout.  Eww. I hate that.  The place just didn't feel well thought out and memorable.  Pretty much a forgettable experience.  They say Santa Barbara has 400 restaurants - my advice is to pick another."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Casual delicious vegetarian food.  Very large menu.  Has a nice outdoor patio on State street.  Great people watching.  I would eat here everyday if I lived in Santa Barbara.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Let's be real, the Nat Caf is great, but it's not that great. There are plenty of other restaurants that will give you much more heart and soul than Nat Caf. This place is really for old people that have problems with their digestion so they need boring food with a sprinkle of cheese. 

I've had the chicken stir fry and the fish tacos and both times I walked away feeling very full, but knowing that they were multiple other places that would have been better. It's a fine meal, but if you're looking for something that will make you happy with intense flavor and creativity instead of just a full belly than this is not my jam."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"It was good but not as good as I expected. 
The staff was ok.
We had quesadillas and burritos.
I like the atmosphere there and the terrace is pretty cool."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"In the fair city of SB, this place is pretty great. They make healthy and delicious foods and it won't break your bank! Who'd a thunk?? The inside is nice and stuff too. Outdoor seating is perfect for people watching though. The protocol is order and pay at the register, then your food is brought to your table."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Her salad was good, but nothing special my wife said.  I had the pasta special and it was rather bland -- shredded cheese straight from a pack, creamy sauce.  Living with a vegetarian, there are a lot of ways to ""make it up"" (fresh garlic, fresh herbs, grated cheese, pepper flakes, etc.) -- none of those ""tricks"" made it in my special.
It might be more a lunch place than dinner -- the ambiance was more cafeteria than dining.  We'll may go back, but for lunch.
As a vegetarian, my wife would rate one star above my 2 because there are a lot choices."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Awesome healthy place on State Street, central Santa Barbara.

My husband and I were doing the PCH, about 1.5 weeks in to a 2 week trip, and were in need of a healthy meal. The Natural Cafe was excellent. The food is stuff you can likely make at home, but having someone make you a straight-up healthy, no fuss meal is actually kind of a rarity. My husband got a vegetable stir fry with rice - portion was quite big, but love of varied veggies and great sauce. I had a sandwich/salad combo (avocado sandwich) which again, I likely could've made at home, but was good nonetheless. 

Don't except gourmet decor or complete waiter service. You order at the cash, and pick up cutlery and condiments at your leisure. 
But DO go here for simple, healthy and nourishing food."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,The food is great and employees are friendly. But the best thing you could possibly get there is the Lemon Bars and apparently they are no longer making them... *sigh* won't be coming back as often now
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Great tasting healthy food at a decent price. Tons of vegetarian options. Had the veggie stir fry with sauteed tofu over brown rice while the bf had the portobello mushroom sandwich. Stir fry was good, lacking a little flavor but nothing a little soy sauce couldn't fix. Stole a bite of the portobello sandwich (with pesto, cheese and sprouts) -- amazing!!! Restaurant is big, bright and airy. Patio seating for dogs and humans. Definitely recommend this place!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Found this place on Yelp when we wanted something healthy for lunch. It is like Panera in that you go and order your food, they give you a number and they bring your food to your table. Hearty portions, fresh ingredients and friendly service. Can't go wrong with a lunch at Natural Cafe."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The Natural Cafe is probably one of my favorite places to go in Santa Barbara for a quick bite to eat. I work on the next block up so it's super convenient for me to call ahead before my lunch break so I can run in and pick up my food. The pricing is not too bad, even if it's a tad more than I would like to pay, but the taste is so good I forget about it. I highly recommend the natural marinara or the albacore tuna sandwich!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Terrible food ever!!!! Don't eat the TOFU !!! Taste kind expire, old !!!!! 
Terrible costumer service!!!!!
Terrible Management !!!!!!!!! 
Terrible cooking !!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Nothing here is Natural !!!!!!!!
NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN !!!!!
Good luck for this Horrible restaurant !!!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,So fresh. And so tasty! Loved the options! Salad was amazing. And so we're the grilled veggies. They have a serve-yourself water bar. Which is perfect for when you are waiting for your food. Loved this place.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"One of the highlights in our trip to Santa Barbara. Seriously, great entrees for the omnivore and carnivore. At the same time, great variety for the vegetarian and that weren't bland or had that wheatgrass/granola vibe.
My gf had the Local Favorite and I had the chicken pita. She loved it; had avocado and she found it refreshing to have it served on 9-grain bread, an upgrade from standard whole wheat. The chicken pita was very tasty, wasn't doused with dijon mustard but didn't taste dry. 
Great place to people watch or come here for brunch, lunch, or plan your day in State Street. We'll come back and definitely wanna try the pasta/lasagna. This place reminds me of a ""healthy"" Cheesecake factory, without the stuffiness and just good food for a budget. Kid friendly, good seating, and anything from juice to booze for drinks. A tasty lunch for two under 15 bucks, it's rare to get that in CA these days!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I've been going to Natural Cafe for years and it's always delicious. It's one of the only healthy, easy and fairly inexpensive places to eat in Santa Barbara, which makes it a hot spot for locals. All locations are consistently good, so don't worry about which restaurant you end up going to. 

My personal favorites are The Albacore (which is a tuna sandwich), The Gobbler Burger (a turkey burger), and the chicken cesar salad. Oh, and their new corn bread recipe is quite tasty. 

There's a fair balance between veggie and meat entrees. The menu is fairly large too. Check this place out if you need a great healthy, but hearty meal."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Looked up ""healthy food"" while on the 101 and this came up! The reviews do not lie because the food is soo good! Well, at least what I tried.

I ordered the old fashioned salad with lemon herb dressing (so good) and I was not disappointed at all. The servings are huge so I just ate half there and the other half for dinner! 

We didn't know where to park but found a lot on the opposite side of the restaurant. Free for the first 90 mins I believe?

Anyways, we sat in the outside patio and it was really nice to just people watch while eating. The inside was also very spacious and clean. The people are friendly and I really wish there was one in my area!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Not a bad place overall. The food is ok. I dont think it is great. Teh ingredients seem fresh but the preparation of the dishes overall is basic. 

The place itself is basic. I think they could adjust a little bit the decor and try to elevate teh menu a little bit because there is the potential to be better. But,right now, i do not think it deserves more than 3 stars."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Great food, and healthy too! I work in Goleta and usually go to the Natty Cafe off Hollister. We were shopping on State and decided to go to the one downtown. We arrived around 1 o clock ( thought we would be the rush crowd) and wow was it crowded! We were very lucky to find a table for they were all taken. The menus is big with lots of choices. I got the chicken stir fry and the wife got the veggie burger. The chicken stir tasted a little greasy but overall very fresh and flavorful, no needed additives! The burger looked very good and camp with blue tortilla chips. Make sure you ask them for their homemade salsa, its the best! Over all we love this place and will be back they get 4 stars for the long wait for both ordering and getting your food. Love this place though! If you haven't been here you need to come, or not so you can keep the line smaller for us regulars ;)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Hm, I dunno. I came here once and I'm all for the organic/vegetarian/vegan/fresh ingredients thing, although I am not one, but the food seems, a little flavorless. And I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that it's natural and vegetarian, because Sojourner pulls that off brilliantly. But I always find that my food is just a bit bland. Maybe they should take a little tip from Sojourner on how to combine organic and vegetarian and fresh ingredients."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Try the grilled cheese. Great place to go after shopping on State St for healthier fare.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Food was great, good choices, ordered yogi special, veggie stir fry, kids also enjoyed their choices. great service. nice atmosphere."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Very average mixed green salad. I added chicken, also unremarkable. Menu was diverse though, so I might go back and try something else."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Healthy but hardy, great portion sizes, and a versatile menu. The restaurant doesn't have the most amount of decor, ambiance, service..... but it's solid food, consistent, something for everyone. A go- to for easy, healthy food in downtown Santa Barbara."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Not being a Santa Barbara resident, I constantly crave their Zog Dog (veggie dog covered in veggie chili that has corn kernels and sliced carrots) and delicious and not-too-sweet peanut butter milkshake from afar."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Natural cafe is a great place to grab a meal with friends family, and even potentially a simple date. The food is good and while there is a casual vibe, the employees are very polite and helpful. It's a fun atmosphere and a great place to eat if you're looking for something local, fresh, and not to fancy."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"What a great healthy, and natural place! There are so many options. Salads, sandwiches, burgers, entrees, juices. 

Also, some REALLY great pricing for Santa Barbara. 

First time around I ordered the Salmon Pesto Entree. Keep in mind, it's A LOT of food. Haha! They do not short change you here by any means. 

The Salmon Pesto a nice portion of salmon and also brown rice. The Pesto is delicious. It is pretty feeling, so don't plan to workout afterwards. 

Next time around, Mt. Fuji Stir Fry for all the chicken and vegetable lovers. Amazing portion size, yummy ginger soy dressing for the vegetables - they don't drain the veggies, also some yummy chicken. Not dry. 

The FISH TACOS - they are probably a 3 out of 5. They didn't have much flavor but they're still good. 

Chicken quesadilla- super delicious. Comes with wheat wrap and guacamole. Yum. Extremely tasty. 

If you're in SB, this is a must."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,This place is my favorite healthy eating in SB. Great food and a very cute staff. I eat here 4-6 times a week.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Lovely place to grab healthy food.  Very accommodating of substitutions.  They also have a good drink selection.  Had the mushroom burger and swapped turkey for salmon in a lettuce wrap instead of a bun... Very satisfying, flavorful and healthy.  A tad expensive but that's what you get for eating on state street."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Basically my favorite restaurant ever. PERIOD.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Not so ""natural cafe""

I have one comment really -- they're called the ""natural cafe"" yet they use the eco-unfriendly products such as styrofoam for their coffee and food.  

Huge turn off.  

Even four-bucks is eco-friendly.  I just felt kinda deceived by the marketing of the name and thought I'd rant here.  Tis all."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"A Vitamin Water and a veggie burger that I don't have to shop for and assemble myself? I must have been dreaming. 

As if Santa Barbara needed anything more to make it cooler than it already is, The Natural Cafe is absolutely wonderful. The proprietors self-describe themselves as committed to health and environmental wellness, noting ""this is a small planet and we must preserve its resources. We recycle our glass, cans and paper and encourage our guests to do the same. By eating an all natural diet and excluding red meat we can help promote a greener planet.""

The Natural Cafe talks the talk and, more importantly, walks the walk. The food was wonderful, the atmosphere as zen-like and peaceful as could be and the people (patrons and employees) were really, really nice. Made me want to come home to San Diego and open one up here.

Every city needs one of these."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,I must admit that I found the Chicken-Stuffed Spud to be incredibly tasty. Definitely worth a try if ever you visit the place in the future.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The Natural Cafe is a Santa Barbara staple. Everything is fresh and delicious. I especially love their Tahini dressing on pretty much about anything. Yes, you have to stand in line to place your order, but a server brings it to your table. Ive never been bothered with standing in line, which is a complain I hear from some of my friends. Its casual, quick, and convenient.... not to mention DELICIOUS. I've going there for 15 years... or more.... however long they've been open.They have friendly staff, delicious, HEALTHY food for very reasonable prices. WIN WIN WIN!!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Finally we encountered a restaurant with a wide variety of vegetarian choices. The food was good and reasonably priced. Also great smoothies!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Walked out of this place and convinced 4 perplexed folk that this was the spot... And high fives ... As if everyone knew each other... And before I know it ... The food ... Walked away .... happily
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I've been vegetarian for 20 years, and I've eaten at hundreds of places like this one: a Denny's quality place for healthy eaters. For healthy eaters: whole grain options, vegetables, tempeh, tofu, etc. ""Denny's quality"" because everything's a little bland and not especially special. My veggie quesadilla was helped more by my adding tahini dressing than it was by the guacamole, sour cream, or salsa that came with it.

There's a place in the culinary world for order-at-the-counter cafes like this, just as there's a place for diners and take out food. Perfectly serviceable."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Tons of veggie options, which was nice.  The yogi (tofu) was fairly tasteless, however. It worked well for the kids as they don't like a lot of spice, but I think I would stick to non-Asian dishes here.  The mushroom barley soup was excellent, as was the veggie lasagna."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"De la cuisine Californienne, une grande première pour moi.

J'ai adoré ce restaurant, aux allures de fastfood old School. Bien sur on y retrouve une forte influence mexicaine, dans tous les cas c'est un vrai régale, frais et diététique on a pas l'impression de ce gaver. Le petit milkshake tout frais qui vas bien est parfait. 
Un bon restaurant pour y déjeuner."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Natural Cafe is SO AWESOME. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants! Always a must whenever I'm lucky enough to find myself in SB....
For starters, it's in a great location on State Street. Very relaxed, casual place, with lots of natural light, big windows, plenty of tables and booths (try to snag a spot on the patio! great people-watching), and cool artwork to look at while you wait for your food. Ohhhhhh the food. The menu is so impressive! Everything is healthy and fresh. 
My faves = the gobbler burger (SO GOOD. and yeah this place is not vegetarian! It does have excellent vegetarian options, yes, but they offer more than enough fabulous choices for us carnivores...) and the old town salad with grilled chicken (SO SO SO GOOD). I have tried almost everything on the menu and would have to say that I was least impressed with the Baja Burrito. Still awesome, yes, but not amazing like the gobbler burger.
The smoothies are also delicious. As are the chocolate chip cookies.
I seriously dream about the Natural Cafe when I'm in Seattle. Great spot!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Needed to find a place for lunch on the way back from a long drive across Highway 101.  Utilizing the conveniences of our smart phone, we searched for a vegeterian-type establishment in Santa Barabara on Yelp!  We found this place to be the most alluring based on the reviews but were turned off after reading the review from ""Juliet"".  Nonetheless all the other Yelpers! were raving so we gave it a shot..

We were thoroughly pleased with not only the food, but with the service and atmosphere.  Contrary to the aforementioned review, the restroms were in pristine condition (no tokens needed) and the decor was very modern and original (no sign of the 70's to be found).  Of course we weren't here because of the interior design.  The imitation chicken dish was a treat and enjoyed the fresh vegetables in the salad.  Well done Natural Cafe!

Definitely a top choice on my list for for veggie dining destinations along the Central Coast."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This place is amazing and affordable!
I got the veggie enchiladas and literally, they were the absolute best enchiladas Ive ever had in my life. The veggies are so fresh and luscious and they aren't stingy with their portions.
It came out pretty fast and the service is good.
I've only been here once, but Im moving to SB for school and applied there for a job. The atmosphere is really friendly and open."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"After reading the other reviews, I decided to give this place a try in spite of being rather financially poor at the moment.  Turned out to be a pretty bad idea.  

First of all, the service was lackluster at BEST.  I had to wait to place my order while some college-aged girl chatted with someone WITH HER BACK TO ME.  You have the simplest job in the world, to stand there and just be friendly to people while ringing them up, and yet that seemed to be too much for her.  REALLY off-putting.  Then the girl who brought my food to the table was less than friendly, as well.  I know it's Santa Barbara, so I've basically decided to chalk it up to EVERYONE here being an unfriendly asswipe, but all the same, if it's YOUR JOB to provide service, fucking DO IT!

Second, the food.  The food was okay, but after reading numerous reviews of people talking about ""HUGE PORTIONS,"" I am left with genuine concern for the population of SB.  I received a plate with 10 tortila chips (countable), two small slices of bread, one slice of tomato, one leaf of lettuce, a couple sprouts, and one mushroom.  For $7.50.  WAY overpriced.  And if THAT is what people consider to be huge portions, for goodness sake, PLEASE seek help with your anorexia.

All in all, I would NEVER return here.  I just felt generally uncomfortable with all the unfriendly people there, felt gyped on my meal, and see no reason anyone bothers to spend a fucking penny here.  You can make a much better meal on your own in a matter of minutes for half the price and eat in a better atmopshere.  Why bother?  If I'm going to pay someone for a dining experience, fast serve or not, I expect a lot more.  SB people are apparently way too sheltered in their bubble of wealth to even know what good food and service are about, ironically enough."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Take a break from the wine and incredible restaurant for the Natural. Don't think ""healthy"" food can't be satisfying. Great protein smithies, and the flavors here (some Asian, some Latin) are amazing. Huge portions. Perfect for lunch. Chicken is a must here, on whatever dish."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"We couldn't decide between this place and Sushi. I was for The Natural Cafe and so we turned to what we thought was a very mature way of solving any problem really, we played rock, paper, scissors.

I won! I had the Michelle My Belle all natural smoothie. I enjoyed that peach, pineapple, pineapple-coconut juice concoction till the last drop. With my smoothie, I had The Natural Burger, a nicely seasoned soy patty topped with fresh veggies. As much as I was enjoying my food everyone else was loving theirs as well. All four of us walked away very satisfied and I sometimes wonder how life would be now if it wasn't for ROCK PAPER SCISSORS.

Victory never tasted so good."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"This place is ok.  Not amazing but ok if I can't find much else.  Salad was good, tahini dressing was really good and the soup special was good.   Nothing to scream about and nothing to complain about.  Prices were good and selection was decent."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I had the Buddha Burrito and Peach Michelle Belle smoothie (I think that's the name of the smoothie), and it was a very satisfying vegetarian dinner for me. I could not even finish the burrito, ate only half and then the waitress took notice and asked if I wanted to wrap it. Not only great food, but great service, AND even saw a woman dusting off the Buddha by the door."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"My dog and date found a table outside, while I went in to order and grab some drinks. I ordered the Cobb salad with half an avocado, chicken, sprouts, veggie baco bits, and tomato with lemon herb dressing. Very crispy and refreshing lunch! My date ordered the tostada salad with chicken ranchero (marinated chicken in spicy sauce). The salad was packed with brown rice, black beans, guacamole, sour cream and all the veggies - equipped with a whole wheat tortilla underneath. I love that the salads came in wooden bowls, reminded me of my mom, she has the same bowls - so cool. We sat outside on a super windy day, but we had the pup so it wasn't that bad."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"casual, inexpensive & veggie-friendly spot for lunch on State St.  the menu is extensive, so you are sure to find something for everyone.  definitely not fancy or special, but it gets the job done.  I do recommend the sauteeed tofu & their 9 grain bread is yummy. vegetarian & vegan options are clearly marked on their menu"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I stopped there on my way to San Francisco. I had the Old Town salad, half portion. It tasted good, but there was too much feta cheese. My friend had the Good Karma burger, which was awesome! Seriously, I took a bite and wished I had ordered the same.
This is a good place for vegetarians, and close to the freeway if you want to have a break on the road."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Hands down great tasting salad with variety to satisfy your tastebuds. Prices are very competitive as well.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,I adore The Natural Cafe.  They should seriously open up another one closer to LA because they would do so well.  They have really good vegetarian food that is healthy but ohh so tasty at the same time.  They also have chicken dishes that I haven't tried.  My friend and I shared the zog dog and veggie lasagna.  It was sooo satisfying and wholesome.  We really enjoyed our meals and decided to come again during our short getaway to Santa Barbara.  Yes we were back the following day for lunch.    I love their food!!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Love this place on State St:  grab the Natural Tamale, and a seat outside under an umbrella and enjoy the people walking by on a nice day.  One of the few places you can get a veg tamale that isn't cheese."

So anyways, this place is a total good place to hit especially for vegetarians.  I got the tofu stirfry.  YES.  It was good and tasty with the brown rice.  This is what I've been craving since we started the tour from San Francisco.  I also got a fruit smoothie.  YUM!!!!!
PS: The mac and cheese looks SO GOOD."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"The salsa for the blue corn chips tasted like ""pizza"" sauce. I could find a dressing I could enjoy with my salad, they all seemed to be similar. I would not go back to this cafe."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,Went in with a hundred dollar bill and they wouldnt let me get anything.. Terrible service I was starving while watching my friends eat absolutely pathetic and ridicilous
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I was impressed with the healthy food approach! I got the best cobb salad in my life here, and my sister got a simple grilled cheese which she said was very good."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Great food! Friendly people. Santa Barbara is full if health food places but Natty Caf is one of the best
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"My husband and I strolled in here on Monday night at around 8:40 pm (they close at 9:00) to try out the dinner options. We were stuffed from our lunch at C'est Cheese so we wanted to eat something healthy and light. I ended up ordering the tofu and veggies and my husband got the tempeh tacos. It took about 10-15 minutes for our food to come out. The veggies and tofu with the brown rice were OK. I wasn't overly thrilled with the flavor profile but it did the trick. The vegetables that were included were basically zucchini, squash and carrots. I would have appreciated a bit more variety. My husband thought that the tempeh tacos were pretty good, but it could have had a bit more spice in it. The service was great and the place was clean. I would want to try a few other options to see if I would enjoy one of those since this place does have quite a few vegetarian options. Check it out if you want something on the healthier end."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I love this place! It's great for lunch or dinner. The food is fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend the chicken enchiladas or ranch salad, but you'll be happy with anything you choose from their menu. I'll definitely be back!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Their Butternut squash soup was so delicious!  Since it was a soup of the day, I don't think it's served all the time but it's definitely worth trying.  For my meal, I had the veggie stir fry with tofu and brown rice but the vegetable pieces were so big and bland that I was not too impressed.  You can bring your own wine and they provide glasses without a corkage fee."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"A Vegan Paradise. Vegetarian galore. 

Good food and great service. There's always something different about vegetarian oriented restaurants besides the food. The atmosphere is always brighter. The restaurant isn't anything fancy but when you have a room full of herbivores, the people serve as the atmosphere. Health-concious, eco-concious, or life-concious, they all seem to reflect the same ambiance. 

The menu is quite a variety, ranging from falafels to eggplant. You can't really go wrong. As for the price, there's no such thing as eating healthy for cheap. So expect to spend some dough but think of it as an investment in your health. Although their portions are a bit larger than a health-oriented individual might be used to, this is definitely a good place to finally start that new year's resolution for any newcomers."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Love this place. Can we get one in San Diego please? I like the Fuji Stir Fry. Get it every time.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"If you want to eat healthy and you want it taste good, go here!  Always friendly staff too!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Our group of 7 went here for a quick lunch and had a great time. Each of us got separate orders to go, really simple to order, and we all got our meals within 15 minutes. Really delicious vegetarian and vegan options, a little pricey, but you're paying for delicious food. I would definitely go again if I was in the area!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Yum! This was a great find in Santa Barbara, and everything was delicious and fresh.

The site next door is currently under construction and they have a small juice bar set up. On Sat evening they were offering juice tasting to passerby's. The cafe has an outdoor seating area for those who love to enjoy the CA weather. 

You grab a menu when you enter and go into the restaurant to the back to order. The lady at the counter had not tried much of the menu so she was unable to suggest between two options. They give you a number and bring out your food about 5-10 minutes later. It was yummy and in sufficient quantity!

I recommend checking this place out if you're around Santa Barbara and enjoy freshly made food."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Exceeded my expectations. This joint has a very easy to read menu with obviously health oriented options. I would shy away from the soups, but other options on the menu are definitely acceptable. Although there is nothing unique about the menu, if your looking for a great spot for a quick lunch or dinner with affordable pricing (for state street), check this place out."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Delicious food and lunch saturation of all the senses,

Good stuff there , I really happy to eat in this place."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"My best friend and I come here for our go-to lunches. I love the Old Town salad with grilled chicken and tahini poppyseed dressing. Or the gobbler burger with grilled onions.

The chips and salsa are also amazing
And the chocolate milk shakes.

I never go wrong with anything I order here."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Great place & very fresh veggies. Many great choices that it's hard to decide what to order. Last time I was there, I ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich and the eggplant was so plump & fresh--not greasy or soggy like eggplant dishes often arrive. 
 
The smoothies are also delish...

Another plus: the prices are great compared to many other ""natural"" food cuisines I've visited. Can't wait to return!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Had the old town salad. Not bad. Tastes very healthy, but nothing to write home about."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The food was pretty good, but they have limited gluten free options, and as a gluten free vegan this was a major negative.  Almost every health food place I have been to has gluten free bread and is very gluten conscious.  My boyfriend liked his food and so did I but it was a little bland.  I would go back but it is not my first choice, there are definitely better vegan/veggie places out there."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Had a wonderful dinner here and came back a couple days later to eat lunch at their other location! I loved the black bean enchiladas and the pasta primavera was so delicious. I love how all of their meals are included with a side salad, so the meal is a perfect balance of everything. The ambience was very chill and open, like you could bring anyone here for any meal. It was truly a vegetarian heaven. I'm definitely planning to come back next time I'm in Santa Barbara!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Ah-mazing. I loved the Vegetarian Veggie Enchiladas so much I went back the next day and ordered them again. Delicious and fresh ingredients. A must try if you are in downtown Santa Barbara!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The wifey had a Chicken pita.  I went with a Falafel pita. We split a salad and shared a  Pecan choco chip cookie.

Allin all I enjoyed my experience. It took a little longer than expected for the food to come out, and I think I enjoyed my falafel pita more than my wife enjoyed her chicken pita.

This place is all healthy organic style foods, which is right up the wifey's alley. We'll stop by again next time we're in Santa Barbara"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I SO wanted to like this place. My husband's fish tacos were fishy and had nothing special on them. I had an eggplant sandwich that wasn't really impressive.

I'm all for natural foods, I just needed some better flavors.

Wish I had a better experience in my few hours in Santa Barbara.  

People here were friendly though! It may have just been what I ordered."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I ate at the natural café in Simi VAlley this afternoon.  As I came to the bottom of my rice bowl I found a paper fortune from a fortune cookie....from panda express next door!  I was disgusted!! I just got over being v sick w/stomach flu the entire holiday season!  I showed this to the manager who said ""Oh I'm so sorry, would you like us to remake your plate? I replied 'NO'. I was nauseated at this point.  Then she offered me a free dessert.  I declined and explained that I had just over a terrible stomach illness and I hope I don't get sick again! She said ""oh I hope not"".  Are u kidding?!! No offer to even reimburse my meal!! NO promise to chuck the rice pot in the kitchen. I'm not eating here anymore!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Came back again this Labor Day weekend because we really loved our first visit a couple of years ago, but unfortunately the food isn't as great compared to before. My usual roasted turkey sandwich was a major fail. It got smaller with the additional $1.30 price increase and barely has any turkey in it, plus an extra $1.79 for two puny cubes of avocado and another $1.09 for some sprinkled Monterrey Jack cheese - not sliced but specks of cheese which I can barely see and taste! They smeared too much mayo and put regular mustard instead of dijon mustard. The bread was too sweet. The only thing that made it looked 'fuller' was the folded lettuce and tomato. In the end, my sandwich has ballooned up to over $13! Oh how I wished there was a Mendocino Farms nearby!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Great food at great prices. Based on yelp reviews we decided to grab a quick lunch here and are happy we did. I would highly recommend to anyone! I wish we had one in LA. I would be a regular!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I'm giving this a 5 star because the Natural Cafe exceeded my expectations in terms of both customer service and the quality of food. Me and 5 other girls were in the middle of an extremely hectic day on the day of our friends' wedding. 

In the midst of all the wedding preparations and running around, we had to have a decent meal. So, I ordered ahead--6 different sandwiches. Upon arrival, we were extremely pleased that they had our orders accurately ready to go. She was even nice enough to ring them up as separate checks, which made this whole ordeal much easier for us. A lot of people might have given us attitude about the difficulty of 6 different orders, but she did it with a smile!

I ordered the portabello mushroom and it was rich, filling and extremely satisfying. My friends raved about the Cobb salad. 

We didn't stay to eat, but the environment was friendly and casual. 

I highly recommend The Natural Cafe!! As good as it gets :)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Awesome food and excellent prices. A new stop for my SB visit.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,We had the Tortilla soup with fresh baked rye. It was the best tortilla soup I've ever had! We definitely recommend it!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This place works. Its on state street so it is a great location. The food is good and fairly priced. The service was fast. The best things about my experience here was the ability to people watch. We came here on a saturday afternoon when state st was pretty busy. Its fun to watch everyone walking by, shopping, talking, etc. I would come back for the atmosphere alone."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,I got an old town salad with grilled chicken and tahini. It was honestly delicious! I've been eating terribly on vacation and it was nice to have a healthy yet delicious meal. Service was really good and everything came out quickly.  You order at the counter and then the servers bring the food out to you. Prices are a little above average it was about 15 dollars for a salad. But it was worth it. Def recommend.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"One word:  Delicious!  The food is fresh, the flavors are savory, and the service is good.  The dishes are on the healthy side, and the portions are just right.  Very satisfying place to have a meal.  I had one of the best chicken enchiladas ever!  I'm trying to eat healthier, and this place makes that easy to do.  Great place to take your family, friends, or date.  The food is that good!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"we had an awesome lunch here during our santa barbara adventure. picking out beers to pair with our meal was especially fun, they had a great selection! my favorite part of this restaurant experience was being able to sit outside and enjoy the sunny, breezy late may weather. it was glorious."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I used to come here all the time when I still lived in santa barbara. One of my favorite restaurants ever, hands down."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I had the natural burger and it was soo good! Would have liked it more if it came with a side of fries, but the chips and salsa were great too. I'm definitely going back to try their other burgers and smoothies. When we went it wasn't busy at all and the service was good."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Loved the tamale, and really appreciate all the vegan options. That said, I think the miso dill dressing on my side salad was my favorite part. Good family atmosphere, and I also got to try a new somewhat local beer. They let us customize a vegan pizza for the kids, which they loved. Will definitely go again."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I absoluely LOVE natural cafe!  It is clean, quick and inexpensive.  The gobler burger is one of my favorite things from any restaurant.  It always feels good to eat somewhere with REAL ingredients.  Nice outdoor seating too!  I love this place!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"It is good. I love this place. I haven't tried the locations in Westlake Village or the one in Moorpark, both considerably closer to LA than Santa Barbara, but well worth the drive.

The Zog Dog, the turkey sandwich, the grilled chicken in the pita, or the local favorite, all are good choices. An excellent vegetarian restaurant

It is tough for me to recommend anything, but this one I do."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"when returning to SB, this is always my first stop!!! 
Love everything on the menu but usually get the hummus plate and the caesar salad w chicken - our favorite to share :-)

fantastic location and the freshest ingredients make this my #1 favorite in SB."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Very good place to get a veggie burger.  Not as good as The Sojourner. Dunno if that place is still around, but it was even better.  However, at the Natural Cafe, you can shop the store next door while you wait for a table.  Cafeteria style ordering.  (sojourner is fancier.)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Zog Dog is da-bomb!  No ground pigs feet and chicken beak in this dog!  Add an order of stir fried veggies and you'll be set!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I went for lunch with the girlfriend as she had her heart set on dining outside. 

I've never been to Santa Barbara before so I was happy to soak in some local charm and people-watch as I ate my vegan meal.

I ordered the black bean burritos and asked for no cheese or sour cream. The cashier was an extremely nice gentleman who asked me to be certain: ""so it'll be vegan?"" To which I replied ""yes, please.""

The girlfriend had ""The Local Favorite"": avocado, lettuce, tomato, red onion, sprouts, and garlic mayo on nine-grain bread. We also had a large veggie juice consisting of carrots, beets, and celery. 

Our food was served very quickly which was great. The Local Favorite was pleasing to her but she let me have the entire veggie juice as she discovered the taste of beets aren't really her thing.

My plate looked amazing; two burritos with a lush green salad on side. The only problem was that when I took a bite of the burrito, it was loaded with chicken. Luckily for them, I'm what they call a ""flexitarian"" so I wasn't gonna fly off the handle like some ass-monkey who acts as though he's been served a plate of fresh baby instead of a chicken burrito.

Still, when the guy who takes your order confirms you want a vegan entree and then they bring you a chicken burrito, it's the sort of the thing most people care about. The chicken was pretty delicious though ha ha.

It's a great place and I highly recommend it but I couldn't quite give it five stars."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I have had  a meal here  about once a week for almost 14 years.  I love it. The food is always great and the staff is friendly.  The gobbler burger is so good I cannot believe it's not beef. The old town salad and the salmon specials are winners.  I bring out of town guests and work associates here and they always like it.  It's healthy option at a reasonable price.  No, it's not all organic or all perfect but it's good food at a good price."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Reasonable prices, delicious food that is also healthy, right on lower State.  I've been a happy Natural Cafe customer for over a decade.  One of the nicest meals for the money in Santa Barbara.  This location is a bit more ""trendy"" and loud than the Hitchcock and Goleta locations, but the people are nice and the food is delicious."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This was the perfect stop for a lighter lunch. You can taste how fresh the food is! There were 5 of us, and we were all super happy! The portobello ""burger"" was my favorite. The hummus was great, too (though, I don't know how anyone can screw up hummus).

I will definitely eat here again the next time I'm in the area. 

My only complaint is that the staff was a little rude, as we were visiting from out of town and the dining style is really modern, we just didn't understand and they had a little bit of an attitude."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This place is great.  I was looking for a vegetarian spot for my friend and this place have us some quality food for both meat eaters and vegetarians.

I had the zen burger that's all veggie, it was good but the highlight of my trip were the lemon herb salad dressing coupled with the salad and the pineapple coconut soy shake!  Amazing stuff."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Know what you're getting into before you eat here.  The food is pretty good if you're a vegetarian or vegan.  Even if you're not, you'll enjoy their sandwich and shake offerings.  This location is clean, convenient, and the service is pretty good.  Not to mention you don't feel guilty after eating all of the yummy food (that is... if you can resist their shakes).  I'll definitely be back."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Portobello sandwich with avacado is a MUST! Teriyaki chicken sandwich is also good but portobello is way better in my opinion. Very friendly and attentive waitstaff, they even helped us brainstorm bars to spend NYE in (thanks guys!)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"This is a really low-rent ""good for you"" restaurant. Maybe I've been spoiled by LA's great vegan/vegetarian options, but this place is basically a Chili's masquerading as a health food place. Been here twice and everything was extremely mediocre. A ten dollar salad should be more than romaine, shredded carrots, a tiny dollop of guacamole and uncooked rice. Bleh."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,My go to lunch spot. Consistently good and very reasonably priced. 1/2 salad is the way to go as they are fairly ample.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,i'm not healthy..but i like their stuff. good for healthy people and non-healthy peeps like me.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Natural Cafe's strength is in the quality and freshness of their ingredients. The food tastes clean and even after a burger you won't leave feeling bloated. If it's sunny outside, get a seat on the patio and enjoy your food along with the charm of lower State street. The Mt Fuji stir fry is probably the item with the most flavor."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Everything is amazing.  It's fast, fresh and clean.  My favorites are the natural Cobb, the turkey burger + the dressing and soups are amazing.  I love how they give priority when you take it to go + you can cut the line and get back to work.  There is something for everyone here!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I am a fan because the menu is broad, vegan or not.  Prices are very  fair and most of the  employees try hard to please the customer,  On my last visit this summer, though, things were different:  the turkey special was dry and tasteless, followed by a slice of Boston cream pie which was dry and tasteless.  I made it a point to tell the cashier when we were exiting and she seemed not to care.  Ouch!  It was a stare stand-off!  I asked for the manager and the cashier said that he was not in.  I asked who was in charge then and she answered that no one really but all the employees were??  Who is running the restaurant?  I hope they get their act together because we visit SB 4 times a year."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"On Santa Barbara's charming State Street, The Natural Cafe is a haven for those seeking quality vegetarian, vegan, and healthy dishes.  Although there are a few items which include chicken or fish, the majority of the menu is vegetarian - and trust me, these dishes are so good, you won't miss the meat. From delicious veggie tacos to amazing burgers (your choice - turkey, tempeh, whole grain veggie) pastas to sandwiches, the Natural Cafe has something for every one.  We have been many times, and our children love it too! My favorites are the Buddha Burrito and the Nachos Grande are fabulous. Portions are huge, wait staff are friendly and helpful, and the location can't be beat.  This is definitely one of our favorites when we are in SB!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Delicious and healthy place to be at. I love the salads and black bean veggie burritos. Vanilla shakes are incredible. Everything is local and organic which leaves me feeling great after eating here. Servers are friendly and the place is vibrant and inviting. Great place to be at with friends, colleagues, or just yourself. I'm a regular here!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The food here is so good.  Casual atmosphere.  One must find there own table and are given a number after ordering at register.  The salads are big and the menu has a good variety of dishes- all available with tofu.  I get the Natural Chicken Caesar salad.  The Caesar dressing is vegan and very tasty and the salad comes with fresh avocado.  The prices are cheap and it's nice to sit out on State and people watch.  No, diet coke or alcohol available-hence ""Natural"" Cafe.  :)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"We had a great dinner here.  Our group included two kids, two parents, and two grandparents.  Everyone loved their meals and ate everything on their plates.  The Buddha burrito was huge, healthy, and delicious.  The cornbread was awesome and also huge.  The soup was wonderful.  My daughter wolfed down her garlic bread and kids pasta, then said ""let's eat here every night.""  A great deal for very satisfying healthy food."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The absolute best thing on the menu is the guacamole. It is simply delicious and tastes very authentic to Mexican guacamole. Other items such the burgers and sandwiches are made with care and have a good size to them. 4 stars because the service could be better, i.e., tip=more guacamole."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Outstanding food and healthy ingreadients. I love having lunch at the Natural Cafe. I am addicted to their Old town salad. It consists of brown rice, romaine lettuce, shreded carrots, feta cheesse, tomatoe, avocado and tahini dressing. Simple ingredients but extremely delicious. The avocado and feta add so much flavor you do not really need to add the dressing. I usually get a cup of soup on the side, their soups vary every day but whatever it is that they have it's probably delicious. I personally love the tomatoe basil and the potatoe soup. I've tried other items in the menu and I have always left very satisfied. For some reason the food at this location is much better than the one in Goleta, eventhough they have the same menu the food taste a little different."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Our family traveled down to Santa Barbara for the first time to see the fireworks. We ate here the day before the 4th. I ordered our dinner for us with the young cashier. My husband and I get served first and that started me wondering where were our daughters' pizzas? We waited a bit longer and finally I tell my husband to go up and ask. The man asks my husband to show his receipt. Apparently the girl didn't get the pizza orders! Yet how did she get our smoothie orders which were said to her right after the children's pizzas?

And to top it off, my husband had to pay for the pizzas afterwards. I totally found that bad customer service as the man did nothing to make up for it. This ruined my dinner for me. I don't care how good and generous the food is. I will never eat at any of this chain again."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"My mom, sister and I decided to try this place after a couple days in a row of eating tacos and/or seafood on the various beaches between SB and LA. We were actually all feeling in need of some vegetables, we wanted less fried and more fresh, and we figured our best bet for that would be in downtown SB. We totally lucked out finding this place on Yelp and were all very happy!

I ordered the spinach salad and added grilled chicken to it.  The salad had a pile of baby spinach, plus artichoke hearts, sliced black olives, shaved carrot, feta cheese and alfalfa sprouts. The amount of chicken was huge, and dressing was on the side - your choice from several; I chose the tahini and was very pleased. The entire salad tasted great, everything was very fresh, and it was a great portion size.

My sister got the tostada salad with greens, salsa, guac, cheese and veggies, plus blue corn chips, and also got the tahini dressing. She liked her combo and ate everything.

My mom got the grilled eggplant sandwich which was served on really nice bread with a side of salsa. The eggplant was cooked well and paired with kale and some sauce that she enjoyed. 

Overall a very successful meal in terms of food quality, portion size and value.

Have to also mention the service - we were all a little frazzled from the day and feeling the heat, and having a hard time deciding what we wanted. The woman who took our order was patient, answered all our questions and made suggestions, and also helped us find a spot to eat outside where there was a breeze (most of the outside tables are configured for 2 people so we needed to move stuff around to fit 3). We were really happy with her service, and pleased to be able to eat outside, on busy State street, and people watch as we ate. 

I would definitely recommend this place - they have a great variety of things to choose from and are very accommodating!  Plus I thought prices were great considering the quality, quantity and location. Go here!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I am so impressed with every dining experience I've had in Santa Barbara!  Regardless of what you are looking for you will find it here and chances are it will be excellent!  If you are looking for a delicious, healthy lunch spot then look no further.  Located right on State St, lots of good people watching and comfortable if you sit outside.  They offer vegan & vegetarian options as well as carnivore options as well.  All the food is fresh and prepared with a personal touch and unique presentation.  Honestly you can't go wrong with whatever you order here..  You'll leave smiling and satisfied."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,I have eaten at The Natural Cafes probably a hundred times. The food is always great and healthy. I love the service and the atmosphere. The best restaurants around.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Very yummy soups and sandwiches! Love the homemade bread!  Good atmosphere too!  They even let us taste a sample of the soups before ordering. Nice touch!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I stopped at the restaurant on 9/11/14 to place a to go order.  I ordered the special of the day since I figured that would be prepared quickly.  The upside is that the food was mostly delicous but the to-go service was terrible.  I saw my order come out and get placed on a counter with many other to go items.  I didn't want to assume that it was mine and since the person who took my order said that they would call my name when it was ready I assumed that it must be someone elses.  However, after waiting 25 minutes for my order and not seeing any of the to-go orders being called I was finally able to catch someone's attention and sure enough it was my order that had been sitting there.  The young lady gave me my order and apologized and then dashed off but didn't attend to the other orders sitting there.  It is very busy at lunch so it wasn't like anyone was sitting around and not doing anything.  But if we had all that time to wait for a to-go order I think most of us would opt to eat in.  We place our orders to go because we don't have time to eat in.  The food was delicous but of course the Pita was all soggy by the time I got back to my office.  I will not be back.  There are plenty of other restaurants on State with good food and excellent service whether you eat in or eat out."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"They had cream of mushroom soup on their daily specials board, so I had to go for it.

I got their half sandwich/soup combo, and it was a great meal at a great price. The turkey sandwich was made with fresh turkey and it tasted really great -- it could have used a bit more moisture, maybe a pesto sauce or something like that. It's hard to make turkey breast moist. The mushroom soup was delightful, and it came with some blue corn tortilla chips and salsa. 

Perfect amount of food at a great price. I had a bit of their arugula salad too -- tasted so fresh and zippy!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I am a carnivore. 

I went to a vegetarian friendly restaurant. 

Shocker: I was not impressed. 

I tried the lasagna and while decent it lacked something. 

If you're a vegetarian this place may be the bee's knees but for me it just wasn't the place to be. Sorry, natural cafe."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Pita and hummus was really good.   Caesar salad was good, but nothing out of this world.  Friend got falafel, which she said was just okay.  

It's a nice alternative to traditional greasy fast food, but nothing about it was all that fast.  My friend and I both felt like they must have gone out back to kill the cow, and we didn't even order meat dishes!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"the food was alright, and the place was clean and neat but the service was not good at all. The girl at the register was not nice to my girlfriend and was really rude to her. Also after eating when we asked for a box we waited for a long time and ended up getting it myself...
Next time we go to Santa Barbara we are going to a place worth spending our money on."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Good food.  Great location for lunch in Santa Barbara.  Healthy food at a good price.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Very hard to find good vegan-friendly/vegetarian food in Santa Barbara. The staff at the location is friendly and the food is always good. I've only been slightly disappointed once when I got a huge chunk of ""grilled"" (aka practically raw) onion in my veggie sandwich--but it wasn't a big deal. I just didn't eat it.

A must try is the ""natural tamale."" It's absolutely delicious! The grilled veggie sandwich and the grilled portobella mushroom sandwich are also must-tries!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Hands down for this casual restaurant!!
I love the vegetarian menu, the salads are sooo goodd !! 
The place is just lovely!!!!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Excellent marinara, pita bread pizza was very good, very affordable with good portions."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Not bad. Clean, fresh and healthy! At least that's how I felt.
Meat, Vegetarian, and Vegan-friendly establishment (minus the red meat) with walk-up order type. A number placard will be assigned and food is delivered to your chosen seating area (outdoor front patio or indoor). We had the Roasted Turkey sandwich on 9-grain bread w/ dijon and garlic mayo and it was delicious! All dishes comes with dark corn chips and salsa. Also ordered Split Pea Soup, and Guacamole with Chips. Overall very healthy and tasty meal. Guacamole itself was good but just a tad salty, Split Pea Soup had a very 'herbal' taste and the 9-grain bread is somewhat on the sweeter side. Prices are reasonable on certain items and service was prompt. Overall a great place for light lunch."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Great food! Fresh and delicious. We had the quesadilla appetizer and the chicken tacos. Split them both and left feeling satisfied. Would definitely recommend!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,I haven't lived near a natural cafe in 20 years yet I still dream of yogi special and tahini poppyseed dressing and try to go whenever I am in town!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Classic healthy menu with a Tex-Mex flair. Vibrant, open space that serves sprouts plus burgers, tacos and great salads."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I went here twice in one day. That's how much I enjoyed their food. It's an ""order and pay at the counter"" sort of place, and they have cozy outdoor seating."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I went here almost twice a week for three years while I lived in Santa Barbara. It's apathy vegetarian spot with a few chicken and fish dishes.
My favorite is the falafel. Super yummy and filling! 
The natural salad is also delicious with the tahini dressing. The veggies are super fresh and delicious.
If you need meat in your life, my husband likes to get the Caesar salad with chicken, and the gobbler burger!"

I will visit Santa Barbara again and defiantly go back to Natural Caf!  Inexpensive prices for great food!
Grilled Veggie sandwich - YUM"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"How can a simple avocado sandwich be so delicious?  What sort of magic sweets do they put in their peanut butter shakes?  How is it that over half of the male patrons are sporting cozy fleece zip-ups, beards and pony tails?  These are just some of the mysterious wonders of the Natural Cafe--a sunny, peaceful, and always reliable lunch spot when visiting Santa Barbara."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"This cafe has a nice, clean ambiance with plenty of seating inside, as well as an outdoor patio that was really nice to eat outside in the sun. 

I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich based on the recommendation of the girl working there and had it with feta cheese per her suggestion. It was dry and pretty bland, leaving me drooling over my BF's fish tacos that were absolutely fantastic. The fish is not breaded and soggy, but rather marinated in this fresh, lime juice and topped with cabbage/carrot slaw mix. The tortillas were nice and light and the flavor was refreshing. 

The overall vibe here is obviously health-oriented so dishes are fresh and light. I would have preferred more flavor in my dish. It would have been 4 stars had both dishes been at the level of the fish tacos. Get them with feta cheese instead of the pepper jack!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"There were so many great food items on this menu, I didn't even know where to begin! Alas, I was only hungry enough for one meal.  The food here was fresh and delicious, and I loved that it was walking distance from so many attractions downtown.  There's also a waterfront shuttle stop right across the street, which made it so easy to get to from our hotel."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The zen burger was one of the most delicious veggie burgers I've had in a long time. Good selection, simply delicious, good prices and friendly staff. Very casual. Great place overall!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I ordered the Primo Pesto pasta of the day. It comes with garlic bread and a side salad. Price: $8.25.

The garlic bread was good, the side salad wasn't bad, but the pesto was the most flavorless pesto I've ever had. It had some feta cheese on it, which helped to give it some flavor, but there wasn't very much of it. Most of the time I felt like I was eating plain pasta. Also, the service at the ordering counter wasn't very good. The cashier seemed kind of bored and impatient. I don't think I'd go back. I could make better tasting pasta for cheaper and healthier myself.

Finally, the place bills itself as an ""all-natural cafe"", but my salad dressing for my sit-down dinner came in a little plastic container. Didn't seem very ""natural"" to me."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Best falafel i've ever had! Served in a wheat pita with humus, veggies and a sweet sauce on top. Perfect!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I found this little place on Yelp and was eager to try it out, because of the healthy options.

Unfortunately those options did not deliver.
I had their natural salad with grilled chicken and it was not enough.

Their portions are a little on the small side. 
I even asked the cashier if the half size was enough and she said it was, but that was not true.

When my salad came out I was a bit shocked at how little lettuce there was. My salad consisted mostly of sprouts and cherry tomatoes and the romain lettuce was pretty much non existent.

In a nutshell I ended up paying $8.50 for a tiny salad that had some questionable chicken on it. 

The chicken was slightly on the dry side and it was crispy, which means it was over done. It just didn't seem as fresh as I would have liked. 

I'm giving this joint 3 stars, because I might just come back and give this place another whirl. 

Till next time foodie heads!!!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Amaaazzzing food! Such a great place to eat if you're vegan or vegetarian..or just looking to eat fresh & delicious food. I'm obsessed with their Old Town Salad (add tofu well done), corn bread with butter & black bean enchiladas. I bring everyone who visits here.

Service is hit or miss, you mostly do everything yourself. Sometimes you get a nice cashier, sometimes you get a rude high school girl. But otherwise, awesome!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Delicious, simple, natural and healthy! The Fish Tacos are my favorite, along with the prices. The staff is friendly, young and patient.

Every time I come back to Santa Barbara this will be my first stop.  Love it!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,We visited this restaurant for lunch and weren't overwhelmed by the food.  It was above average with some nice selections but it lacked the home-grown mom and pop hippie flavor that I love to see in natural food restaurants.  My grilled veggie dish was tasteless although they were nice enough to give me some tahini sauce to jazz it up.  Smoothies and shakes are great.  Very pleasant inside/outside eating area.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I used to go to the Goleta loc every week. This was my first time trying the state st. location. The food was consistent from what I remember and I was really happy with it. What I didn't like was the cashier/server's way... or working. She never made eye contact, she was stone-faced.... meaning, you smile, she looks at you like she's pissed. Very, unfriendly lady! Very short hair w/glasses. She brought our food to the table, same service. Very different from the service I experienced consistently from their other location... or rather, I never thought about how important it is for the staff to be friendly until now."

Sounds tranquil, at ease with itself. 
But let's take a closer look...
A Killer Quesadilla?
So violence is the natural way?
Must everything be about submission and domination?
Can a man just find a small bit of peace in the world, and maybe a nice sunset, a nice wave?

Yeah, he can, I guess but you've got to keep your eyes open and the
Nachos Chiquitos with blue chips add to that, sort of, kind of.

I usually just stop off for a juice if I'm in the area.
Wide selection. Tasty.

lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,The kid at the front was pushy. Also when asked about what was in the soup he had NO idea. However offered me to try it. Then gave me the option of chicken shredded or grilled. I chose shredded they gave me grilled. Not happy. Will not be back
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Let's be honest: healthy food can be bland at times.  Natural Cafe gets around that as best as it can, and the food is not only merely edible, but tasty.  And you don't roll out of there feeling guilty after clogging your arteries.  Prices are reasonable as well.  Taste-wise, it's a 4.  But the balance of taste and nutrition gives the place a 5."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I have to give this place 5 stars!!! We've been to the one in Ventura, Westlake and this one located in Santa Barbara and they are all amazing!!!!

The food is great, the portions are large, the price point is right on point!

You can get the best turkey burger in California at these restaurants and add as much good stuff as you want to them without the staff looking at you like you're crazy!!!

Feel free to read my other reviews... I am hard to impress in this place every time!

Out of all of the locations we've been to though, the Ventura location is the best!!!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I was expecting something closer to an all vegetarian/vegan place, but it was more of a ""healthy"" eats place which is totally cool. But given they serve both meat and meatless dishes doesn't mean either type of food should be kicked to the curb. They had very few meatless options IMO and the one that I tried that should have been a no brainer to make tasted ""meh"". Don't get me wrong, the food was fresh and the food came pretty fast, but I felt like it was just gimmicky to be healthy  and there was not much cooking involved--just a lot of assembly.  Probably why it came so fast. The food unfortunately succumbed to what people normally think of when you say healthy food--flavorless, small, and unattractive. I won't dock points for presentation, because ultimately it's about the food but just to let you know, healthy delicious food doesn't have to look like saw dust and an overgrown garden. 

Personally, I don't mind paying a premium for food if it is good and well prepared, but the Natural Cafe's food did not measure up to the 4 stars it seems to be getting. I was expecting at least a 3 star rating, but I need to be honest with myself when after eating there I didn't really feel happy with what I ate and unfortunately that's what I got today from the food. 

Maybe it was because I ordered the grilled chicken pita--a non vegetarian option. Maybe that's where I went wrong. I had to add salt, pepper, *gasp* ketchup, and I almost got up to get mustard, but I was just tired of trying to find something to get this thing some flavor. I didn't even know there was mustard in the pita pocket since there was barely any and it was all the way at the bottom! The best thing I had was the blue corn chips and a tablespoon of salsa (which is a pretty pathetic serving...why even include salsa if it's just a tablespoon???). That's pretty much it. Fiance ordered the veggie burger which had more flavor, but was very plain, nothing unique to the establishment. I've had a lot better. They also did not refill (or probably don't refill) drinks (which were over priced). Their veggie juice was also gross (that might just be me, but I took, one sip and lost my appetite. Luckily I had water. To make matters worse, they also had some unfriendly and inattentive staff (talking and chatting to each other-cutting off customer's in mid order which I found rude,  but also didn't take off any points for--just an observation.) Now thinking and reliving it actually upsets me, but at the time I just ignored it because it wasn't worth my time to dwell on small stuff when it was supposed to be a nice relaxing weekend time. Overall, I don't recommend eating here unless you don't mind eating bland food. Unless they revamp their menu and staff, I'll probably not return to this place. I"

lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,I love the food and service at every location except this one....there's one person there (possibly a shift lead or manager) that I'm pretty sure is either always having a bad day or just plain doesn't like me...she never seems to be able to look me in the eye or address me directly...which is a big deal for me...I even used to work at Cafe Blu (RIP) and got the same treatment......customer service is a big part of business! Not really trying to give the down town location my money any longer...everywhere else is a go tho :^)
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Love love love. The Natural Cafe is absolutely amazing. I love the ability and freedom to be able to replace ingredients with vegan options.

lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"We were driving back home from Los Olivos and planned on stopping in Santa Barbara to get food at Adama. When we arrived they were closed till 5 and we didn't want to wait an hour and a half. So we yelped for another spot. This place came up and we decided to give it a go.

On the outside it looked nice but upon walking in you notice that it's a bit disheveled inside. You grab a dirty menu at the door and order upfront at the counter. They have beverages like juice and beer in fridges up front. I asked to sample the soup of the day, which was split pea, and it was really good. I ended up getting the SB veggie grill. It was grilled veggies and brown rice with a balsamic sauce. My fiancé got a burrito and we split the pita and hummus. 

We got to our table, after grabbing some water, and waited for our food. Our friend got his first which was a pineapple and banana smoothie with a tofu veggie bowl. He was really disappointed with his shake but ok with the bowl. Then the rest came out. My bowl had huge prices of veggies (I was bummed they weren't cut smaller) and they were so tough I couldn't bite through them. I asked my fiancé to get me a knife. Oh you also need to grab your own silverware. They don't bring it with your food. 

Any who I couldn't cut my veggies! They were so overlooked and old I couldn't bite or cut through them. I was so annoyed and turned off at this point. I took the plate up to the counter and got my money back. The hummus and pita were ok. Nothing special. There was way to much hummus and not enough pita. Ugh I'm so bummed we went here. Everyone thought the food was over priced and the quality wasn't good. We should of just waited for Adama and if your vegan I would suggest the same."

If you want to try something amazing, get the ""old town salad w/ Tahini dressing"" (I prefer adding chicken)

It's one of the best salad concoctions I've ever had and I've created several addicts after introducing them to it.   Their Zen burgers and the Natural Burgers are great as well.  You really can't go wrong with Natty Cafe.    

Their desserts are great too!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I used to work at Natural Cafe, and even while working there, I NEVER got sick of the food. The menu is so good and diverse and pretty much everything you order is good. From sandwiches, to salads, to tacos and smoothies, everything is always fresh and tasty. My favorites are the grilled eggplant sandwich, portobello mushroom sandwich,  and the old town salad (make sure you get it with tahini and tofu!) Honestly, best tofu I've ever had. It's extra firm and marinated. All in all, I can never get enough Natural Cafe. LOVE this place!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"No raw sprouts here! Tasty, flavorful food.

We had the pesto pasta and the falafel. They were well made. The portion sizes are normal, not Ameri-normous, which is good. The coffee is pretty good. The blueberry smoothie was okay.

lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This is a really big and nice cafe to be in. I would definitely go back to this place if I live in Santa Barbara. d:

On my visit to this cafe, my friend and I ordered their Nachos Chiquitos, Natural Burger and carrot cake. They were really filling, and they tastes pretty good! One thing that I like a lot about what we ordered is that the nachos are blue corn chips. It was a big plate of nachos for only $5.79. The burger comes with tortilla chips; it was really fresh and good. Lastly, the carrot cake was great :D. I rarely eat carrot cake, but my friend said that the carrot cake here is being recommended by many people, so I decided to try it. I did not regret getting it because it was really good! The cake was quite nutty which I like. The icing and the cream are perfect combination with the cake. Yum yum ^^. 

The atmosphere and service was not bad overall. It was a nice place to chill with friends. :]"

lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"This was the first time I visited this restaurant. I was really disappointed. They accommodate gluten free only with lettuce wraps. No gluten free breads for sandwiches. The taste of the meal was very bland.

While I was in the restaurant I observed a sandwich delivered to a table a chip and salsa eaten from that plate and the sandwich picked up and inspected. The waitress came back to the table and after a discussion I didn't hear she took the sandwich away and proceeded to deliver that same sandwich to the next table and left it for them. They ended up sending it back also for another reason. I was appalled by the waitresses actions. It should have been thrown away! I would not return to this restaurant to eat again."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Great atmosphere and organic/vegan/gluten free choices!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I totally loved this place! Awesome food and a great atmosphere, it was a nice little spot in Goleta just off the 101. There was also another one in Santa Barbara, but me and my gf stopped by the Goleta store on our way to horseback riding. 

I ordered the Good Karma Burger with soy cheese, and it was THE best vegetarian sandwich I've ever had! I absolutely fell in love! It also came with tortilla chips and a side of D-lish salsa. My gf got this side of soup (I forget which, but it was awesome in it's own right), and it came with a side of bread.

We got our things to go, and we literally got our food out in 5 minutes, but I think that was because I tipped them. Either way, the service was fast and friendly. The encounter was great, even though it was only a to-go order. 

Bottomline: Definitely recommend dropping by this spot! I will for sure stop by for another bite when I'm in the area again!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,This is hands down the best quality food and value that you can find in Santa Barbara. I have lived away from the area for over one-decade but I still keep coming back here. It's healthy and they have a good variety for protein lovers and vegetarian foodies. Some of my personal favorites are the old town salad with added grilled tofu and that vegetarian Buddha burrito looks pretty freaking awesome :) I've never had a meal go wrong here. But I must confess I miss the spiritual gift shop that used to be attached to the cafe. Now there is a fresh juice bar which rocks but there is still a lot of empty unused space that is dying for some new creative community based energy :)
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Amazing salads for amazing prices. We all loved the food and great service. This place is very casual with self service but the food is worth a visit. We went there twice weithin a day. First for coffee and cookies and later for dinner. We can recommend the Ranch chicken salad and the arugula salmon salad. Everything else looked very good as well.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,A lot of great vegetarian options and the pricing is perfect. Unfortunately we didn't have enough space for dessert.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I need to right a wrong.    Someone just wrote a one star review and that is SO wrong.  The place is better than that.   It isn't fine dining or anything but they are so nice, will make your food any way you want and it is very good.     Think of it as cheap healthy food.   

I like the tempeh tacos, the falafel pita and the turkey burger the best.  I had the nachos too and they were pretty good.   I think I always get out of there spending less than $15 too which you can't always do on State Street.    

Sometimes I get the food to go, they are real good at that!   Call ahead and it will be waiting for you.   But if you eat there, enjoy the patio and watch people go by.  

I really feel like giving them FIVE stars to even out that stupid one star review, but four is being completely honest."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Good service. Self-serving water, utensils, etc. Good quality and taste of food. Calm relaxing music, not blasting music like some restaurants. Not much street noise though on State. Kind employees. Roomie and spacious."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I always find the Natural Cafe to be satisfying.  I have always loved their Zen Burger with garlic mayo.  Their veggie burgers are the best I have ever had and taste nothing like those sick and disgusting frozen patties you get at the grocery store.  I find those Gardenburgers and Boca burgers to be as questionable as ground chuck or hot dogs.  Who knows what the hell is really in any of those.  I am not vegetarian BTW, I just like the Zen Burger that much.  I also like the carrot smoothie, made with vanilla ice-milk, carrot juice, and some nutmeg and cinnamon.  It is a healthier alternative to a thick, heart-clogging milk shake and was surprisingly refreshing.  I too feel that the styrofoam cups are an odd choice, but whatever."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I enjoy eating at The Natural Cafe - although I generally don't venture far from their turkey burger - which in years past - came with a slightly spicy salsa on the side with blue corn chips.   

Last week I brought a group of friends there, most of whom seemed pleased. One ordered soup that came with a delicious-looking wedge of fresh baked bread. Another ordered an Italian dish that looked like baked ziti. The sauce wasn't especially interesting to me (I had a taste) and my friend took most of it home in a takeout box. My turkey burger was overcooked; the meat was black as it sat on the hamburger roll it was served with. And the salsa had lost its zing which I appreciated in the past. 

The biggest issue I have with The Natural Cafe locations here in Santa Barbara is the absolutely awful wooden seats at the tables that seat four people. We customers are put on uncomfortable chairs because... they are natural? As in ""the natural cafe"" kind of natural? Wood is wood, and for the purpose of dining, flat wooden seats are very unpleasant (for me) to sit on for more a couple minutes - I wonder if using uncomfortable chairs is intentional - a way to turn over the table to new customers faster? (Other restaurants do this too). I once brought my own seat cushion to the restaurant as a way to compensate for the uncomfortable seating there. When I was 16, I could sit on stone and feel okay, but at the age of 65, I need a padded chair or booth. Back pain is ""natural"" too - but that doesn't make it pleasant."

Lots of options, for meaty meat eaters or not... ok well, not for meaty meats, but for like chicken fishy meat eaters...

The husband and I biked all over town and were hungry! We have eaten here before on previous trips, but for some reason this time was the best! (Maybe it was the 80 degree weather and the endorphins?)

First time... 
I got the veggie burger, yum yum, sauteed purple onion yuuuuuum!
He got the baked potato and veggies with beans and guacamole (he made this concoction by ordering a bunch of sides, it was delish!

2nd trip
I ordered some brown rice bowl with veggies and tofu it was a heffty price tag (so I thought at first... $9.75) for 3 simple things, but the plate was huuuuuuuuuuuge and sooo good! He got a salad and some more sides, we will be back again and again!

lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Went into Natural Cafe this past Wednesday for a quick dinner. I ordered the Teriyaki sandwich. Ate the first half. Tasted fine. 

Picked up the second half. About to take a bite when I notice a grey/ slimy looking ball sitting on the sprouts. I take a closer look, and it's moving. 

Yup. It's a slug. A small live slug hanging out on my sandwich. 

Upon discovery, i immediately took the plate to the waitress who then apologized and took it back to the kitchen. The kitchen said it was most likely from the sprouts. 

They gave me my money back for the sandwich, which was nice. Unfortunately, I don't think i'll ever be able to go back. It's a shame too since i really liked the place.

So the key takeaway here: CHECK YOUR FOOD FOR SLUGS BEFORE EATING! (especially if your food has sprouts!)

Gross :("
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Thank God for successful yelp finds! I found this little restaurant on my day trip to Santa Barbara. Looking at the menu I realized it was up my alley, considering the healthy choices and wet burrito option! I chose the Baja Burrito which is served wet style with a side of salad topped with alfalfa sprouts and cherry tomatoes. The Burrito comes with rice, beans, shredded chicken  (juicy and not dry), and topped with delicious avocados, and sour cream! I was no longer ""hangry"" (hungry and angry). This Burrito was super flavorful and the smell made my mouth water!! I will for sure be coming to this place again. I liked the music here too and the ambience was nice and sunny. I loved it!"

Consider yourself given full warning of the potential impact of this phenomenon.

I ordered a vegetarian entree, black bean enchilada and an Italian salad. I did not expect the food to taste so good as the cafe didn't look that great. It was heavily crowded and we couldn't find a place for the first ten mins. But when the food arrived, I just kept eating., food was awesome. I was not able to finish it and packed some to take back home."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"If you are into keeping it healthy this is the place for you.  Good vibes, indoor and outdoor seating, great juices and fast service.  I tried the State Street salad and it okay just plain so add some chicken or tuna to it for a better taste.  I would be a regular if I lived closer so I can try everything on the menu."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Amazing!!

I loved this little cafe. Fresh and delicious food, helpful staff, and a great value.

 I had the fresh vegetable juice and a grilled eggplant sandwich served on seven grain bread and devoured with enthusiasm. My husband had the temphi tacos and savored each bite. We also had a guacamole appetizer which was delicious but too much food for only two people.

I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Nice place for lunch on State Street as you stroll around. Stopped in for a quick bite (actually a fresh made turkey sandwich that was quite good). 
Dog friendly patio too.  Casual vibe -- nothing fancy but good value for the neighborhood."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Was just passing through town for the first time and ended up having lunch here.   Had my dog with me and originally tried to eat at another place that had a huge outdoor patio but the hostess said ""uhhh this is like, a restaurant with food and stuff, and dogs have to be tied up outside on the sidewalk...even though we had called ahead and the guy on the phone said it wouldn't be a problem.   So we wandered over to the natural cafe and they were all super nice.  I went in and asked if it was ok to sit on their patio with my dog and of course they said yes because they're all awesome.  My girlfriend and I both really enjoyed our meals.  While eating the famers market opened up along State Street so we walked that afterwards, until we were told no dogs are allowed to walk through the farmers market!  All in All I give the city of Santa Barbra 1 star, for being a bunch of dicks to dog owners, but give The Natural Cafe 5 stars for the great food and staff."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Awesome location. First time dinning in. Very clean and cosy inside and very cute outside. Food is great, a lot of options for both vegans and meat lovers. Great place to have a lunch or dinner and enjoy the mellow Santa Barbara Sunday."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Ich war begeistert. Wir hatten ein chicken teriaki sandwitch mit tacco chips und limonade. Super frisch und lecker. Thank you for your delissious food :)
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,DO NOT EAT HERE. Got severe and violent food poisoning from the chicken in my stir fry. Also when talking to my friend about it she said her sister used to work at natural cafe and that employees don't always wash their hands and that it was pretty unhygienic in general. Save yourself from a long night of retching.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I love love LOVE this cafe. Every time I visit SB, I always make sure I have lunch here. I also make it a point to tell as many people about this place as possible. It's so good!

The first time I came here I tried their Roasted Turkey sandwich and the Pineapple Coconut shake. The Roasted Turkey sandwich was super yummy and full of fresh veggies. This sandwich was interesting in that they used a variety of veggies not seen in a typical sandwich. The Pineapple Coconut shake was amazing! I could definitely taste the chunks of pineapples and pieces of coconut. 

Second time around I ordered the Mr. Natural and a hummus plate to share with my friend. The Mr. Natural is a plate of brown rice covered in fresh steamed veggies. I added tofu and chicken to upgrade the meal a bit. It sounds boring but trust, it tasted amazing. It was the wholesome, filling lunch I was craving. The hummus plate was huge! Lots of fresh veggies, pita bread, and a huge dollop of hummus. My friend and I couldn't finish the hummus plate so we took it to go. 

What I love about this cafe is they use seasonal veggies picked fresh daily from the Botanical garden a few miles away, near the Mission. That's why the veggies on some of the dishes on the menu change every season. I think it's a great way to change up the menu, get people to try different veggies, and still use fresh, local produce. 

I can't wait to make my annual trip up to SB just so I can eat here again. Already planning my next meal!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Great food and friendly service. Their guacamole is delicious!  My salad was fresh and there were lots of healthy dressing choices available.  Kids pasta was tasty and had the right combination of butter and cheese.  Will be back again next time we are in Santa Barbara.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Don't think I ever have given such a poor rating?!  Service so poor...like talking to a first grader upon ordering.  Dirty conditions, order wrong, and food barely ok.  Order not complete then server reply...""well you can get back in line to order that side?"" WTF...I have my food in hand with family hungry and now you want me to go back into line.  Manager fortunately understand and brought the side dish gratis.  Will never ever come back to this hole again."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Always very busy for lunch so expect a wait and stake out a table.  That said - they have a great menu and I have been happy with all items that I have ordered here.  The Enchiladas are great and so has all salads that I have ordered.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Woah, 4 stars? Really?
I didn't think this place was that good... but perhaps I ordered the wrong thing.  I had the Santa Barbara grilled veggies something or other.. it came with brown rice as well.  The veggies consisted of two very large pieces of eggplant (which was weird and dry), as well as zucchini, onions, and bell peppers.  Those were fine.  Overall, it was eh.  It only really gets a 3 star because I sampled some other items and I thought it was pretty good.

The service was friendly and the place was pretty clean..so it's not a terrible place to stop by for lunch."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This cafe is AMAZING! Every time I come to Santa Barbara, I always need to stop by the Natural Cafe. Their food is amazing! You can literally taste the freshness! Because of my obsession with carbs, I always judge the bread at different restaurants. The bread that this cafe has is by far THE BEST bread that I have ever had! I was so in love that I decided to buy two of their 9 grain wedge breads and a loaf of their toast. I believe that they special order their bread fresh from the Wild Flour Bakery in Agoura Hills. 

The prices here are a bit on the expensive-side, but it's definitely worth-it for the quality of the food that you get. If you are looking for a healthy, delicious, and fun place to eat during your time at Santa Barbara, I would definitely recommend the Natural Cafe. They also have a self-service coffee station, which I find really convenient. This eatery is located right on State Street, so it is a great stop if you are shopping in the area and want something light for lunch."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"AMAZING food. It is healthy and tasty. Their ceaser is really good and the best thing on their menu is the pastas, especially the pesto pasta. Try it once and you'll be hooked."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Chicken Enchildas. Sublime. There are Natural Cafe's all over--from SLO to TO. Just an FYI--in Ventura it's called the Nature's Grill, and it's on Main Street near the Ventura Theater. Anytime you need a fix, you can count on the awesome healthy menu and the hugest salads I have ever seen! Mmmm. I love to have my birthday dinner pre-parties here--everyone can pay for their own meal at the counter, and we can be casual and come at different times and just push a few tables together and chilllll."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Love this place! Healthy selections and very yummy~  

Comfortable dining and staff are very helpful and polite!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The Natural Cafe is not quite vegetarian, but it is veggie friendly, with extensive herbivorous options and a smattering of meat and fish dishes. Similarly, The Natural is not a Mexican restaurant, but it leans heavily in that direction with little pasta and hummus spread between the beans and tortilla that dominate the extensive menu.

I was not expecting the homeliness of the place - it's counter service and they bring your food and beer to the Formica table, the prices were reasonable, reflecting the no-frills presentation.

The food was excellent for the most part - my black-bean enchiladas were delicious and filling and my dining partner's Super-natural platter was nice with beans, rice, cheese, and vegetables, though the sweet cornbread that it all sat on may have been taking the cross-over theme a little too far."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This place had wide variety of healthy foods. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. The food tasted great and made me feel good and healthy afterwards. The flowers and candles on the tables added a sweet touch, and the art on the walls were colorful and fun to look at. The staff was very nice and helpful."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,My husband and I ate here this morning. My husbands Cobb salad had a large living bug in the bowl of course after he almost finished the entire salad. He brought his plate to employee to show them and was never offered money back. Instead she asked him what he wanted her to do about it and asked him if he wanted anything else. Seriously would never eat here again. Extremely disappointed that she at least didn't comp our meals or at least the salad. Just hoping he didn't eat any bugs before he saw the one.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"As a vegetarian, I can find a lot to eat at this restaurant.  And my wife is not a vegetarian, but she finds things she likes here as well.  Just go to the counter and order your food, take a number and sit down either inside or outside.  Your food will be delivered to your table.  My favorite is the Zen and Natural burgers.  Although I would be happy with other menu items as well.  And check out their desserts.  Their carrot cake is delicious."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I eat here probably 3-4 days a week and there isn't a thing on the menu I don't love.  My favorite is the Old Town salad, but I've had almost all of their salads, their turkey burger, a bunch of different tacos on their daily special board and the smoothies and they're all delicious and well-priced. I love that their smoothies are made of fruit and juice only with no yogurt or sherbert.  The people who work here are also great, super friendly.  Love this place."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"En menukaart met genoeg keuze en gerechtjes voor leuke prijzen. Niet bijzonder, maar gewoon lekker, gemakkelijk en redelijk gezellige setting."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"A nice break from all of the indulging I did earlier in the weekend.  Vegetarian options galore.  Although its not die hard eco-correct, you don't feel judged if you use 2 napkins instead of 1.  The service was sort of slow and we watched our waitress carry around our food for like 10 minutes before she found us (it was kind of entertaining).  The food was pretty good though.  I would go back."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"The Natural Cafe is A-OK. Located on State Street, we stopped in here on a Friday afternoon as we were strolling down to the beach. It's order-at-the-counter, and there wasn't much of a line, so the wait was quick. I ordered the fish tacos (I'm from North Texas, so any excuse to eat fish in a coastal town I'm going to take). My boyfriend ordered the tuna fish sandwich with a side salad. My mom ordered the cup of vegetable soup, and my dad ordered the nachos. 

Only my boyfriend was truly wowed by his food. If he were writing this review based on his experience of the food alone, I think he probably would give them 5 stars. He loved the sandwich and the salad, and I tasted both and have to say they were great. The rest of us were okay with our meals, but not all that impressed. My fish tacos were a little strange. They were smothered in tomato sauce and cheese, and topped with lots of shredded carrot. It wasn't bad, just a little odd. It was served with blue corn tortilla chips and salsa, which were pretty good. 

My mom found her soup to be too salty, and the bread served with it tasted stale to her. My dad's nachos weren't too warm when they arrived, and quickly got cold as he ate them. He found it odd that there was so much salsa and no beans at all.

Overall, not our favorite spot, but a good option for a healthy meal. The place has lots of vegetarian options, which is awesome. Come here for a sandwich and salad!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,GINORMOUS portions! Awesome salads. Kids loved the tofu dog and chips and guac. Healthy and filling. Mostly veggie options with a huge menu.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I like natural foods as much as anything else and TNC is as fresh as it gets, I just wish that their menu wasn't the same dishes disguised as many dishes... everything I have ever eaten there has tasted just like everything else on the menu... if you like one dish there you never have to look at the menu again as anything you order will taste exactly like your original dish.  I must admit that they DO have killer smoothies and milk shakes, though."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Not bad for a 'trending chain. I had the stir fry chicken which was chock full of veggies and hot steaming rice. The have beer (bottles only) which is a huge plus.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"We did a day trip to Santa Barbara and ended up on State Street around dinner looking for a place to eat. We stumbled upon the Natural Cafe and was so glad we did. My wife ordered the Chicken burrito and I had the grilled chicken pizza served on a whole wheat pita. 

The were both pretty good with my wife's burrito winning out on flavor. The employees at the cafe were very nice and the food was served fairly quickly.  

If you are looking for something healthy and a little different while on State Street, you should check this place out."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"This place is okay, now granted I may just have had a ""TAINTED"" experience with this place because my first time here I ordered a burrito and ended up chomping down on a rock. YES, a FRICKIN' ROCK!  I was instantly disgusted and ultimately confused on how the hell a rock would end up in my food. 
My man friend was kind enough to take my food up to the counter and explained what happened...after a few minutes I received a free smoothie, but I was a bit upset that they didn't do more...like OH, I don't know like COMPING my meal????!!!?! wtf.

I've been here 2 other times and the food is ""meh"". I'm not impressed at all. The food is bland, but I feel that there is potential here. I'm just apparently not experiencing it.

BEWARE:
Rocks end up in the food and you do not get a valid explanation or a refund."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Amazing food and smoothies! Service was quick and efficient. Would recommend the spiritual spinach salad with grilled chicken! Definitely coming back!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,This is a great place to stop and get great food. Love hanging on State St. Went to visit a few times and ended up staying awhile. Sweet prices and really good food here. Can't wait to go back. What's not to love about Santa Barbara.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Ate here twice while visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend. I ordered the Kelly Burger with a side salad and tahini dressing and it all tasted delicious. Ingredients were fresh and healthy and the burger came with chips and salsa. Also, the servers were all very kind and even helped my group of 7 to rearrange the outdoor tables to seat all of us and moved umbrellas so we could be in the shade. Will be sure to visit again next time I am in town."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I've been here three times now and I surprised I'm not here more. I always have a hard time deciding what to get because I want EVERYTHING. 

Black Bean Tostada Salad (?) 
     - It was a special of the day, came with a side of Chicken Pozole. 
     - The portions were huge. 
     - Good Mexican fix, but still somewhat healthy. 

Vegetable Quesadilla 
     - SO GOOD, comes with side salad. The lemon vinaigrette was ok. 
    
Old Town Salad
     - I would recommend getting this! I got the half salad, and it was a good size. I might add tofu in it next time. 
     - Comes with brown rice, shredded carrots, scoop of guac and the tahini dressing (BEST THING EVER- GET IT) 

Vegetarian Chili
      - It comes with the corn bread and honey butter. Its SOO good! The bread is warm and somewhat crumbly, so hearty. 
      - They did not skimp on the ingredients in the chili, super filled and FILLING."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,This place is great for lunch or dinner. I love to eat healthy food and I love the old town salad with sautéed tofu and brown rice. I'm a gourmet organic chef as well as a nurse and I love the healthy choices and natural café offers.  Prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I have loved this place for so long. The variety on the menu will accommodate anyone, veggie or not.  I am always satisfied with the pesto pasta, eggplant sandwich, and veggie chili dog (I never really liked real hot dogs but this is really good). Oo oo and the carrot shake too!!!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Really fresh, healthy and delicious food. I had the old town salad and my friend had the gobbler burger. Very impressed with their food and the outside is gorgeous (didn't sit inside). Also reasonably priced."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Lots of yummy and filling options here for vegetarians, and at a reasonable price.  I've eaten at this location as well as the one in Goleta a number of times and have always been happy with the food and service.  Casual style, order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table.  Great for families too!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"This hippie place is not as cheap as it should be. The pros: good, healthy smoothies (no frogurt or sherbert), tasty soups, good veggie options, sexy girls work there. The cons: too expensive for what it is, their sexy employees provide terrible service."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Solid little joint. On days when you're craving something healthy but still delicious, this is a standby. I was truly craving some steamed veggies without the effort of making anything myself, so I drove over to The Natural Cafe. Given the high number of upscale restaurants in the area, I appreciated the more lax, actual cafe set up here, where you go up to the bar to order and pick your own table. While the vibe is more laid back, all the finishings are nice so you still feel like you're getting your money's worth.

I tried one of their daily specials-teriyaki glazed salmon, brown rice, and steamed veggies. My plate was steaming when it came to my table-always a good sign. The veggies were perfect-tender enough to enjoy but with enough bite to still arriviste the flavor. I also appreciated the large portions, given that the plate was $15. My salmon ended up being pretty dry, and it felt like the sauce was just that-a sauce added right at the end, not really incorporated any other way into the salmon. I really appreciate how clean everything tasted, but I couldn't finish that salmon. Overall I'm glad I came here, but I think I might just go with grilled chicken next time instead."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Delicious! This place has a great atmosphere that's well lit and very cheery. I love going here for health foods when I'm feeling pretty hungry, but not hungry enough to resign myself to pulling into a drive through at Jack in the Box. The options all leave you feeling fulfilled and happy, without the stomachache later. Cute flowers on the table, and a great place to go for lunch. A must try!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,This was a decent spot on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara.  The focus is is fresh and healthy meals. I went with a salad that had slices of grilled chicken - when the plate came out I was pleasantly surprised by how large the portions were.  For $12 + change I felt the value was good for what I got.  If you're looking for a relatively clean meal while in the area this is a good bet.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This healthy vegetarian cafe on State Street is worth checking out. My mouth fell in love with the tahini hummus and pita appetizer and I probably would have ordered seconds had I not already placed an order for my main course.  Thankfully my main course was just as yummy.  I had the Eggplant-Sprout and red pepper sandwich with nachos on the side-HEAVEN!! My boyfriend ordered the pesto with feta pizza which he described as ""one of the best vegetarian pizzas I have ever eaten"".  Everything was so fresh tasting and superb.  I'll definitely be coming back for more:)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Very serviceable healthy food in the main commercial district. Healthy, quick, and tasty. They execute basics really well."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"This is one of those order-at-the-counter-and-find-your-own-table kind of places. A little annoying, but I guess you save on tip? The line to order was a bit long, but when we did order, the woman was totally helpful and didn't rush us or get annoyed by our questions. I ended up getting the portobella mushroom sandwich and a side salad, and my friend got the veggie burger and a side salad. I also ordered a carrot shake sans whipped cream, which turned out to be sweet and delicious. The mushroom sandwich was flavorful enough given the ultra healthy ingredients, and the side salad with lettuce, carrots, cheese, rice, and guac, was a nice departure from the norm, and the chips and salsa each sandwich came with were totally serviceable. Tasty, healthy food at a good price."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Hmm... Either the options are limited in SB or I am missing something.

I came here from lunch, based upon the reviews and the fact that I had very limited time to assess my options or pick another place.

The menu struck me as fairly pedestrian but all I needed was a decent lunch salad, so I went with the Cobb, which came with fakin' bacon and should have been a clue. Not that I have anything against soy products, but when you choose to offer other animal proteins like chicken, but then eliminate one of the best parts of a Cobb, well?

The salad was fine; nothing great, but certainly fulfilled it's minimal obligation of nourishment. They didn't offer a balsamic vinaigrette dressing, which seems like it should be a felony in California, so I was forced into some honey mustard nonsense, which also didn't help this place's case.

The avocado was mushy, which seems like an oxymoron but it is possible to have a ""mushy in a bad way"" avocado! None of the other ingredients stood out, which is my entire point.

The Cobb salad is a barometer salad and this one didn't didn't hit the mark. You'd be hard pressed to find me back at this place. Too many other options."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,We were looking for something fast and not too expensive but also healthy. And this place is a finding! Most options on the menu are vegetarian. Their smoothies are delicious. I was surprized how popular the place was.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,So good!!! So cheap! Service an A+. Yes it's healthy but if your in a sweet mood there is a candy shop next door! Try their albacore salad!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"After a little hike yesterday, I was starving. To keep with the nature theme, some friends and I came here for lunch. 

It was a very casual place. Grab the menu yourself and then order at the counter. You also have to find your own table. Everything on the menu sounded so good, but I narrowed it down to the sandwich and salad combo. It consisted of half a sandwich, half a Natural salad, and some tortilla chips and salsa. I got the tuna sandwich and the lemon herb dressing for the salad. Everything was really good! The tuna sandwich was amazing. The bread was soft and the tuna was so tasty. The salad was good, too. I loved the lemon herb dressing! The chips and salsa were also good. Everything tasted so fresh! 

Service was good. The atmosphere was light and breezy. We sat at the inside table by the window, which was perfect. The window was open and so we got a little breeze and the view, but without the sun and the bugs. It was great. The prices were also good.

Overall, I had a great time. I thought this place was the perfect representation of Santa Barbara: casual, relaxing, and beautiful."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Food was great but since I'd never been, I didn't realize that you order at the counter. Clearer signage with that would have been helpful. More seating would be great too, but the food was excellent and and it's nice to have vegan options."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Never had anything other than the salads, but I absolutely love them. Especially the albacore and Cesar salad. Fresh ingredients and good price, served in a huge bowl. Also make sure to try the lemon herb dressing :) I make a point to go back there every time I visit Santa Barbara"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Solid option for a quick, affordable lunch downtown Santa Barbara - lots of healthier, veggie friendly options, which was great after being on the road for so long. I ordered a soup/sandwich combo, which was good but nothing special. One of the specialty salads or vegetarian entrees probably would have been more interesting.

Parking in the area is limited, and mostly paid."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"If you know anything about me, you know that I clean my plate.  Not at The Natural Cafe- the portions are too big!

I was impressed with the menu selection, which is Tex-Mex with a healthy twist.  They also have shakes and smoothies.  I had chicken tacos: tortillas LOADED with marinated chicken, fresh lettuce, and sprouts- so good!  My sister had veggie tacos and my mom had veggie quesadillas with a side salad.  It was one of those meals where no one really talks because they're too busy eating.

My only quibbles were that a few of the staff were less than friendly and the noise level was pretty high."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Go to the Sojourner instead.  Natural Cafe is noisy, their ice water tastes like soap, and I think they're trying to asphyxiate me with sprouts.  When I eat here my chakra turns black."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"As a vegan, I am always looking for new vegan-friendly restaurants. The Natural Cafe was recommended to me. I have been here a total of about 4 times, and it has always underwhelmed me. In my most recent visit, I was not able to get anything. First off, the menu does not clearly mark vegan items (or items that can be made vegan), which is annoying. I chose two items that I thought could be made vegan, and was planning to ask about them as I approached the counter. The girl working was distracted and unhelpful. I asked her first about the Primo Pesto, a pasta dish tossed with pesto and topped with feta cheese. I thought possibly the feta could be removed, resulting in a vegan dish. I asked the girl working, and she walked away from the counter into the kitchen, while yelling back to me, ""No, sorry, the pesto has cheese in it."" Well, okay, that's fine. I had another meal planned to ask about I was sure was vegan. I asked her about the Veggie Stir-Fry, which is just veggies tossed with a ginger-soy sauce served over brown rice. She left again, only to return and have me repeat my question. She then proceeded to tell me that no, that meal was not vegan. Why? Because the ginger-soy sauce was not vegan. How ridiculous is that? 7 minutes into trying to figure out what I can order at a so-called vegan friendly restaurant, I gave up. I politely thanked the girl working, who was now cleaning menus five feet away from the cash register, and she gave a distracted, ""Oh, what? Oh, I'm sorry. Bye."" As a vegan I would never recommend this place. It is not worth the trouble, especially in Santa Barbara, a very vegan-friendly place. You're better off somewhere else. Even my non-vegan friends find the food here subpar. Honestly, just save yourself the trouble."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Pretty average. I mean, if you are in a rush and need a decent bite to eat and are too famished to wander off State Street, this place will do. We had the falafel, which I would describe as ultra Caucasian. My partner had the small chicken salad which was massive as you can expect most salads in America to be; but, it was cafeteria quality."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Went with the family. You order at the front and they bring you your food. The salad was unique, different, and delicious. As well as their pasta. Service was fast. Would return if back in town."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Had an amazing vegan burger here!

The ""Good Karma Burger"" with Veganaise instead of the mayo, plus soy cheese.

Delish!

Also, their condiments are all healthy, high-quality ones, their staff is super friendly, and their service is wonderful.

I highly recommend them."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The Downtown SB location:

Order the falafels and tahini sauce!

It's nice to pop in after a day of shopping and walking up/down State St. (or other cross streets). Connected to this location of The Natural Cafe is a store that sells all sorts of spiritual goods.

I really want falafels now. =/ 
Go here for lunch, then go to Arigato (http://www.yelp.com/biz/U2hkeMI-q4cS35QolJYN0A) for dinner!"

Fast service at a good price

Both the Santa Barbara and Goleta locations have great outdoor seating with umbrellas for shade. 

Very dog friendly, the always give my dog water when we come :)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,My friends and I stopped into Natural Cafe road tripping down the coast. The food is delicious and made with ingredients that actually have nutrients in them. It is also pretty reasonably priced considering the quality of food and the part of town it is in. I would highly recommend stopping here if you find yourself hungry in Santa Barbara.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Great food with HUGE portions. We stopped there for lunch and I was stuffed the rest of the day. I had the veggie stir fry and my lunch date had the veggie burrito...both were great. Both of our entrees were under $10, a great price for lunch in Santa Barbara.  Wish we had one of these in Sacramento....."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Not a fan of vegeterian but the natural Cafe is a fabulous spot that everybody has tried at least once and even a carnivore maniac like me can say, ""yeah, OK, it's got flavor, ok vegeterians got it going on."" Attached health food store is pretty snazzy as well. Lots of tinctures and homeopothy remedies, herbs and such. Sorry I broke your statue back in the day. It was a 151 incident gone black ops (black out mode) grrrr!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This is a great place to have lunch or even dinner on State Street before shopping or before a movie. This is one of the better places to eat on State Street. This place is cheap quick and easy. The burritos, falafals and turkey burgers are good. Their tropical iced tea is unique. Everytime I dirve to Santa Barbara for the day I always eat at this place."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"yummdiddleydum. My sisters and I were looking for a place kinda like Intermezzo (maybe now called something else? Did I make that up? I think that's what someone told me) in Berkeley and found it in Natural Cafe. So hard to decide what to order. Finally settled on turkey burger, which was v. good. Guac and chips was good, as was everything else we ordered (as a recall included some sort of chicken salad with really yummy chicken and  lasagna with tasty cheesy garlic bread) Sauteed tofu sounded really good and I almost ordered a side just to taste. Thought better of it and will definitely have a salad with tofu next time. I love places like this that have something for everyone. During the last day of Fiesta, it was nice to sit outside in the sunshine on their sidewalk seating area and take in the sights while enjoying a tasty and reasonably-priced meal."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I'm sorta a food junkie and love to try new places whenever I get the chance (and by chance i mean MONEY). 

So my girlfriend and I went to meet some of her relatives downtown and she suggested we have lunch at The Natural Cafe. She grabbed a salad to go, but I stayed with her family to sit, chat and enjoy our lunch.

As I bit into my wonderful Buddah Burrito, I let the sweet sauteed veggies, cheesy cheese, soft rice, amazing beans, cold sour cream, orgasmic guac, and all the other GREAT flavors sizzle its way onto my tongue, down my throat and into my belly!

The food was great, but the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was for the noisy environment, and the not so intelligent register girl who messed up my first order.

Not somewhere I'd return with someone who I hadn't seen in a long time, but definitely for a short lunch date :)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"After a day of shopping my friend and I headed down State Street for some eats.  The Natural Cafe is a favorite of my friends so I thought I should give it a try.  Natural Cafe has an extensive assortment of great salads, vegetarian and Mexican dishes.  It is a great casual spot to have lunch and chat with friends or to soak up some the sun on the patio and people watch. 

The portions are huge but as my friend pointed out, you're not eating fast food or processed junk so you don't feel gross or guilty afterwards.  Keep in mind that she did not order the burrito that the person next to us did.  That thing was HUGE.

Overall a great spot if you are looking for a casual lunch outside of the shopping madness."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Pleasantly surprised.

Vegetarian places tend to lack flavor but damn, that chili hot dog was huge and awesome.  Best vegetarian chili I ever had in my entire life.  The tofu hot dog in the middle wasn't bad... wasn't great.. wasn't bad.

The pita falafel sandwich was good, and refreshing.  But the taste of the falafel balls themselves just had this odd, raw flavor I really can't explain.  Again, there was something really cool, refreshing with the flavor but man, that raw deal just sort of left me not able to finish it."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Nice healthy food.   The portions were a good size and the prices were reasonable.   For those of you looking for something different, this is the spot."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"We are vegetarians and this restaurant had a nice selection of food for us.  They also have very creative salads.  It's not a fancy place at all but it was convenient, healthy, and yummy at the end of a day of sightseeing."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I love the Natural Café. Good for all things healthy and natural of course! I always get the Ranch Salad, the chicken here is pretty good. So flavorful for natural and healthy food! (Who said healthy was bland and boring?) The staff is pretty friendly and I always feel good knowing that nothing artificial is in it. 

On rare occasions though, I have to admit, the chicken isn't cooked so good. I layed off their smoothies too after getting sick once (the fruit probably hadn't been too fresh).  -__-  Otherwise, I'm pretty positive about this place. :D"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"My husband and I have eaten here about once a year or more for the past ten years and the quality of their food has gone way down. There is very little natural about the Natural Cafe. They may have a lot of vegetarian options but they're the most unhealthy vegetarian options I've seen. Everything has cheese or cream in it. The only actual healthy option you have is stir fried veggies that are ridiculously overpriced.

So the food we had this time: I ordered the zen burger and my husband got the veggie chili. The zen burger is, swear to god, just a frozen garden burger like the morning star ones you buy at the store. It was barely warm, obviously heated in the microwave, and totally flavorless. On top of that, it comes with only lettuce, tomato, sprouts, and mayonnaise (gross). I ordered it without the mayo (because mayo is gross and totally bad for you) and it was like eating a dry piece of cardboard. People, healthy food CAN actually taste good if you try! So, I smothered it in mustard and that was that. My husbands chili was also barely warm and looked like it just came out of a can (tasted like it too). With it, they served a mammoth sized cube (like 6in x 6in) of burn your mouth microwaved cornbread accompanied by a scoop of butter in a non-recyclable plastic cup (mind you, we ate in the restaurant so plastic crap is unnecessary). Sadly, i'd say the cornbread and blue corn chips (side for the burger) were the best things we ate. 

Don't be fooled by the title of this cafe. It's basic cafeteria food that's reheated and made somewhere else most likely. If you want something healthy AND good, go to Adama or even Wahoos."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Food was super fresh. I had a salad and a smoothie. We sat outside and the service was great. I really appreciated the basic, fresh, and healthy ingredients in all the dishes. The smoothies were also great- no added sugar or anything!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Love this place! Came here with a large group of 20 & were in and out with our food in 15 minutes. Great sandwiches & kind staff. Would definitely go back when in the area!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This place is really as good as it gets for well made clean tasty good for you food. The staff is sweet. I like how eclectic the customer base is all ages, etc.   Just spot on go to place, matter of fact I think I'll go right now!  Oh try the corn bread.  I'm looking foward to winter to have the soups.  Prices are really reasonable and the portions are great."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Very healthy. Organic. I had the turkey burger, which was very flavorful and tasty. Liked the wheat bun as well. It comes with blue chips and salsa. Salsa is a bit garlicy and oniony, but still very good. It's a good alternative when you want something that doesn't feel like it will clog your arteries.

The bathrooms are in the giftshop area and have an interesting coin/key door lock."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I love this place. I went here for dinner my first night in Santa Barbara and the food was superb. The next day I took a friend out to lunch who lives in Santa Barbara and he chose to go to the same café and said it was a place that he and his wife usually go to. 
I kept wanting to go back but felt I should try some other places while I'm in Santa Barbara.
I will definitely go there again the next time I visit Santa Barbara"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"This place has such amazing reviews, but I really did not have a good experience.  Their fish tacos, Meh! Definitely not your traditional fish tacos. They were not good and the rice was hard as a rock.  

I was so excited to try this place because everyone raved about it. The hotel we stayed at, the locals, and even some of my friends.  When I went back to tell them that it wasn't as amazing as they mentioned, they said ""oh, you should've gotten a salad"".  I guess if Im ever around next time, ill try one of their salads."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"OK, so about 6 years ago I used to love The Natural Cafe.  And why not?  It provided healthy meals at a time when I wasn't much of a cook.  Now that I cook almost every night, making healthy and delicious food, I find that the Natural Cafe just doesn't cut it.

On a recent trip to Santa Barbara I decided to stop at the Natural Cafe to grab something for dinner on the road.  I got the steamed veggies and tofu plate with the tahini dressing while my husband got the chicken quesadilla with a side of chips and guacamole.  

I would think it's difficult to ruin a steamed veggie plate but somehow they did.  The vegetables were steamed to mush and did not taste very fresh while the tahini sauce was oddly sweet, watery, and far from satisfying.  After the veggie disappointment, I decided to have some chips and guacamole, you know, as a last ditch effort to finish on a good note.  

Now I am a CA girl born and raised so I know about good guacamole...and this was NOT it.  It tasted like someone had spilled a vat of white vinegar into the mixing bowl.  I don't know of any recipe that calls for vinegar in guacamole.  Perhaps they were trying to keep it from turning brown but is any case, it was completely unpalatable.

It pains me to write such things about a restaurant I used to love.  That being said, I think it is important to hold whole foods/natural restaurants to a high standard.   Otherwise new ""health food"" inductees will continue to think health food tastes bad and is not worth the effort."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Please move a branch to the Bay Area!  I love this place and would eat here at least once a week.  God, the salads are yum.  The government should subsidized tree hugger restaurants like this to keep our health care costs down.  I know I would eat more salads if a place like this was around the corner."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Delicious vegetarian (and meat-atarian) dishes that are fresh, healthy, and natural. I had the special of the day: veggie enchilada with a mushroom soup, and it was delish! Also recommend the portabella mushroom sandwich!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I've had the falafel wrap for a vegan option. I am never sure with the sauces, but I believe it was just a tahini sauce.
Nice and relaxing place, self service for ordering, water with lemon for free.
Nice place to grab a quick bite."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Lots of healthy food choices, great salads, vegetarian and omnivore options.  I usually have the ""natural salad"" with a side of grilled chicken to tide me over.  Sometimes the chicken is a little dry, but either way, its pretty good.  

The service is very friendly, you rarely have to wait  long for your food and there are a lot of choices on the menu.  Also, this place wont burn a hole in your wallet."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Stopped by State Street before dropping off my sister at UCSB. Looking for something light to eat, she suggested this place.

Atmosphere: Very casual with lots of seating. Order at the front, get your own utensils, and they deliver the food to you.

Food: I ordered the Pasta Special, which was filled with vegetables and came with garlic bread. Although the vegetables were fresh and delicious, the pasta was overall lacking in flavor. Luckily, the price is decent. To be honest, it was nothing really memorable. 

Maybe in the future I'd be willing to try some other menu items."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Loved eating here as opposed to having your typical bar food.  The food here was so healthy and tasty.  My husband and I loved it and will definitely be back.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Okay I try not to give a full 5 stars if I've only been somewhere once- but this little cafe definitely deserves it. 

The patio is dog friendly and when I walked up with my puppy, a really nice blonde girl found me a table and waited near it to save it for me! 

The food was SO FRESH. The salmon is wild caught and served with whole grain rice and a side salad. Great portion sizes too! My mom opted for the ranch salad which she was surprisingly impressed with (double points because she's a picky eater) 

To top it off- I went inside to ask for a small to go cup for water and I had two very nice young men ask what it was for and how they could help. 

A+ for service and food here!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"HUGE FAN.  I currently live in Chicago, and do not let a visit go by in CA without coming up to SB and grabbing some good yums at the Natural.

I came upon it a few years ago when I lived down the street, and made it a frequent stop before I moved.  I used to bring my books and study for hours, and no one ever bothered me.  Now, I think I have dragged all of my non local friends to this place at least once.  

I have only been to two of the locations (State St and the one in San Luis Obispo), but I would like to eventually check out the others.

Highly recommend the veg chili with corn bread (had this like 3 weeks ago), the kids pb and honey sandwich, grilled chicken pita, roasted turkey sand, and last but never the least, the peanut butter vanilla shake.  To die for."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Charming little restaurant/ cafe  .  Ordered the chicken pita and the old town salad 

The chicken in the pita was REALLY GOOD CHICKEN. Extremely tasty.  The corn chips that accompanied them were crisp and I just wanted to keep eating more and more 

The salad was fresh and visually appealing.  The ingredients were fresh and yummy 

For a place to grab a quick eat while walking down State street this is the place to go to."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"It is what it is. You feel good for eating there, but nothing but the soups are that noteworthy. Soups can miss, but can be so perfect sometimes.

This is a great location, people-wise. Very open and airy too. I like sitting outside on a lazy afternoon with a gf and nothing to do but enjoy the air and feel that SB-zen.

I like the spinach and old town salads, with side of chicken. Avoid the veggie burrito...flavorless. I'll also second what someone said on the guac.

Can take forever to get food though when bz"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The Santa Barbara Independent named their veggie burger 'the best' in 2013. On their menu they have 3 non-meat burger options. Since the article did not specify which veggie burger was 'the best', I went with the cashiers recommendation and ordered the Zen Burger. 

The Zen Burger was a good choice. Unlike many veggie burgers, this one did not fall apart after the first bite. I also liked the garlic mayo and sprouts that topped the patty. I have tried a number of veggie burgers named 'the best' and I've yet to find an unequivocal standout, but the Zen Burger has a good hold on one of the top spots. 

In addition to the burger, I also had the grilled vegetable salad with the Lemon Vinegarette. The full size was generously portioned and therefore very filling. 

Natural Cafe has several locations throughout the Central Coast and if given the chance I'll be back to try more of their menu."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"So good. And really cute. I had the portabella sandwich, which was delicious. I also had the veggie chili which was good but not the best I've ever had. Lastly. I got the grande nachos for the table to share. 

A couple of caveats. I had asked for the sour cream to be given on the side because one friend is lactose intolerant. Nope, it's right there in the middle. I had also asked for the onions on the side and they were throughout the dish. I personally do not care, because I'm not that picky about my food, but my friend requested this and they could not get it right.

Lastly, the bathroom requires tokens. A pin on the ass because if the bathroom is occupied, you won't know until you've already put your token in. So there you go, back again to get another token.

I will be back to this place. I highly recommend it for lunch."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I love natural cafe. When I lived in Santa Barbara this place was a staple for me and I wish every city had one because I miss it. It's delicious, quality food, served quickly, at a reasonable price. Although I like all of their locations, this one on State Street is my favorite because of the outdoor patio. It's a great place to people watch. Also you can bring your dog if you eat on the patio. 

My personal favorites are the salads (great dressing) and the 1/2 sandwich and soup combos (because I get to have more than one thing and not completely gorge myself). I really don't think you can go wrong here. As noted by many others there are a lot of great vegetarian options. Natural Cafe is a great place to come with a group of vegetarians and carnivores, because they also have excellent chicken dishes so there really is something for everyone and no one is left eating something awful.

If you are a SB local I'm sure you have been here so if you are a tourist I highly recommend coming here for lunch while enjoying the day on State Street."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,This place is so easy to find on state street and great variety offered. Got black bean enchilladas (cheese) and it was great. The food is on the bland side and americanized. The portions are huge. The milkshakes and smoothies are delicious and again large. You can easily share a plate if your not too hungry. The milkshakes can be made vegan and soy-based. Would recommend this for anyone who is vegetarian or have a picky group. Can't wait to eat here again!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Best in town for clean food choices and prices!  Hope they never leave!  We eat here every time we visit.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Love this place! You have to really be in the mood for something healthy and light but if u are this place is a great option. Their soups are great and their portabella sandwich is Freeking epic. Hippy never tasted so good :)
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Old town salad and the Mt. Fuji stir fry are the bomb, they have great smoothies too"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Great place, had the albacore natural salad and a cup of butternut squash soup. The portion size was very generous with a big scoop of delicious tuna on top. Great ambiance. The only problem is you had to walk all the way to the back to pay and place your order before sitting down."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Got the tostada salad. Portion sizes were huge, actual brown rice, and tasted fresh. Loved it"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"If I had to pick a restaurant that would define California for me, this would be it. Avocados, fresh ingredients, healthy and healthy-ish food that you don't have to make yourself!

Definitely decent food. But a little overpriced for what it is.

I go to the location in Goleta frequently. Their baja burrito is pretty good; their sandwiches and soups are too.
Their lemon herb dressing, now that's something to talk about, I could eat gallons."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"It was a random choice as my friend and I strolled State street trying to decide what to eat. It's nice to see a place like this among so many seemingly tourist-trap restaurants. 
I got the chicken pita. It was loaded with chicken strips and greens and chips and salsa on the side.
Prices are very reasonable, portions are hearty, overall a wonderful place to dine. Lots of veggie options, guilt free dining. Just don't be psychotic like the lady behind us who only ordered a bowl of lettuce. Sigh. Doesn't she know that salt and pepper don't have that many calories and can really spice up a meal?
The salad dressing was so delicious that some lady was holding up the counter begging for the recipe, but they couldn't give it to her."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I enjoy this place, very healthy food at reasonable price. They have brown rice, and all the nice things vegetarian types like. I find their mexican menu flavorless, but I enjoy most of the other menu here. I eat here a lot, and I wish they were up in NoCal."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"If your order a burrito, especially in California, would you expect there to be sauce on it? No, right? That would usually make it an enchilada wouldn't it? 

And if chips and salsa is on the menu as a side, and you order something like a burrito, you'd expect to get chips and salsa instead of a salad right?

This place confuses me.

The burrito was delicious and the chips and salsa (that i had to order separately) were also really good; but I'm a bigger fan of things making sense."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Such a great place find for a health foodie like me. The fish tacos were so flavorful. We had a wonderful trip to Santa Barbara and having lunch here made it extra special. Definitely coming back on our next visit.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,I had the Steamed Veggies over brown rice and sauteed tofu.  This dish was a pretty big portion but I think the taste overall could be improved. It was pretty bland and the vegetables were undercooked.  BF got the grilled chicken pita sandwich and that was pretty delicious.  Overall this place was fairly priced and a good atmosphere for a simple lunch.  I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu but I don't think I'll order their veggies and rice dishes again.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The food and the atmosphere were very good, with reasonable prices and friendly staff.
In addition to the food, I'd like to acknowledge appreciation for the manager. My husband and I were only passing through Santa Barbara while traveling and left a Macy's bag underneath our table. Three hours later on the road we realized it, called the restaurant back up and spoke to the manager. He was very nice and immediately said he'd be happy to ship our bag to us. Three days later it was delivered via UPS and we weren't even charged anything."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I used to eat here all of the time when I lived in Santa Barbara.  As a vegan, it was one of my only options in town.  I returned yesterday for some shopping and stopped in here once again.  The falafel sandwich was incredible.  It was the first time I had it, and the checkout girl ensured me it was vegan.  It had a sweet tangy sauce mixed in with the tahini, some kind of sesame ginger, it was SO good.  My husband (a vegetarian) had the mushroom sandwich and loved it.  We also shared some guacamole and chips- the guacamole was too cold (pre-made, refridgerated) and we like ours room temp and fresh, and came with WAY too many chips- not to mention our entrees came with chips and salsa!  We seriously had a whole bag of chips spilling all over our table, haha...  Oh well, now I know!  This place is awesome if you are a vegetarian or like to eat healthy/light fare.  My only gripe is that I wish they marked stuff that was vegan or that could easily be made veganizable.  That would give this five stars in my opinion.

Oh- and rumor has it that Depeche Mode likes to eat here when they are in town.  SOOO cool."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"It's casual, nice, and the food is amazing. It's also really healthy!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Yum yum yum... Chicken tacos with brown rice and pinto beans, simple but amazingly yummy. Huge salads, quality great veggies. Love this place. Great location and atmosphere."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,I was excited to find a place that offers vegan options but I think we ordered the wrong thing. We got the tempeh tacos and the sauce was very bland. It tasted like canned tomato sauce with no spice or seasoning. The salsa that was served with the chips would have been a better dressing. Overall it was disappointing. I'm offering the stars for the service. The staff was very friendly!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Why don't we have these all over the place in the bay area?  I ate here twice and another time at the one in SLO while on vacation.  I love it.  The food is relatively affordable for what it is.  It is vegi friendly and vegan capable.  It is nice and woody, but the food is far above what I expected given the setup and prices.

I also have to say, they make great vegi sandwiches.  I don't say this lightly as you would be surprised at how hard it is to make a vegetarian sandwich worth eating.  They do it."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I've eaten here about 10 times in the past few months. I have never had a bad meal. I love the BREAD that comes with their soup and salad... SUPER nutty and amazing. 

One tip, their soups do have quite a bit of cream, so be cautious if you're lactose intolerant (like me).

Why not 5? Because it's loud as crap... and not good for large groups."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,Nice sidewalk patio. Big order here sign. Plenty of veggie options. Only bottled beer but it includes some locals. Falafel and chili.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,A usual stop in downtown Santa Barbara for lunch. Hubby had the tamale. Very good. I had a baked potato. Will come again next time we're in town.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Was in town for a weekend getaway and I got the tempeh veggie burger and my bf got the gobbler burger. We were both 100% satisfied with our choices! Their salsa is delicious and love that they have vegan options! Drink selections are amazing.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Awesome dish for anyone who loves veggies! I added chicken and my friend added tofu! Another customer saw what we were eating and came over to asked what is was so she could order it too!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I just don't get it.  Everyone raves about this place but it just isn't anything special.  Its not that the food is bad.  It is fresh and healthy.  But pretty much everything I've ever had there is just bland.  My buddy - whom I trust - keeps telling me I have to get the turkey burger, so I'll give it one more shot with that.  But otherwise I really don't see any reason to select the 'Natch.  You want great sandwiches?  Hit Panino or 3 Pickles.  Want tasty pasta?  Hit up Pascucci.  Local organics and salads?  Sojourner."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Tasty, fresh and healthy food at a very very good price given the extremely generous portion sizes!!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Triple T-Tasty!  If you must have red meat in every meal, then this is not the place for you.  Turkey burgers-phenomenal!  Pesto pasta, a must-try.  I'm not kidding,everything here is amazing.  I've probably eaten here more than 20 times in my four years in SB.  The Yogi Special is great for all the vegetarians.

The Lisa Felini is the best smoothy!  

I'm also a fan of all the salads that are on the menu.  I also enjoyed the tuna sandwich, but my least favorite was the turkey breast sandwich; it was too dry and bland."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I eat here a lot & the food is consistently good. They often seem understaffed, undertrained & overwhelmed. It seems 1/4 of the time I order something, they try to hand me something different. I ask for a wet rag & clean my own table almost always. Beware, sometimes they refuse service before their advertised hours say closed. All in all a good lunch spot with a nice patio in the sun."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,a multitude of great veggie options at reasonable prices.  The enchiladas were delicious--black beans and brown rice have never tasted so good. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Great view of State street and perfect for people watching. The carrot juice and falafel pita were delicious.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I start my drive go Santa Barbara from Pasadena thinking, hey, a salad from The Natural sounds nice. I'm not THAT hungrey, after all I just had my fav hard boiled egg with ketchup. One hour later: well maybe ill get a sandwhich at The Natural, it'll come with a salad. Two hours later in the parking lot by that weird Indian Bazaar: Roarrrr, black bean enchilladas with extra cheese, guac and sour cream.

You get the idea. For a place to sell healthy eats that actually keep you full for more than 3 minutes, this place defo does the job.

Top picks: tahini dressing, black bean enchiladas, tempeh tacos, breads, soups, and oh yeah HonesT. HonesT has supernatural thirst quenching power, I'm convinced of this."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Good place to bring your vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends.  Mushroom burger is delicious with a veggie patty that tastes like real burger. . Salsa is amazing
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Picked up take out and the service was fast and lovely. Food was absolutely spectacular. Veggie lasagna was delicious. Fresh, natural, can't wait to try more items on the menu!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"Delicious organic and healthy ""fast food""! Its a tall order but the natural cafe really serves it up right. My only qualm is that I do wish it was a place where you get waited on more, but thats really just personal preference. Great outdoor seating area and the veggie burger with garlic mayo was to die for. I was expecting more of the cornbread and honey butter, but it satisfied my corn bread craving. On vacation driving up the PCH it was nice to have something that was more healthful after days of eating :)"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,In college I use to think that the prices were expensive. Now that I make a decent buck - I return. The smoothies are super fresh - I recall a peachy one I love. Share a nice round of guac and chips after a roundabout walk on State Street.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"This place is great! Husband and 2 year old came here before our visit to the SB Zoo during our coastal road trip to San Francisco. It was about noon on a Wednesday and parking wasn't crazy nor was the place crowded. We were looking for a good lunch spot in downtown Santa Barbara and prior Yelpers did not disappoint! 

The food was yummy! We had the Turkey Burger and half salad along with a kids pizza for my daughter. The total was about $18 and some change. I'm not a beef or pork eater so turkey burgers are important to me. And usually when you get a turkey burger from a place like this, it's a lot smaller than a beef burger (according to my husband the red meat eater). The burger was about the same size (plus) and it was fresh and satisfying. The bread was super fresh too! The ceasar salad came with avocado which is great for me since I love them. Overall, a great place and great experience. Highly recommended."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The chicken enchilada is to die for. My Tip is to be nice to the staff, I hear if you aren't they spit in you're food....  Watch out!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I really love the Natural Café! Im not a vegetarian or vegan or anything like that but I think it certainly provides a great selection to people with special preferences. That aside, the food is wonderful! So tasty and fresh! I love the tuna melt, the chicken tacos and the salad with the Tahini dressing! So easy to order lunch too, I just call a few minutes ahead and pick it right up.  You can even have a beer with your lunch while you eat and people watch."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I always love eating here. It seems less and less easy to get a green, simple, fresh delicious salad anywhere except here. Everything they serve is delicious and fresh. How wonderful to have a gluten-free, vegan diet and find such a large choice of dishes. They are not strictly vegetarian, so there is something for everyone. I recommend particularly the tostada salad."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"It doesn't get much easier to eat vegetarian than when you're in Santa Barbara, so I hope people don't visit the Natural Cafe and think this is what ""vegetarian food"" has to be.  This is 70s style hippie food in a 70s style hippie setting.  Reminds me of Venice Beach, 1977.  

My husband LOVES food like this.  Sprouts on EVERYTHING (I didn't think to specify ""no sprouts"" on my HUMMUS and it was too late because we got our order to-go.)  

Also the bathrooms are a serious factor in my 2 star rating.  While the table seating area feels decently clean, the bathroom we visited (one of two) was GROSS.  My four year old (not known to be the pickiest when it comes to sanitation) claimed it smelled like ""rotten raisins and bananas.""  

Why, why, why is there a URINAL in an individual, locking bathroom?  And WHY was it so dirty, but on top of being dirty, WHY was it filled with ice?  My husband claims many urinals, including in ""the best places,"" are frequently filled with ice, because ""they have to dump the ice somewhere.""  

No, no, no.  That is just so wrong.  I don't even want to imagine kitchen workers bringing food service materials into this bathroom then going back to the kitchen with them.  

Also you need a token.  Why require a token?  How could letting the non-paying public in actually make it worse?

Now on to the food....mediocre, covered in sprouts.  Wasn't terrible, but nothing to write home about.  In their favor the variety on the menu is huge, with a lot of meat analogues (fake meat) if that's your thing.  Prices are very reasonable.

Bottom line for me is that if you're already on State Street, there are a dozen other restaurants where a vegetarian could eat so much better."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I was taken here for a free lunch so I can't complain too much. I'm not a vegetarian or health-nut, so most of the menu was unappealing to me. I had the eggplant sandwich and carrot juice. Both were good, but a bit overpriced. The outdoor seating was very close to the busy road and in direct sunlight."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Looking at the name,one might thing its one of those Raw food places or the Vegan ones or the whole vegetarian spots.But they are just a good combination of all the above +meat lovers food,and trust me the food is fine,i can't say the food is mind blowing coming from the RAW heaven of Santa Monica,CA.

   The place is pretty well-spaced and has the booth like seating on the sides and also a cute outdoor patio.A place which is pretty simple and easy to dive into the comfort mode.We ordered the Quesadilla appetizers,a spiritual spinach salad,Chicken entree,Grilled vegetables and a burrito.The salad was HUGE!!,served in a bamboo bowl filled with spinach,sprouts,carrots,tofu and bits of vegan chicken and a drizzle of almonds made my tummy happy.My friends did enjoy every bite of their food as they expressed ""This is definitely one of the best healthy things i've had ""

  And we also did get the chocolate milkshakes which was pretttyyy good :)
Natural cafe- is a great place to revitalize yourself and make your tummy happy the natural way :)

lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I didn't think I liked peanut-butter milkshakes (sacrilege, I know) until visiting Natural Cafe with a friend last weekend, who vouched for the reliability of the place. A few nibbles of her portabello mushroom sandwich, coupled with the vast Natural Platter (feat. beans, rice, cornbread, cheddar cheese, and the list goes on...), had me hooked. Amid Santa Barbara's humdrum chain stores disguised in Spanish-style architecture, this was a true gem, with its airy atmosphere and high ceilings. With so many things to try on the menu, I'll have to make a return trip someday."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,We were in line for Italian across the street and saw this place from a short distance. The line was short so we went in and ordered some unbelievable food. The service was excellent along with  the ambiance!
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Stopped in for lunch from solid Yelp reviews . Didn't disappoint had mushroom turkey burger . So moist and delicious... staff were so sweet and friendly. It was really good !
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Healthy, tasty americanized mexican food. Organic veggies , tasty fish made our veggie quesedia nd fish tacos..taste good.

If you are looking for non greasy option in state street natural cafe is the place."

Grilled veggie salad , yum....add chicken ....yummier , a bit too much food but  you can share it with someone you love . 
Food is  always fresh and flavorful, tasty  dressings etc. so on and so forth. 
Try it , there are many choices and im batting a  ten out of 10 on their menu ! mmm mmm good !"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Really good food. Not to expensive. The food is high quality and made with a healthy conscience mind! A go-to lunch stop for me when I get down here to SB.  Food is yummy. It's really easy to get in, get an order  in and grab a table. It has a nice open air ambiance. For the architectural types/ the front windows that look out onto State street are magnificent!!!"

The food is great and affordable, especially for SB.

Lunch, dinner, take-out... you'll be happy no matter what.

My personal fave: The Old Town Salad"

Prices also quite affordable. I will come again. Seating arrangements also very convenient. Staff always smiling and helpful."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"not a fan of healthy food and this place isn't my favorite place to go to, but if i had to go here, i'd get the portobello mushroom sandwich. it's decent. oh, and it's located right next to Cold Stone Creamery yessssss"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,negative,"I order from the natural café Hitchcock location frequently and have never had any issues. I recently ordered form the state street location and had a horrible experience. We called in an order of 2 old town salads(my usual order) to take home. when I stared to eat my salad i got, not just a strand of hair but a clump of hair, as if some one brushed their hair over my salad. I was repulsed and had to call them back about my finding. The girl on the other end of the phone was apologetic and offered to replace it. I agreed to drive back and have them make me a fresh one without the hair. I went to go pick up my new salad and the girl behind the counter had attitude about how it couldn't be hair,"" It must be one of the brushes we use to clean the grill or its a towel"" regardless of if its hair or not, don't make an excuse and give an attitude to a customer who found something in their food that should not have been there."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Excellent pinto beans & rice with tahini sauce. Lots of vegetarian choices. Great patio.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"The natural cafe rocks whether you are vegetarian or not! I, being veggie, could not be more satisfied. I love their grilled eggplant sandwiches, yum!
And for dessert l really like their carrot milkshake made with fresh carrot juice!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I've been meaning to write a review of The Natural Cafe for awhile now. My mom and I roadtripped to SB about 5 or 6 years ago and she introduced me to this healthy, vegetarian-friendly joint. I still remember my order: the kid's PB & Honey Sandwich with a Very Berry Smoothie. Yummm! I've since visited the Natural Cafe half a dozen times, give or take and every piece of food has been so delicious. I've eaten their wraps, their salads, and their vegetarian chili, which is actually my favorite! The vibe of the people who work here is nothing less than laid-back stellar. Every time I find myself in downtown Santa Barbara, I make sure to find a table and enjoy some good grub."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Great healthy food and kid friendly! My four little ones usually opt for the chicken encheladas
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,Good food and a nice location we sat outside and soaked up the sun on the patio. Food was really fresh and served in the perfect portion size.
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Oh yum! I'm not an expert when it comes to vegetarian cuisine but the Zen burger was really good! Not like the greasy veggie burgers that you get at bars or the frozen hockey pucks you get from the grocery store. 

We also had the Greek salad which was super fresh and tasty. 

An A in my book!"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Pretty tasty and not very expensive! Some of their food on the menu is sort of heavy but they have plenty of salads and many choices so pretty much anyone can find something they like. 
The food is not outstanding but if you are looking for a quick and cheap vegetarian meal natural cafe will be there for you. The produce does seem very fresh however I wish their smoothies were natural and less sweet."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Ventured up to Santa Barbara this past weekend for a break from the Los Angeles pace. First stop: lunch. 

I've been on a veggie kick lately, so when I stumbled across the reviews for The Natural Cafe, I knew I had to try it. 

Right away, the place was lovely. Very open with a lot of natural light. They also had a fairly large patio area out front. When you go in, head towards to counter in the back. That's where you'll place your order.

I tried the Old Town Salad. Reading what was in the salad, I was a little thrown. Carrots, tomato, feta cheese, short grain brown rice, and guacamole. What the? Trust me, it was amazing! Fresh, a little unusual, and light enough for enjoy the rest of my day exploring. 

Boyfriend had the Ranchero Chicken Quesadilla, which he kept raving about. 

Nice peeps, good eats."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Good and fresh.  tasty.  Seems like they turn over staff fairly often, so menu knowledge and service is inconsistent.  I go there at least once a week."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"I had the lunch special: roasted veggie enchiladas that was amazing.  The server, Jennifer was very kind and accommodating while serving me on the patio with my doggie."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Always one of my favorite places in Santa Barbara to eat, I love the atmosphere and the people, they make incredible food at a reasonable price do yourself a favor and give it a try, you will not be disappointed !"
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Simple, casual and allows dogs on their patio.
Had the veggie chili and it was well worth the economical price.  It's a back to basics food affair... have to say I'm glad for it."
lu2UpRHLBZfvLG_caNEHKQ,The Natural Cafe,Mexican,positive,"Natural Cafe is the best. It's definitely a staple for Santa Barbara locals. The food is fresh, well prepared, and they have tons of healthy options. I love the Old Town Salad with grilled Chicken, the Chicken Tacos, Veggie Stir Fry and Zen Burger. Also, get the Tahini Dressing on EVERYTHING. 

There's a lot behind the restaurant that's free parking for 75 minutes. There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.
It gets busy at lunch, but it's easy to call ahead and get your food to go! I order it for my family all the time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This restaurant has a special place in my heart since my family and I used to trek up from Los Angeles for their stellar tacos, tamales, and gorditas. This most recent visit was an excellent reminder of why we stopped going to great lengths to include la superrica in our lives. We waited 45 minutes to order even though there were only about 10 parties ahead of us and then proceeded to wait another 45-50 minutes for our food. There is something endearing and eclectic about the line out the door, but they were just slow on this particular Friday @ 4pm. 

The food is worth one of the waits, the prices are mediocre. I order three tacos and a gordita normally and commend their beef dishes over the pork. Just make sure to set expectations to slow."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love La-Superica! I highly recommend getting their specials if you go - just getting a taco on the regular menu will not amaze you. What's so great on their rotating specials menus is the Sopes on Tuesday, the Enchiladas on Thursday, and if you aren't allergic to shellfish, the seafood tamales on the weekend (can't remember when I saw that).  Skip the #13 which is a chile cheese dip...   We love the dive atmosphere, the homemade tortillas, and the tradition of standing in line like it's the Soup Nazi's kitchen.  Enjoy!  It's not typical Mexican food - they use french influenced techniques using cream...yum!  But like I said, you'll find this in their SPECIALS menu - you won't be disappointed with those!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Went the first time to pay homage to Julia. Second time realized it's not that great. Lousy salsas, OK food. Won't go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This little hole in the wall taqueria is written about in all the travel magazines.  I'm no connoiseur of Mexican food but it was the most authentic I've had in SB. Need a car to get to.  Some may say it's overrated...but when a little shack receives so much publicity...aren't you a little curious?
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Probably the best place to eat in Santa Barbara. The hand made tortillas are to die for. There Guacamole never smells funky, its always fresh. Everything on their menu is amazing! The only down side is the LONG line. however it is well worth the wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I read a Newspaper review by a Professional once who said he didn't understand how a restaurant could have lousy food and yet have people hanging out the doors for years...the only thing he could figure out was that some places people were just comfortable going to???

WELL that is La Super Rica!!!  We read reviews of this place a long time ago and started going up from Woodland Hills...our family would stop in every time we visited Santa Barbara. I don't know what changed but there's NO WAY any of us returns here again!!!
Yesterday we all took the trip up there and stopped by for the first time in years.......just after lunch time...5 of us ordered the regular beef tacos, quesadillas and some other stuff. 
Everything arrived on these 3 or 4 inch TINY tortillas.....The Beef Tacos consisted of 2 tablespoons of dry tough beef on 2 tortillas AND NOTHING ELSE on it..no cabbage, parsley, lettuce, sauce NOTHING????....they have a small condiment bar...just hot sauce & salsa...we tried that  but they were all terrible....hardly edible!!!  The Quesadilla's were melted cheese on the same tiny tortillas. The other dishes were also very underwhelming!!!
It wasn't that it was just bad & dry...there was nothing to the food...it felt like a major rip-off!!!

We left ... looking for someplace else we could get a good burger!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I live near San Diego and this is worth the drive if you're even passing by.  If u want traditional mexican food without a passport.... expect great food, a long line & nothing fancy...."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I wish I was able to eat more... or eat here more often!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It's good and super fresh, but over-rated. I can think of ten places that are better, but it's a staple so why not.

I gave an extra star for the super friendly owner and staff."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,My absolute favorite Mexican food in Santa Barbara. Be ready to wait a long time ! It's a small order window with seating in the back. They food is so fresh and everything is good. I try to come at least once a week!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The only place to go for Mexican food in the Santa Barbara area. Worth the wait if their is a line, and there will be a line!!! Get lots of plates and share. The Cheese and tomatoe ""soup"" is a family favorite. Their homemade chorizo is excellent. Tortillas made fresh in front of you and better than Grandma ever made (sorry Grandma). Cant say enough good things about this little place. A must go to!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is more out of the way than the usual food places but well worth the trip. Lots of options, my favorite was actually the chicken suizos, which I cannot find at any other mexican restaurant. Especial was good also with the variety of sauces. Handmade tortillas were a highlight. 
It was also on Guy Fieri's show for anyone that didn't know."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"5/5 stars! As people say there is a long wait, about 30-40 minutes, limited street parking, and it's cash only. We got a few different items #16 pork melted cheese and peppers,  marinated beef taco, marinated pork taco, guacamole taco, and chile con queso to name a few. The corn tortillas are especially good- soft and fresh you can tell there are only a few ingredients in the food here and that's what makes it so good. You can tell the kitchen has been cooking this way for a long time. The special vegetarian tamale with sauce on top is great, it has corn and melted cheese inside. For the simple fresh ingredients, old school service La Super rica is a great spot in SB."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"An extremely long line is sometimes a good thing. 

I had heard about this place for a couple of years before we were able to make it here. On a recent trip to the central coast, we stopped by and I braved the line while my husband waited in the car with our sleeping child. 

The chile stuffed with cheese and marinated pork sounded pretty much like the best thing ever and, as it was a house specialty, we were all in. It was pretty good and we did enjoy it. A bit blander than I would have thought, but still, a tasty and unique item. I can't say it merited an hour long wait, but it was most certainly above average. Nice homemade tortillas too and a cute patio for those eating in."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,The tacos are worth the drive from Oxnard to Santa Barbara. Would give them a 5but they just need to do something about the flies. Uncomfortable sometimes.  Katie Perry had it on spot when she mentioned them in her song
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Came here at the request of some friends, always heard good things. Long wait in line, but the wait was worth it. The tacos are good, but one special was what would bring me back. The enchilada in cream sauce calls me back. The tamale was good but didn't compare to how much my taste buds like the sauce combined with the enchilada. Nothing is bad here, it all depends on what you are in the mood for."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I think they have the best tamales I have ever tasted!  There was a long line out the door of this little shack, and the line doesn't move very fast, but it was worth the wait!  I had tri-tip tacos, porks tacos, and a tamale.  Yum!!  It is no surprise to me that Julia Child loved this place when she was alive."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My favorite Mexican place on Earth. Homemade FRESH salsas and tortillas. My favorite is #12, Pechuga Suiza, basically a chicken quesadilla. SO good. I've been coming here since I was a toddler and my whole family loves it. Sure the line can get kinda long sometimes but it's always worth the wait for hot fresh Mexican. Had the special tamales last time, and they were great!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A number of years ago none other than Julia Child called La Super Rica her favorite place to eat. Almost immediately with that as the ultimate endorsement ringing in our ears, my sister and i figured we had to check out  this food.
And Miss Julia was right: the Beef ( i always have problems with the beef at Taquerias) was moist and most importantly was not cut up like kibble something i particularly dislike.
No the beef was moist and cut in strips. we were impressed. In the intervening years i have been to La Super many times with varying results of success and failure all across the menu board.
These ups and downs are a natural thing when you frequent a place for over 20 years.
Obviously all of the ""misses"" were nothing that could keep me away because the 'hits"" far outnumbered them.
Last week i hit the 101 on a Trader Joe's run (i like the Milpas store the best) and thought to myself: ""hey let's check out the special tamale i have been hearing about at La Super!"" And so i did.
The Tamal of the day was Plantain Chicken. the flavor of the plantain leaves (the wrap) permeated the masa. chicken and other bits of filling in a way that was slightly sweet yet  full of savory goodness: surprisingly plantains and chicken meld perfectly. You cannot produce this flavor dispersion from wrap to filling when a dried corn husk is used. i could have had another 1 or 2.
I also ordered a couple tacos: Adobado and of course, Bistek. Several cultures have Adobado, the Philippine for one and yet i prefer the Mexican variety made here because of the red chili used in the mix: i think the New Mexico variety which is full of flavor and heat.
The Bistek was as i remembered it: sliced, moist, tasting slightly of char and when adorned with guacamole and salsa and cut onions is pretty terrific.
Wash all that down with a super cold Bohemia and i am in La Super Rica heaven.
I have to be honest : this is not always the case here but somehow La Super always pulls it out the next time i come in.
This was a well spent early afternoon in East SB. Yes, it was."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I must be living a charmed life.  Everything on my recent SB trip went so right.  Including my visit to La Super Rica.  Hubby and I popped in on a cloudy Monday afternoon for a late lunch and there was NO LINE!!  I mean NO line.  We parked the car with no problem, walked right up to the counter and placed our order.  And then we chose a table from among several vacant ones.  Maybe there's something to be said for not traveling during prime tourist season.  And eating lunch late.  On a Monday.

I had the  #16 Super Rica Especial - roasted chile with cheese and pork on corn tortillas.  It doesn't sound like much, but each ingredient on its own is top-notch.  The melding of them together was heaven.  And the homemade tortillas didn't hurt any either.  This place is definitely worth trying.  I'd go again even if I did have to stand in line!

You folks that live in SB are so lucky (sigh...)."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Amazing!!! Julia Childs nailed it! A must wait in line & eat here! Have been here more than once! I think I have had a bite of everything. Not a fancy place, unremarkable space, a place to eat! The tamale is amazing! You want to order everything! They do have beer & wine! Family friendly!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is a great little place in Santa Barbara. We arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened and people were already lined up to order.

The food was delicious and very affordable. I had the Alambre de Filette and Pozole ad both were good. 

There were so many people eating at the restaurant by the time we left, people were standing around waiting for open tables and for people to leave.

I would definitely visit this place again when I visit Santa Barbara"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I wanted to find something for lunch in Santa Barbara and this place came up on yelp.  It was real crowded but worth the wait.  We had the Number 16 super rica especial number and number 8 tamale norte.  The tamale was probably the best I ever had, it had tomato sauce and real light.  The tortillas are made fresh there, very reasonable prices.  Excellent food, very different from other Mexican places I have been to"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My mom kept mentioning this place, so my boyfriend and I finally decided to try it in one of our visits to Santa Barbara. Oh boy, food was delicious. Tacos with homemade tortillas were just out of this world. I should listen to my mother more often when it comes to food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I'm sorry to say that I wasn't blown away. We over ordered so we could experience a variety of things. Some were winners and others not so much. 

The shredded beef tacos were a hit, especially with the avocado crema. The 11 was also delicious. The cheese was melty...and tortillas were so amazing. I really didn't like the 14 because I didn't like the chorizo. There were tough chunks of fat in it that I couldn't eat. I also had the pinto beans (19) and they were good. 

My husband had 7, 10, & 16. He didn't like the tri-tip in the 7. It was tough and dry. He really enjoyed the 10...he likes that chorizo. And he loved that it was grilled and crunchy. The 16 was his favorite. He enjoyed the pork, pepper and of course melted cheese. 

It was a fun experience, but I was expecting better."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"must-have:
-chorizo quesadilla
-guacamole
-chorizo y queso liquid yumness

avoid:
-chicken and bell pepper

was much, much better than i expected given the mixed reviews!"

I have been trying to drag the husband here for years.  Long lines, closed, never made it in until today.  Ordered a few of our usual faves (carne asada, tamale) and were not really impressed.  I think the strength of this place is their vegetarian dishes.  Tacos de Hongo blew me away.  Vegetable Chile Relleno was great.  But if you are looking for a top-rate Taqueria that has animal protein, this may not be the place.

Also, the corn tortillas were fantastic.  I'll return with my vegetarian friends perhaps, but not the husband.   He judges a place by their carne asada and this didn't do it for us."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Cheap and delicious. Homemade tortillas are so good, made right before your eyes. The guy taking my order was so nice! Lots of places to sit. Very casual atmosphere."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Went for some tacos after a little picnic at Shoreline Park.  My friend is craving for one and searched on YELP and perfect.  Few blocks away from downtown and luckily just 5 people are ahead of us in line.  

Had the steak quesadilla and went on round two.  Pico de gallo is fantastic.  Hope to be back here.

Yummy yummy..."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The food is PHENOMENAL!!!!  There was a line of course, but it was so worth it!  I ordered the chili relleno (best I've ever had).  The chile relleno literally tasted like meat.  I also ordered #1, #16 and #19.  #16 was cheesy goodness!   My friend got the posole and it was the best posole I've ever had.  The man who took our order greeted us with a smile.  He was very friendly.  I'm sad that I live 2 hours away, but I guess it's a good thing, bc if it was closer, I'd be there all the time!  Oh and make sure you tip them!!  A couple in front of me ordered like $40 worth of food and didn't even leave any money in their tip jar... so tacky!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Wow. This place was the highlight of our trip to Santa Barbara! We stopped by for tacos our first night in town and then headed back over twice more during our short weekend visit. 

The ingredients are fresh, the tortillas are made by hand AS YOU ORDER THEM, and the beers are icy cold and handed to you with a fresh slice of lime. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back now. The prices are super reasonable (cheap even) and the only bummer is that the word is out on this place and there is nearly always a line around the corner. Try to get there when they first open or at ""odd eating hours"" to get in fastest. 

There's a lot of seating in the back, and the churn is pretty high so you don't get stuck without a place to sit. That said, we also took our food to go one night and it tasted just as good when we got it back to the hotel.

Locals and tourists alike gravitate to this place. That makes it a winner in my book.

Delish!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,La superica especial.. that is all.. I don't live in SB but I make it a point to come every time I'm in town! It's that worth it!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Uhhhh what?  Ok, so it's not the worst Mexican food I've ever had, but my experience did not live up to the hype at all.  Maybe we came on an off night, but there was barely a line and the dingy dining area was almost empty.  The food was totally underwhelming--too much low-quality, gummy cheese smothered on top of everything, and the meat (chicken and pork) was bland and had a lot of rubbery bits in it.  The guacamole and salsas were pretty much flavorless and watery.  Even the horchata sucked.  How can you f*ck up horchata?!  It was way too sweet in that corn syrupy way that it made my teeth hurt.  The only thing I really liked were the tortillas, which, unlike the rest of the food, actually tasted fresh and made to order.   I don't even want to get into the whole issue of what's considered ""authentic"" and/or ""regional,"" it was just simply poorly prepared food.  I'd be embarrassed to take anyone here, unless it's that 70 year old great-aunt who ""doesn't like ethnic food because it's always too spicy."""
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"There is always a line for this authentic Mexican restaurant, but it's worth the wait.  You won't find a great ambience, but the food makes up for it.  I had their chile relleno with cheese which I had read was highly recommended.  They weren't kidding!!  It's the best that I've tasted.  My husband had the chicken and vegetable, #8, and it was also excellent!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I didn't think much about this place when I drove past it to look for parking, except that it was a little strange to see a huge line wrapped around a shack. The wait was pretty long and I was getting restless wondering why I have to wait in such a long line for Mexican food. And I also wanted my chicken mole. Well, it turns out that they don't serve chicken mole. I was bummed until I had my first bite of their food (for me, it was the chicken quesadilla), and then I forgot all about the mole. It was delicious! The tortilla was the best that I've ever had in my life, by far. I wasn't too fond of their tacos, because the meat was just okay, but I couldn't get over the tortillas. Friend loved the #14 chorizo especial. It was a lot of deliciousness. Well worth the wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"That's right: the One and Only and reportedly one of Julia Childs' faves. Absolutely the best tortilla on the planet, and God bless Izzy for taking the orders behind the window for close to four decades. Go easy on the cheesy stuff because that bowl of Queso fills you up, but the tamales, lomos, and every carne will satisfy you to no end. Worth the wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We came here upon recommendation, which seemed to be well-justified as soon as we saw the line out the door! The wait to order was much longer than the wait for our food. I wish they would put a menu on the outside of the building too, because you aren't able to see the menu until you get closer to the front and you're about 2nd or 3rd in line. I do like how you can watch the kitchen while you're standing in line outside though. I ordered the tamales with cream cheese sauce since the sauce seemed to be their signature item here. It was definitely yummy at first taste, but it did become bleh after more and more bites. The sauce isn't as weird as it sounds either...it's just very creamy and cheesy! I tried a bite of their enchiladas and that was the winner for me. The guacamole on top was the best part... they should just put that on all of their dishes!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Umm, yum!  My boyfriend & I stopped here on a little road trip from LA, and so glad we did!  We ordered the super rica especial, chorizo quesadilla, steak tacos & pork tacos (approximately...).  The tortillas were amazing.  I haven't stopped thinking about them since.  Any recommendations for similarly savory tortillas in LA?  
Anyway, the especial was definitely the big winner.  Peppers, pork, cheese...  mmm.
Everything else was good too.  Also, I loved the salsas.  The pico de gallo was so good, and way spicier than you usually find (which is my preference).  
We got there around 3 on a Friday afternoon, and didn't wait at all to order!  I was pleasantly surprised, as the trip took considerably longer than expected and we were near-starved upon arrival.  
Anyway, I am so incredibly in favor of La Super-rica Taqueria.  You can bet I'll be back the next time I'm heading north on the 101.  And, did I mention how good those tortillas were?  Damn!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Simply the best.  I always have to get the la superica especial. I believe is #16.  The chorizo and cheese, 14, is devine.  Everything fresh and a possible new menu in the works.  

Coming soon....   YAY!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"LA SUPER RICA?!?! more like... LA SUPER RIP-OFF!!!
This place was such an enormous disappointment. By the looks of the restaurant you would think it was an authentic mexican restaurant and a humble one at that. But after ordering sopes, two tacos and a drink, and realizing our total had come to 19.28!! We knew that this place was a little more than deceiving. AND, they dont take cards of any kind, so after ordering our food, we had to walk and additional 2 blocks to the atm down the street, just to pay for the over-priced meal!! So we get back and pay and are informed that our food is ready and we go to the pick up window to see two tiny tacos and 3 baby sopes. When i order tacos and they come to $20, Im expecting them to be accompanied by at least some sides, or have multiple tacos per plate, but nope, not at super rica. The horchata we ordered was a ""large""...16oz for over 2 dollars?!?! One of my tacos was a chile con queso, and it tasted exactly like KFC's gravy...turn off?... I was EXTREMELY surprised to see that most of the customers there seemed to be regulars, as I know that I will NEVER set foot in that establishment again. One good thing to note however IS the tortillas...mmm... maybe they should just start selling tortillas, and stick to what they are good at."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,The employees are friendly but the service is very slow. The tortillas are great but overall the food is ok at best. Cash only.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Had to stop by this place. if Julia Child loved this place, I figured I should give it a shot...Several reasons why this place is good: The menu , ingredients, atmosphere and one reason why this place is not a 5 star review: price 

The Menu - Have some items not on the menu of a typical taco joint- alahambres, hand made gorditas, spicy frijoles, hand made tortillas for quesadillas, no tortas, etc

This was the part part for me. I love hand made gorditas and it's not an easy feat to find these.

Ingredients- My friend who went along with me, mentioned the quality ingredients used ( mainly he was referring to the meat). As both of us have lived in Mexico and traveled throughout the world , we both know most hole in the wall places have low quality meat and this place DOES NOT...

Atmosphere- Only in place like Santa Barbara could you a restaurant that's like a tent, lol...I'm exaggerating, but it's not an actual building. But i thought it was cool.

Price- A little pricey, although this is Santa Barbara and everything is expensive as hell here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great little hole in the wall! The #16 pasilla chili stuffed with cheese, pork, and homemade corn tortillas was excellent...a must have.  The #20 gordita with spicy refried beans is not for the tenderfooted.  This is quite hot, I stuffed it with some of my pasilla chili and pico de gallo...omg, was that good! The only reason I gave a 4 star, the carne asada taco was bland and over cooked. Be sure to try their fresh pico de gallo. This place will be my newest tradition when visiting Santa Barbara."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I don't get it at all. Everything I had was either very bland or very spicy. The tortillas are excellent, that I will say, but I really could take the food or leave it. With so many other wonderful places to eat in Santa Barbara I just don't see why you would chose La Super-Rica.  It really is just a bunch of Hype."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Well worth waiting in line. The aguas frescas were wonderfully refreshing, and we highly recommend the rajas and the super-rica especial. Whatever you try, you won't be disappointed! 
PS- cash only. Very inexpensive but come prepared!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"At first glance, this nondescript - except for its vivid turquoise paint job - shack hardly looks like the type of dive Julia Child would have visited once, let along frequented on a regular basis. But this was in fact a favorite of the grande dame of French cuisine, who spent her final years in upscale Montecito, the lush enclave of the rich and sometimes famous located at the eastern end of Santa Barbara. I'm not sure if Julia was forced to line up with the rest of the regulars who do just that, often up to an hour, all day long throughout the year. The tiny kitchen specializes in gourmetized versions of the street food sold on corners in sleepy little Mexican towns. There are no chips and dip here, nor is it a place where the same four ingredients are combined in twenty different preparations. Tamales are overloaded with corn, onions, chayote, and pasilla peppers. Tacos, made with thick, handmade corn tortillas, bear little resemblance to those found in Tex-Mex joints - taco de rajas is a mix grilled pasilla chiles and onions smothered with melted cheese, which also blankets the taco de calabacitas, a combination of tender marinated pork and stewed zucchini. The specialty of the house is a pasilla chile stuffed with grilled pork, roasted until it's just barely charred. Each item has its own texture and spices, and no two taste alike. Obviously, Julia knew a good thing when she tasted it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Nice lunch after day of golf. Full of upper middle class white people.  There were no minorities here, which is odd given the neighborhood.  Still, the food was good but not great!  I think for Mexican you can get better food in the area. Actually, after we left we went to another Mexican restaurant down the street and ate again. Prices are a cheap, but I think a little higher because of the patrons.

We order several items.  Nothing memorable or exciting.  What do you expect from a place with lawn furniture and pick nick tables for furniture.

I would definitely return but Super-Rica Taqueria wouldn't be my first choice."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great taco place,  delicious options. Don't expect a restaurant experience though. The location isn't anything special either. You order at a window and can sit.  There is a lot of nice seating. The place was clean. There was a line when we got there but it moved very fast. The line was steady though.  People kept coming. Seemed to be a very popular place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I don't mean to be an iconoclast here, but La Super-Rica is decent but nothing special?! Everything is covered in cheese (good and bad) and the ingredients are super fresh but the whole turns out less than the sum of its parts for some reason. That being said, the corn tortillas are amazing. Also, they're probably busy enough to justify the expense of accepting credit cards."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Wow...how is this place not a solid 5-star?

Two problems - lines and finding a place to sit.  That alone should tell you how incredible the food is.

If you are about finding great food..especially great Mexican food...you HAVE to eat at La Superica."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I just moved to Vancouver BC and am currently dreaming of Super-Rica. Their tacos are dreamy and I want one just from typing this. Any chance you guys could mail some up north?
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Esta muy rica la comida pero no aceptan tarjetas de pago nose por qué. Pero en la actualidad. Las tarjetas son la más común quedaron atrapados  en la época de Dom porfirio Días por que soso aceptan puro dinero ya estamos ene siglo 21. Es para que se modirnanicen más  como era en la catualidad
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Get ready for a long line. We waited for about 40 minutes on a Thursday night around 7. The tamales are delicious. Soft and sweet. The chile rellenos taco was great too. The prices were a little steep for a place where you stand in line and pick up your food from a counter, but overall a good experience."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Hands down the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had. Everything is made to order and the tortillas are made fresh in front of you. It is cash only and there can be a line at peak times but it's worth the wait.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Authentic, family run, great food. Simple, cash only, delicious."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Love Love Love it. So do all my friends. Julia Child, NY Times, LA Times all agree, 5 stars! Home made tortillas, amazing specials. You won't get food like this anywhere. Have the specials, thank me later.  Not like other places. Best of its kind."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Lived up to the hype. Fresh and hand made. Lived up to snype. Long lines and slow wait.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Unfortunately, it is very overrated. It seems like tourist love it for its back story but when compared to other places in town it does hold up.."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Hated this place!!! I did like the quesadilla, but I got a taco & a quesadilla w/ the pork & it was gross. The meat was nothing but fat!! I spit it out w:/ each bite!!! I will NEVER go back there!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"LOVE. Just went on 5/27. I don't know how anyone can give food this fresh & yummy less than 5 stars. Yes, it is a taqueria - nothing fancy. But good and cheap and unusual (cream sauce on the tamal de verduras - never seen anywhere else - so good).  It is not full of options for vegetarians like me, but even if they didn't have the tamal too, I could eat about 5 of the cheese quesadillas with salsa fresca and be happy. My only gripe is, we didn't order enough food for how delicious it was, and the line is too long to stand in twice."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This place is a historic part of Santa Barbara Latin cuisine... This is a place that everyone must try! Delicious homemade corn tortillas compliment the dishes that are a bit on the heavy side. You must order three or four items to fill you up and you will have a wonderful array of delectable delights! Try numero 17 the cheese tomato mix will compliment any of the other items on the menu! Beware not the best date spot because the ambiance is an absolute zero!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"fabulous tortillas, small portions, but low prices."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Dont waste your time in line here!! We have lived in sb for 25 years.. and it kills us every time we drive up milpas and see the que outside... you people need to go up the street towards Canon Predido on the corner .. Tacos Buen Gusto ! excellent food for a betterprice and portions! A lityle authentic hole in the wall!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,i miss this place
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Trying a place out for the first time can sometimes result in a hit or miss but in the case of Super Rica, it was a definite Bulls eye. Will return here again"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"i can't help but give this place 2 stars. after reading the tremendous reviews and listening to my friends talk about how amazing the food was....i was really not impressed. the food was bland and the wait was forever and ever. it reminds me of pinks hot dogs... for some reason it's this legendary place...you wait forever and ever to get this nasty mcnast-o hot dog. 
i got a vegetarian tamale... and it was covered in some not so tasty sauce. perhaps this place is more appealing to people who eat meat.... they have tons of meat dishes... 
despite my dissatisfaction with the food, the prices were very good and the people were very friendly."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Came here because of all the amazing yelp reviews I saw. When I got to the restaurant their was a huge line which went by pretty fast because of the great staff working there. In the end I just didn't like their food that much everything else was really good.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is actually the BEST TACO PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. I live in LA, and  will drive up there just to go there, its amazing. There might be a 20+ min line, but if you go for sit-down food, it would take longer, and not be as good. Its amazing, the people are so nice, and the food!!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Obviously, there's a line to order. That's fine. I knew that was going to happen. I lived in NYC, so I'm used to long lines. But I didn't realize it would take 30 minutes to actually get our food. We were order number 48. Every other order got called, including 50, and 1...oddly enough. But finally, we get our food. It was good, but not 30 minutes good. Needed more flavor for something that took forever."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I always stop here when we go to Santa Barbara! It never disappoints. Everything is delicious and worth the wait! 
Rajas is my favorite! 

Yum!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Watch out! this place only takes cash, no cards! And yes, lines even at non-rush hours, and parking nearby is a pain, came all the way here to try it out but so disappointed! Will try next time when I have more time and cash on hand!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Love it.  Haven't been in years as I am not from the area.  My visiting Columbian friend wanted authentic Mexican food. Bingo!  
Still the same, still amazing and cheap!  Weird that the whole place is filled with middle aged gringos. Try the soup made with cheese and a thick strip of smokey bacon...OMG."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"this place is an institution so might be worth going off hours. chorizo is awesome, corn tortillas are rich....."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The tortillas at this place are very good. They are homemade pressed and put on the griddle in front you. The service was great the man at the counter was very patient with us since we haven't been here before. We ordered a #6, #17, #20, #3, #11, #1, #4, #5. Some of the meat was dry but the others were top notch. This place is authentic don't expect any fancy sauces or sour cream. If you're like us, order some guacamole to put on everything, I think it makes it much better."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"On a whim ended up here after a wine tasting trip in Solvang.  A girl at the UPS store recommended this to us and we were highly impressed.  After reading reviews I ordered three different items and that definitely was too much food to finish.  I really loved the veggie tamales and the homemade tortillas.  We did wait in line for about 40 minutes at 2pm on a Saturday.  Also, be warned ... this is no bathroom at this place and they only take cash.  If you're adventurous and not starved, this place is highly worth the stop."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We ate here on a recommendation from a friend.  They raved about it.  I thought, OK I'm from the San Joaquin valley near Fresno, and we have excellent tacquerias....but we'll give it a try.  Everyone says in their reviews that it's authentic Mexican food.  I chuckled as I looked at their menu board...I saw an item called ""melted chesse between 2 tacos""...isn t that a queadilla??  Let's be authentic!  When you order your food, you can see a gal making homemeade tortillas behind the counter...the tortillas werevery good.  The guacamole portions were big.  But.............I would never wait in line for 1-2 hours for their food.  That's really ridiculous.  I've had much better Mexican food for a wait of 5 minutes or less.  Come on people."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Minus the insane lines, this place is a solid four stars.  I had this massive letdown from the years of hype, but you live and learn., but the wait is a major pain.  I waited at least an hour from stepping in line until getting my food. Plus side is, you meet people from all over California.

It's a good place to eat, if the line isn't too long, if you're in town or want an extended break on a road trip.  Do not go out of your way, like I did.  If you live in LA, there are much better options nearby."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Delicious!!!! The special vegetable tamale won the highest ranking, but everything we offered a mouthful of goodness."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Amazing!  I had a #11 and a #16, both had pork.  The tortillas were homemade....FANTASTIC!  Lots of cheese on each item. The sauces had just the right kick.  We had guacamole for the table, delish, and a perfect companion to the food.  There can be a line.  We waited about 15 minutes to order and about another 15 for our food, but we all thought it was worth the wait!!!  Take CASH....no debit/credit."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Such a HUGE disappointment! We heard so many good things about this spot, from trip advisor reviews to the woman sitting next to us on the plane to Santa Barbara. We stood in the long line, read the menu board several times, looking forward to all the deliciousness we were going to order......then we sat down and waited for our number to be called. Our food was ready and when took the first bites it was SO bland and 3 of the dishes we ordered basically tasted the same. The best thing was the pork tamale. Wouldn't waist the time or money to go there."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Very well known and great food. They make time tortillas right there.  Steak was delicious as was the chorizo and pork.  Had a marinated pork tortilla and it was excellent.  Steak tacos were excellent.  The pico sauce and salsa was delicious.  If I lived near, I'd be here all the time"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Ok, I don't get it.  It was a crazy long line and then not too many veggie options.  $27 for the two of us with two beers, and stuff tasted okay, but I wasn't blown away."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It's good and all, just way overrated. There are 5 other places on Milpas alone which have nearly the same quality of food and which don't require you to call out sick so that you can spend the day waiting with 300 posers who think that they have discovered an authentic ""hole in the wall."""
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Holy cow, where to begin! This place is heavenly! Food is heavenly! Worth every minute of my time waiting in line!

Make sure to bring your plate to the salsa bar and load up on the Pico de gayo. It's so good, I can eat a whole plateful as salad.

Don't forget the horchata (real homemade stuff here!)

Will be back again whenever we are in or near Santa Barbara!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Long lines, but these are some tasty tacos. Authentic Mexican food, and it's not expensive... so the long line is worth it. There are some good veggie options, but the main attraction is the delicious and high quality meats. Try the Chorizo tacos or Quesadillas, and try the Cinnamon-infused coffee."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great food, modestly priced, handmade tortillas & everything is made fresh.  Pork, beef, chicken & several vegetarian options.  Personally love the green salsa that has a hint of lime.  Beer is available & limited parking, always can find street parking.  Expect a line to order your food, it's that popular, but once you order the wait is not as long."

6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I'm in the minority here -  I know a lot of people love this place. We were just in town for the day and were told this place was great - Julia Child said so, blah, blah, blah. 

Waited 40+ minutes and by the time we reached the front I will admit the menu board made the dishes sound delicious (could be that I was ready to faint by that point). 

I'd been inside holding a table for ages so by now I've seen how small the portions are - we knew to order a little more than we were planning to. 

Several steak tacos & chorizo and cheese tacos later - I'm thinking to myself, who thinks this much cheese is a good idea? At least all that cheese was hot because the steak tacos definitely were not. 

I think maybe we should have ordered the tamales as they looked really good. And on the subject of the homemade corn tortillas... I was really looking forward to them - I watched the woman making them one by one. In the end, they were doughy and also cold.  Maybe this is what authentic Mexican food is really like?

Probably won't go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Annual visit checked off this past weekend. The tamal de verduras was again listed as a special - at this point I'm thinking it's a regular item that they just don't have room for on the chalkboard. Don't forget the horchata!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic food. Great variety of very authentic Mexican cuisine. Friendly, helpful staff. Some of the local patrons, however, were very inconsiderate and rude. Here's a tip: the line is slow. Figure out what you want to order while you are waiting. Don't flood the staff with questions; these are tacos, tamales, gordas, not intricate preparations. Figure on two orders of tacos per person, minimum. Great food. Highly recommended."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I am by no means a Mexican food snob, but I really liked this place. The line was there, as forewarned by yelp reviewers, but it gave me time to scan their sizable menu, and it took less than 10 minutes. It is indeed cash only, and the drinks are bottled or canned, but that's the kind of establishment this is, and they have openly accessible recycling receptacles (awesome). 
I ordered #8, Alambre de Pechuga, one of the chicken dishes, and I was very pleased. It had a perfect amount of spice, the veg was perfectly sautéed, crisp and flavorful. The tables were clean (I shared one with 3 other gentlemen because it was quite busy, but it was nice to talk to some strangers). Their salsa was nicely prepared, though the placement right at the pickup window seemed slightly ill-advised. Still delicious, though! Definitely a recommendation! Oh, and bring comfortable shoes because you will have to park on one of the adjacent streets and walk in!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Over-rated. Quality but expensive for a taco stand. So Julia Child loved it -- that isn't enough to commend it for me.  It now has a life of its own. You can do better re the matrix of quality-interesting(not Tex-Mex)/cost.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Oh Man.  Where do I begin?  My sisters and I hit this place up and it was better than I remembered from my visit before (but it had been at least 6 years).  

Great atmosphere and nice mixed crowd.  The order taker is an adorably cute gentleman and if you don't know what you want ask him to recommend something.l  We ordered about 6 items to share and I asked him to pick the last one and his was the highlight of our little lunch fiesta.

Here is what we ordered (and not in order):

Tecate with Lime

Horchata - Grande

Pechuga Suiza - Chicken/Cheese served between 2 corn tortillas

Carne Asada Tacos (a bit dry, but some salsa on it and make it wet)

Carnitas Tacos  (a bit dry as well)

Green Chile and Cheese served between 2 sheets of corn tortillas (my sister saw them charring the chiles on the grill and wanted to try it, super sweet but I wish we got them without the cheese)

Side of Today's Special - Arroz/Rice

Side of Guacamole

Today's Special - Tacos Deshrebada ( shredded beef served with a creamy avocado sauce, um yes please)

The Recommendation - Chilaquiles ( hot chips drenched in a spicy tomato broth mixture then topped with cheese and grilled green onions - just gorgeous)

After he placed the Chilaquiles for us then other people started to order and one lady asked if I special ordered them since she didn't see them on the menu.  Minutes later they placed Chilaquiles on the Today's Special Board. 

Um you could say we left full.  Salsa bar is a nice touch and the covered patio seating is awesome.  This place is always packed especially during lunch and it's funny to watch the locals practice their Spanish with the man in charge."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This is a pure-hype restaurant that out-of-towners help keep alive.  If you like to wait in line in the sun and get a meal with too much melted cheap cheese, then sit in an insect-encrusted indoor-outdoor dining room, this is your place!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Soooo goood!!!!! Mmmnnmmm.... There's long lines for a reall good reason. And the owners are really nice.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Well, I finally made it out again. 
This time I remembered to bring the camera for photos of all the great food that this little hole in the wall place has to offer.

My brother and his family were so amazed of all the great flavors; especially  the tamal de verduras (vegetable tamale).

I think my brother's wife and I agreed on three items; tacos de chuleta (pork steak), the taco de rajas with cheese and of course the vegetable Tamal.
The coffee here is made traditional style with canela (cinnamon) and panocha (brown sugar)

The tacos de bistec are very tasty (beef steak)
The #16 is VERY GOOD!! your choice of meat..we tried adobada and steak.

I know.... quite a few people on Yelp or at the restaurant have difference of opinion ...that is quite alright! 
I still think that this place has true mexican flavors! the steak is good but I had better steak tacos in Downey, CA ...Tacos los Gordos  http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-los-gordos-downey

But I must say the other goodies here are truly AMAZING!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,This place is so over hyped. Not worth wait. You can do better.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"uh YUM CITY.

beef tortillas - unreal.
chicken cheese tortilla - give me more.
enchilada special something or other with shredded chicken, avocado and cream sauce -- WHOA

this place is a tiny little spec on the culinary map but it is totally awesome.  everything from the decor to the slow service, the limited menu, the serve yourself salsa bar...just loved it. perfect for a casual lunch."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"After reading the reviews, I couldn't wait for a good meal.  I was pretty disappointed.  The special, a chile relleno was sitting in a cream sauce that was bland, like thickened milk.  The relleno itself was ok, but barely warm.  My wife had a taco, which was decent, nothing I'd return for."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Delicous, delicous, delicious. I wouldn't argue that it's the BEST Mexican food in Santa Barbara, but it is definitely among the best. The line is usually out the door and around the corner. It's a small place with not a whole lot of parking, but it's worth the search for a spot! 

I'd say what makes this restaurant great are the tortillas. Made fresh at the restaurant, they're soft and savory."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The tacos are among the worst in SB.  With a mediocre set of salsa options.  Add insult to injury, the line is extremely long.  More of a condition of their lack of efficiency than a demand for their food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I drive from SF to SoCal fairly often and I can't think of the drive without thinking of how much I want to go to La Super Rica.  The freshness and the quality of the ingredients speak for themselves.  This is why there is always a long line - and it 's not just tourists in line.  They definitely have regulars and fans from all walks of life. 

The tortillas are chewy and thick, freshly made (they have an open kitchen so you can see all the action).  The guacamole (which you shouldn't miss) tends to sell out if you get there later in the day.  In fact, I stopped coming late in the day because they do run out of popular items.  The chilaquiles seem very popular with the regulars though I haven't tried them.  

I also like how the place is a shack with a covered patio in the back.  Always makes me feel like I'm on vacation when I'm sitting there sipping on horchata and waiting for my small plates of delicious, hot off the grill Mexican goodies.

I recommend that you get the La Super Rica Especial (#16): marinated pork, pasilla pepper, melted cheese on top of three chewy homemade corn tortillas.  Add salsa.  Sooooo good.

One thing they could work on: the salsas are quite good but not great.

Update:  Recently I had #1, the steak soft tacos.  The steak was a bit tough but the guacamole helped.  I've had quite a few things on their menu and I recommend #16 + the guacamole.  I love their soft, supple corn tortillas which they make from scratch - they're so much better than the corn tortillas you get at other places."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This was good. We got the raja chile, steak tacos, chicken tacos, enchilada, beans, and horchata. Beans were too runny but tasty. Steak was just ok. Everything else was awesome!! Super friendly staff too and salsa without onions was an option!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I'm giving this 4 stars, although recognizing that it is a dive --- albeit a very popular one.  You will very likely end up standing in a line to get in here.  Essentially you order the food at the window, wait for your number to be called and then pick it up and bring to your table. 

The food is all incredibly fresh and made directly in front of you behind the ordering window.   The tortillas are being made from scratch as necessary - which is essentially nonstop.  

We ordered the Tacos de Adobado (marinated pork), Tacos de Chorizo, Quesadilla con Chorizo and the Frijole Super-Rica (pinto beans with chorizo, bacon and Chile).    It was all delicious. 

There is no parking so you end up trying to find a place along one of the side streets.  It's all good.

Again, the food was great - very fresh - and very basic ---  would definitely come back again!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"La Super-Rica Taqueria was featured on Man vs. Food.

I ordered the La Super-Rica Especial which is what Adam Richman had when La Super-Rica was featured on Man vs. Food.

The La Super-Rica Especial is roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese, with marinated pork. This yummy combination comes piled on top of three homemade tortillas for you to create your own tasty soft tacos. 

The amount of food is enough for you to stuff your tortillas and create some very plentiful tacos. 

Caution, they accept cash only.

Great food, friendly and fast service, and phenomenal value, gives La Super-Rica Taqueria five stars."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Sweet place to eat at in Milpas. Yummy tacos and beers to accompany them.colorful atmosphere and friendly staff. Wonderful outdoor seating area. Fun place to chill with friends and loved ones and experience the great Mexican food of SB.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Amazing. I tried the veggie tamale. It was amazing!! Tried their chili relleno. Unbelievably good!!! Tried the #16 and it was a 8 out of 10. Just needed some crema Mexicana. Their watermelon drink was to die for.  Thanks super rica!!! Long lines so be ready.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,They have the best horchata and tamales. Seriously. Get the horchata!! The tacos on the other hand were so-so. Nothing fabulous and def not worth the wait.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I'm not quite understanding the hype?

As expected the line was  long outside the door. Waiting in line for a while, I thought the food would be very tasty and filling.  We ordered the #16, tacos, quesadilla, horchata, and agua frescas.

I was quite disappointed. It's nothing special in comparison to all the other Mexican food places throughout Los Angeles and even in San Diego. The meat in the tacos were dry and not as flavorful as I had hoped. The horchata was too overpowered with cinnamon. The #16 was pretty good and the chorizo in the quesadilla had good chunks in it. Usually chorizo is served grounded so I like that it was kept in slices.

What really turned me off from this place was the fact that this family of four rolls up in their honda with tinted windows. They don't even wait in line for their food. The guy walks straight up to the window where they call out their food and orders there. I couldn't quite understand what the guy and the worker were saying to each other because they were talking in Spanish. As you can assume, that family of four that skipped the line got their food on the next called out order afterwards. I think that's pretty unfair that the the guy just walks up to the window and gets all his food for his family right away while many people are still waiting for theirs. I'm not happy with that service. Pretty unfair. 

CASH ONLY. There's street parking, and they have a small lot. It fits maybe like 3-5 cars."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Who in SB doesn know this place!!!
Even in LA i get people asking me about here.
Ive found better in LA, but when trotting back through
SB this is a stop on the way."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We were originally planning to eat at Los Agaves, but it was too crowded for our taste on a saturday night.  Luckily, there was a great alternative a few steps away!  The friends that I were with had already been here once and said it was an ok place. With that strong recommendation, we made our way over there.  To me, it's usually a good sign when there's a line out the door so I was excited to try it out.  

The menu is a large blackboard (yes, the ones that use chalk) that had about 20 different options from quesidillas to tacos to soups.  I got their chorizo quesidilla and marinated pork tacos with some guacamole.  And of course horchata.  Everything I ate was delicious.  It's not that gourmet, Americanized, super-sized Mexican cuisine.. it's small home made tortillas with fresh ingredients. It was inexpensive and delicious.  Glad that we tried it out and I'd definitely come back to this taco shack."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is authentic Mexican restaurant. Hand made tortillas being made. Prices very reasonable. Chili relleno, corn tamales and fresh salsas and pico de gallo! Plenty of seating but very popular place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Overrated! Not worth the wait. The steak tacos, number 1, are bland. Although the tortillas are really nice, there's nothing else in the taco, just bland steak. Instead of fighting for a table look for a better option."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I really can't figure out all the hype about this place?

Wasn't on my list of places to eat while on vacation in Santa Barbara, but read about it in a local magazine, so we went.

Incredibly LONG and SLOW line to order and then again to actually get your food.

Pico and tortillas were very good, but the rest of the food was mediocre at best.

They only take cash so be prepared.

Would not return - sorry Julia."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Good frijoles super rica e adobada, mediocre Alhambra de pechuga and bistec. P liked the salsa."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The corn tortillas used are the most amazing thing I have ever tasted! They are light, fluffy and delicious! My friends have been telling me for years to check this place out but every time I would go by the lines were long so I would pass, boy was I missing out! 
The chile relleno is one of the best I have ever had, cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce...yum!
Everything I ordered was delicious and the employee that took my order was super sweet and patient it was my first time there and I wasn't really sure what to order! Can't wait to go back!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I was very excited to eat at this place because of the great reviews. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The only good from this place were the homemade tortillas and the watermelon drink. Otherwise this place is not authentic. At least the tacos were not."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is, by far, my favorite place to eat on Planet Earth!  Try my combo...#2, #4 and a #11. Add two Corona's...Call me in the morning!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,When Julia Child used to eat in a restaurant you should know its 5 stars.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Good solid tacos. You watch them make the corn tortillas, and they load the tacos up with fine grilled meat, or if you order any cheesy things, they serve the melted cheese with meat in a bowl with the tortillas on the side.

If you want any kick in the tacos, you can load them up with the red sauce, green sauce or pico de gallo. I'd recommend doing it to deal with the extremely gooey cheesiness of anything with cheese.

This place is good in the quality and freshness of the food, and the simplicity of the tacos bring that out. The line is quite long though, but Santa Barbara is such a chill place a little waiting shouldn't matter. One thing that bothers me was the number of flies in the dining area. They should do something about it..."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"CASH ONLY and be prepared to wait in line on a weekend! 

Must order: la super-rica especial... it's life changing!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Sometimes you don't have to find a ""foo-foo"" restaurant for some really good food. This place is half spanish market, half kitchen, all goodness! One order is ample enough to feed two people- unless you're 18 and you're metabolism is still in the puberty stage- Burritos are highly recommended and just overall delicious!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I was born and raised in Los Angeles and basically grew up on Mexican food. Without getting into the debate over what is ""authentic"" Mexican food and what is not, I'll just say that La Super Rica serves up more delicious food than any Mexican establishment I grew up with in 25+ years of living in L.A.

The #6 is to die for. While it doesn't look like much, those grilled pasilla peppers and onions sautéed with cheese are one of the most amazing concoctions I've ever tasted. For other vegetarian options, the #13 Queso de Cazuela is awesome, as is the #17 Chile con Queso. The #20 Gordita with spicy ground beans is great, too.

I don't live in Santa Barbara, but make a special point to stop here any time I'm passing through. The only complaint is that they are cash-only and, of course, having to wait in the line that can often take 30 minutes. That being said, it is always worth the wait, and even worth the roughly two hour drive from San Luis Obispo."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"OK, so don't go here if you think Mexican food is burrito fare -- you'll be disappointed, not to mention you won't find any on the menu. However, what you will find is is that their food is downright fresh, delicious, and authentic. Try #6 -- the Rajas. One of the best things to sink your teeth into! The portions are small so be ready to order at least two items. The owner is always taking the orders and is super nice. I've got great service every time I've gone. Oh! And order an extra side of tortillas for a buck!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The tacos are amazing and so is their horchata. I got to try the chorizo (my fav), carne asada and pork. 

My bf and I drank our horchatas so fast that we wanted refills but didn't want to wait in line. Turns out that refills only cost a buck each and you can get some from the side!!! Yay."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,We loved the food so much but the service was even better!!!! You should not miss this place!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Long line for the worst tacos ever. The meat is dry and very bland, the tortillas are the only redeeming thing. They only accept cash so that's also an inconvenience. Terrible set up of having you wait 15 minutes at the order window after they made you wait 1 hr in the line outside. Completely ignored at the order window till the older guy feels ready to deal with taking your money for the most boring food ever. The inefficient set up and old facilities = worst experience ever. It's not worth the hype. There are so many other better taco places with really great customer service and flavorful food. Go anywhere else but here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Less than mediocre taco joint, running on seemingly nothing more than a good word from the late Julia Child at SOME point in history. 

I have to believe after eating there a few times, that whatever Julia Child found amazing about this place must be long gone. The time it took to place an order was long (about five minutes) with only one person ahead of us in line. It took a half hour to get our three tacos and the place was not crowded. The tacos were tasteless and I really was amazed out how blah it was. 

We went there only because our friends who were visiting from LA had heard about it and wanted to go. I had never heard that it was put on the map because of Childs until they informed me of this as we ate there today. I have been there 3 times during my 13 years of living in SB, and in the past I couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about? Today I finally concluded that there truly is NOTHING to be excited about, just a good review gone bad! 

Sadly, there are enough tourists who will make the mistake of eating there at least once, to keeping the line out the door on Child's outdated seal of approval... and the cycle will continue...

They may have been good at some point, but fame has a way of changing things, even a taco stand."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Another classic Santa Barbara institution. Great taqueria; homemade tortillas are fantastic but the meat on top is what takes the prize. My favorite thing on the menu though has to be the tamales. The fish tamales are fantastic. 

Avoid the usual long line out front by dropping by for dinner, not lunch."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"In one sentence - the wait was so worth it! We waited over an hour in line before ordering, but despite the hot sun, I was SO happy we stayed in line. It was my first time, but my friend is a loyal customer. I totally over-ordered because I was starving, not to mention everything is so cheap. My favorite was the Enchiladas de Plaza...so amazing! The #16 was also incredible. Pork tacos were my favorite of the bunch. For chili-heads, nothing here is close to being was I would consider spicy. The cashier warned me the #20 gordita was very spicy (corn tortilla filled with spicy refried beans) - alas it was not. Will definitely go back! Yum!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I really wanted to love this place. From all the Yelp reviews I expected great food, but I was so disappointed! I waited in line for 30 minutes and was really hungry, so ordered 7 different items. Out of the 7, only 2 were okay. The tamale de mole and the posole had the most flavor. The chicken and steak taco, guacamole, and gordita were lacking flavor. Definitely not worth the wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Killer. Don't miss the bowl of melted queso in tomato sauce - seriously. This is not your typical taqueria. The food is prepared very simply but the flavor is unsurpassed.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,This place is just ok. After hearing so much about it I tried it and thought it was completely bland (the tacos come with just meat nothing else). I went back to try some other dishes after I continued to hear good things but I still found the food to be pretty mediocre.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Some of the best,authentic Mexican food I've had in Santa Barbara! And Julia child even has her stamp of approval on this place! Get there early though, because the line has been out the door everytime I have gone to eat."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My DH and I have been coming here for years and it's always consistent and good. There is nothing like it in my neck of the woods. No matter what you order from here, it will be good. I think we've tried everything atleast once and have even taken food to go which has been perfectly good after the two hour drive home. If I had to pick a favorite I'd say it's the Chile Relleno con Crema or Super-Rica Especial which has some delicious pasilla chiles with cheese and pork on top of handmade tortillas."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The chorizo con queso is amazing!  The chicken tacos are great too.  Did not care for the asada tacos though, they were bland and the meat was too chewy.  I've been there twice and both times the line was long, but worth the wait."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Having lived in SB for a very long time I can attest to the accuracy of Lemonjelly I.'s review below, although I think it's a little (a lot, actually) harsh.  The line does stretch out the door, there really are few to no locals eating here at any given time, and the place is to some degree overhyped.  However, many Santa Barbarians know and appreciate the place, eat there occasionally, know the absurdity of suggesting that La Superica is some hole in the wall taco stand off the beaten track, and furthermore know that La Superica does not purport to serve the typical Sonoran food that most people are familiar with.  

Mr. Gonzalez focuses on interesting flavor combinations and preparations derived from food eaten a bit further south.  I like the daily specials because they seem to use the most interesting ingredients, both in texture and taste.  Mr. Gonzalez really does know what he is doing, folks.  His food is authentic but original - just not the ""authentic"" of a taco shop.  Now that we live far away from home, we like to eat at La Superica - and Lily's, and (our favorite) La Simpatia in Guadalupe, whenever we visit.  The tortillas and pico de gallo are really excellent, the food is fresh, bright, and interesting.  

Hey folks, be nice to the guy!  Mr. Gonzalez has put a lot of effort into introducing folks from the US to a different Mexican cuisine than what you traditionally see here.  He's not let success go to his head, and has not sacrificed quality as his fame and fortune have grown."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I agree that the wait was loooong, no agua fresca fruit flavors and just mediocre food. I don't think i will be coming back for more.."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"If you are not that hungry and can wait for an hour to eat, then this is the place to eat. It takes forever to order and forever to get your food.
But, on the bright side of things, the food is delicious!!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place is very delicious, and for a NYer who used to live in California, it was a great reintroduction to delicious Mexican food.  The tortillas are made fresh before your eyes, and that makes all the difference.  I got the carnitas tacos, and i was amazed at how barebones they were. Just tortilla and some pork chunks. My dining companion got some vegetarian thing which looked great and healthy, and it was good, but a bit on the bland side. We both got veggie tamales, however, and they were divine! Perfectly cooked, tender and soft with a great crema/beschemel sause. The sandia was as overly sweetened as ever, but delicious.  One major negative was that it took ages for our order to arrive.  The other bad thing is that I would have gladly given this place four stars had I not discovered El Bajio just up the road. Review to follow, cuz that place is fantastic. I really liked the atmospher of Super Rica, however. It's in a cozy blue bungalow, and it feels like a cute covered picnic."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Very long lines for sub par food. With as many good taquerias as Santa Barbara has it's shocking this place gets 4 stars on yelp. The best thing I've had on the menu is the rajas tacos and I'd only give them 3 stars. Go to Monys tacos you'll be much happier...
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,It was well worth the wait in line the prices are great and the food was amazing. So you want to try something completely different from regular Mexican food this is a must try. Oh and handmade tortillas. One last thing CASH ONLY.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is so simple and so good and so original. Having grown up eating at places that heaped on cheese and sauce, and probably microwaved their food, as well as frozen enchiladas and burritos, La Supa-Rica is like re-education for your taste buds. Real quality, fast casual, and fun."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,My expectations were huge and unfortunately didn't meet them. I am Mexican and I felt like a needed that extra flavor. For me it wasn't authentic enough. The hour wait played a huge part in my stars also.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What can I say about a place that is world famous in both the public and in the restaurant world. World famous Restauranteurs are the customers. People who love good food are customers. I wish every corn tortilla was etherial as La Super Rica. My faves the tri tip taco plate and the chicken with veg and mushroom taco plate.

But the most important tip: if they have watermelon juice then order it and be happy."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Amazing mexican food! I had Tamal de Puerco, quesadilla de queso y chorizo and the plate number 16. 
The plate number 16 was a recommendation from owner. You will have to go there to see it :P

The tamale by far was the best tamale i ever had! 
The quesadilla was also amazing, made with handmade corn tortillas. PERFECT GLUTEN FREE SPOT! 
I'm celiac and finding a good gluten free quesadilla is very difficult."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This spot is a must try. It is a cute little spot with a HUGE tree out front. Due to its deliciousness and popularity, this place requires some what of a wait. I think we waited about 20-30 mins but at the moment that felt like an hour. We sat there poking our salsa and watching other people eat their delicious food. 

One tip though is - order everything you want when you order. The wait for your addition will probably take you way too long. 

We tried their tamal and a few other items and we left hungry but too impatient to wait for another round of food. I will definitely be back to this place and try more of their food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Unbelievable!!
We had heard about La Super-Rica from Nickel Creek (as an on-stage recommendation) and from Alias (tv show mentioned it) and have always wanted to visit, but it was always the wrong time.
We scored big this last weekend, as we ate on the way down to LA and on the way home again because we loved it so much.
Imagine our surprise as the special menu changes and the chile relleno that we had on Friday night was different from the one we ordered on Tuesday.
We over-ordered so we could share a variety of dishes and flavors. We weren't disappointed with anything we ordered, but especially loved the #16.
it's a good thing La Super-Rica is a 6 hour drive from home and not local, or we'd really have a weight problem!

We've eaten here two additional times now, on the way home from SoCal trips and La Super-Rica just gets better and better. The Chile Rellenos continue to change -- we haven't had the same one twice. Ok, so now I really wish that they were closer to home!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Silly lines throughout the day. Don't come hungry...you'll become hungry waiting in line.  Be sure to order more than one item, because everything is muy chiquita portions. Frijoles de sopa are great...but be careful of the salsa. When it's ""old"" you'll spend the next day very close to a bathroom. Cash only, no receipts.  Hmmmm."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"No. 16 with tortillas on the side. Get it. A tip from a customer in front of us and he was right. A roasted chili with shredded pork, cheese and magic. A selection of bottled beers and sodas. A little outdoor seating area. Very casual, great atmosphere."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"""Seriously, the BEST horchata!""

""Them FIGHTIN' words.""

""Yeah, well, it's TRUE!""

Not to mention the tamales. Enchiladas. Super RICA. Cafe de Ollo. 

WOW.  This was my second time around with a second set of those I keep closest to m'Heart --- and WOW.

It's not just the sauce. Not just the texture either. The flavors are indescribable.

6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"really? just because it was Julia Childs favorite Mexican food place does not make it good. 
this place is over priced and over rated."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"There is a reason why this is the most raved about taqueria in Santa Barbara! The tortillas are mouthwatering. The meat is always perfect. When you go, get the #16. You won't be disappointed."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Super yummy and cheap food not far from the main touristy area. Instead of eating yucky overpriced food at the wharf take a little stroll and come here!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The food is simple & delicious. The long line & lack of parking are annoying & the ""ambiance"" could use a little help but we keep coming back - for nearly 20 years!!!
We really like the Tamal De Verduras With Cream Sauce, Sopes, Alambre de Pechuga (#8), Rajas etc.................. We have tried it all and can say without a doubt - It's all Super Rica!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Mmmm so good. I have only been here once but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I think the portions are a bit small but so is the price. I guess it gives you room to try a bit of everything. Good selection, big menu. I will go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Great Mexican food. Kid friendly. Hot on a hot day - no AC but still worth it. Great prices! Great tamales! Great tacos! My favorite is number 8 add cheese.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Amazing, authentic Mexican food. I go there with my family very often. Yes, the place isn't a five star restaurant, but the food makes up for it. The actual place is very small and crowded and doesn't have a roof, but the food is absolutely amazing. 

As for food, I highly recommend the Chorizo especial and all things chorizo. Also, the Super Rica is very tasty."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"ugh, i'm tired of all the tools that frequent the restos here. go back to LA! oh wait, i was one of those tools until very recently. sundays are pozole days at super rica. yum! yesterday we had to wait in the usual line and had to hear about people's wonderful lives blah blah. and stand next to some douche wearing pink crocs. gross. 

but anyway, the pozole was amazing. i usually love the cheese and chorizo quesadilla, but it was lacking something yesterday. and i guess i never realized it was 3.50. uh, that's way too expensive for a quesadilla. well i guess everything is a bit over priced here, oh well. 

i sorta want to go back today for chilaquiles"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This place is Yum! It's good food at a great price. We always look for authentic cuisine and this place gets it right every time!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I gave this place 4 stars because everyone knows the Mexican food in the Santa Barbara area sucks so my expectations were not high. 


With that being said...the tortillas were DELICIOUS! I got al pastor tacos. I'm not one to pay more than $1.50 p/taco & here they charge $2.50 (which I think is a little overpriced given that the dollar tacos in LA are so much better!) Not mad at this establishment's hustle though for over charging tacos in a predominantly affluent Caucasian area lol! I see y'all...

ni cebolla tenían! los tacos de la camioneta en frente de este restaurante son mejores y más baratos! 
so if you want decent tacos in the area, I guess I would recommend this place. The taco truck across the street is better though and cheaper"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I gotta admit,  when it comes to Tacos,  I'm very picky.  But this place proved to be amazing.  I tried chicken  pork and shredded beef and all three of them were very well made,  perfectly seasoned and we'll made.  I would give it five stars,  but they don't accapt any other form of payment but cash. That's very inconvenient.  Additionally the wait was a bit longer than expected.  Overall,  I give it solid 4 stars."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We stopped at Super-rica vefore a show at the Santa Monica Bowl and I'm glad we did. 

After reading many of the reviews here I. Knew this was the place in SB for a preconcert meal. We were not sure how much to order, but knew that we needed to try an assortment of dishes to get various tastes as flavor.  We had chorizo tacos.  We had a daily special beef taco with guacamole on the side.  We had a fish tamal, the #16 Super-rica Especial, and one other plate. 

The tamal was wonderful and very tasty and had a rich cream sauce on top. The fish almost tasted like shrimp- but it was a fish. Memorable. 

The SR especial included marinated pork, roasted pasilla pepper and melted cheese and 3 Homemade/Handmade/Fresh corn tortillas which are made while you wait. That plate was generous with the meat and pepper and well flavored although the fresh pico de gallo added more flavor. 

Everything was great. The line out the door moved at a decent pace and it took less time to get out order after we placed it than I expected.  

Beer is cheap. 

I was disappoited that the Watermelon agua fresca had run out.  The smiling counterman who took our prder and money mentioned the Horchata as a possible alternative and Ibtried it for the first time in my life.  It was refreshing and sweet and can only be described as liquid rice pudding. Probably too sweet for many repeats for me, but it was good in the moment.  

I'd stop back anytime I was near Santa Barbara because the food was great, the price was right (great value for the money), the experience was fun, and the portions were just right.  

If La Super-Rica has gone downhill over time or is just resting on its laurels (and Julia Childs history of visits many years ago before she died), it must have been amazingly awesome then, because it is pretty awesome now."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Another vote for La Super-Rica. Fresh, delicious, worth finding, waiting, and eating. Read other reviews for details, but do go."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,There was a line out the door at lunch time and the wait is SO worth it! The food is fantastic. Cash only. You should definitely try this place.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great Mexican stand - lives up to the hype.

Here's a clip from an article by Cindy Price in last week's NY Times surveying taquerias up and down the coast (NY is finally discovering real tacos!):


""Do rich people eat tacos? I had heard that wealthy Santa Barbara was a hotbed of authentic taco activity, but I was hard-pressed to believe it. A cruise down quaint, tree-peppered North Milpas Street, however, confirms it. The street is lined with taquerias, including the one that started the craze --- La Super Rica Taqueria.

Known to many as ""the Julia Child joint"" --- she was a loyal customer until she died two years ago --- La Super Rica is bright and airy, and the tortillas are handmade on the spot. On the cashier's recommendation, I pair a taco de bistec (charbroiled steak) with a queso de cazuela (a heavenly cheese baked in tomato sauce).

Just as I'm sitting down with the owner, Isidoro Gonzlez, a white-bearded passer-by leans in. ""It's not just a taqueria, it's the best restaurant in town,"" he says. Heart be still, it's David Crosby. A fellow taco-hound! ""You don't have to continue any further,"" he says, eyes twinkling. ""This is it --- this is the place."""""
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place has a tiny kitchen, but still they manage to fit one person to just make tortillas, one person to just cook meat and roast peppers, one person to just take orders, money and get water / drinks, one person just to assemble the orders and one person to get the various odd order stuff.  We always found a line out the door, but it moved quickly. There tacos are more similar to other taquerias, while there specials are not as recognizable. They are delicious and unusual. For example, the cheese and bacon was a bowl of melted cheese and bacon with tortillas on the side. The chile relleno de queso con crema actually is a normal chile relleno in a warm cream sauce.  

The chiles are mild in the winter (perfect for me).  I don't know hot spicy they get in late summer."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Pretty good Mexican food, though I have to say I was a bit disappointed to not find any lengua or any other types of meat besides basic beef, pork, and chicken bits. Such is the way of things I suppose when you are trying to appeal to as many people as possible. Their food is still really good though. We ordered their adobado tacos, guac, quesadilla, pasilla chile stuffed with pork and cheese, and horchata. It was the perfect amount for the two of us, though we could definitely have eaten more. The flavors are authentic here, they even have freshly made tortillas done within view while waiting to order. Pretty awesome. The prices are cheap and service is pretty quick. Their salsa bar is also pretty fresh. Overall, great food, but I just wish for more variety!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This is some of the BEST Mexican food I have ever had. So much flavor and everything is sauced up and seasoned perfectly. The parking is TERRIBLE though. Totally worth it. Not a convenient location either. It's far from downtown. Oh well... I make an afternoon out of it and eat until I need copious amounts of antacids. yeyahh!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Great all around shop with lots of flavor and heart! I'll be dreaming about the 6. Rajas for a long time.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Just Rica...wouldn't say super rica!

Not really worth the hour wait, but it was good. The pozole is good and the tamal, also the chile relleno were very tasty.  We tried everything on the menu well about 90% and it was all decently good, but not mouth watering take me back to Mexico delicious. I would come back if the line wasn't so long. Friendly dudes here so that's a plus! 

At least try it once and so you can say you waited outside in the longest line of your life...makes a good story."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Great classic place to have authentic Mexican food!  From the ladies making tortillas from scratch to the super friendly guy working at the counter who apparently has been there since last century... but this place is the same as it's been all along!  Great food and great atmosphere... just be prepared to wait... the line wraps around the building all day and night!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Stopped here on a friend's recommendation and she was right, it was great. I ordered the chicken plate, with seasoned grilled skinless chicken, mushrooms, peppers and onions, piled onto 3 steaming hot tortillas. Perfect amount of food for a light meal, and a steal for $5.90. I only regret not ordering a few other things off the menu too, but next time!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"A lot of reviews already, so I'm just gonna get down and dirty...

Arrived Saturday afternoon @ 12:30. there was a line, but we waited all of 20 minutes.

The food: Just okay. We ordered the #16 Super Rica Especial, #7 tri-tip, #12 chicken pechuga and vegetable tamale. I don't eat pork, but I was told the #16 special was really good. the #12 chicken looked really good, but it was a pounded chicken breast cutlet sandwiched between 2 corn tortillas held together with cheese; basically a chicken bread quesedilla. Like other have said, the #7 is forgettable. the tri-tip was tough, and although cooked with onions and green bell pepers, it was kind of bland. It needed a lot more flavor. Even adding salsa and salt to it didn't imporove it much. Pass on it. the vegetable tamale is decent ,but I like my friend's sister's tamales much much better. It had a white cream sauce on it that didn't add anything to it at all, plus it was also a little bland but fresh. The best thing we had had to be the Fresh corn tortillas.  the sandia and jamica agua frescas were good too. 3.5 stars

The service: Really nice and friendly.  4 stars.

The ambiance: not much to say about it. It's a taco stand-ish. A little better than most though. 3.5 stars.
 

The price: I think it's a little pricy for what you get compared to most taco shops I've been to, and that's a lot of taco shops.  The #16, #7, #12, vegetable tamale and 3 small agua frescas came out to over $30. Seriously? $10/pp at a taco shop??? Steeeeeeeeep! 2 stars

Overall, 3 stars. I know it's a chain, but I like King taco in L.A. better.  Sorry Santa Barbara I heard the new place across the street that starts with the letter ""C""  has better tasting food, but I haven't hit it yet."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The food was good, the chairs are so uncomfortable and it can be a bit slow!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Didn't get the 20-30 min wait here, but tried it anyway.  The chilequiles were the best of what we ordered.  Basically nachos, but with a yummy red sauce & cheese.  The other items were forgettable.  And we spent $30 for a family of 5....ouch!  Too pricey for what we got.  Yes they were fresh but the flavor didn't really do it for me.  Sorry La Super-Rica!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Ever since I met my boyfriend he has been talking about Super Rica and how delicious it is.  Well, we took a trip to Santa Barbara and after a day window-shopping, he took me to this strange little bright-colored building.  I thought he was joking.

He wasn't.  The food is absolutely yummy!!  I love how cheesy everything seems to be and how fresh it is.  This place is definitely worth checking out."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"hella good mexican food. i swear one of these days, i will drive my ass down to SB just for their food. i've never had such good mexican food.

a complete whole in the wall in SB in the poorer part of town but hey, best Mexican food on the planet!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Amazing Mexican food. This is the real deal, and not like taco bell or la salsa. Everything is excellent. You could spend a week just trying all the great foods. If in santa Barbra you have to eat here. Any one who lives in the area and has not eaten here is....  I can't find a word to describe them. Just try it and see."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Came later so not as long a wait. Impressive to see tortillas being made in front of you. Overall not impressed by the food. 
One bright side of my experience is that there were lots of Anglos there who seemed to enjoy the food. This Anglo, however, only thought it was ok. 
I had pork suiza described as between tortillas. I expected that to he taco style. Surprised it was like a sandwich with tortillas instead of bread. My friend's tri-tip with 3 tortillas was served with tortillas on the bottom of the plate and tri-tip on top. Having lived in Mexico, neither of us saw that before. 
Disappointing. 
Tortillas were also spongy as if not fully cooked. 
My friend had a vegetarian tomale that he really liked. 
My bar may be high for Mexican food after living there and working in barrios in the U.S.  I was hoping for mamacita quality Mexican food from the reviews I had heard. Sorry it did not live up to expectations."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This is some of the best Mexican food I've ever eaten. Simply outstanding. My family and I waited for over 45 minutes on a Saturday evening and it was well worth it. We stopped in SB on our way to San Diego from SF and I would make a special trip  back to SB for this restaurant alone.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Honestly, this place seems more hype than substance or we don't really know a good taco when we eat one. After standing in line for 30 minutes, we were expecting something yummy but received something quite ordinary. The whole visit could be called ""an experience"" but not one we'll be recommending to others or planning again for ourselves. It's fun to see the assembly line of food being prepared in the kitchen through the glass windows but the vegetarian taco I tried and the meat tacos my fiance tried could be had elsewhere."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It was a long ass line but the food was not bad.  Now compare that to King Taco and well that place would be crap against them. But in a white boy town and everybody white boyish yeah the food aign't that bad. I ordered the maranaded pork taco and it was a little bland. I also ordered a chorizo quessadilla which was not bad and a bacon butter cheese something that was actually pretty darn good.  Though I should have eatten it first because it bacame all gooey buy the time I got to it. 

My companion ordered the pork soup that was filled with greesy stuff was okay except I myst be careful because too much grease can give me the thumbs down for the day if you know what I mean. Also ordered was I think a carne asada and a veg tamale.

Friendly peeps in line. We met a cool Apple blogger/ photographer/ reviewer guy and his son who where on there way to the Apple's developer speech thingy."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Best place we've ever eaten. Ever. That is not hyperbole. Anything on the menu is incredible!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love the old school made from scratch vibe.
You have to try it at least once and see for yourself.
This place always has a line, but it moves fast. Don't let that discourage you."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Please tell me where there is better mexican food in Los Angeles or Santa Barbara ? Totally worth the wait in line and be sure to have a look inside the kitchen as the ladies make the tortillas by hand from scratch!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The best pico de gallo you'll ever eat 
So delicious fresh reasonably priced food

Uncomfortable plastic chairs was unfortunate but the food is very good"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"One of the best taco stands I have been to in the US.
The only item I would not recommend was the Mexican Rice.

Loved the sauteed onion and pasilla chile taco. There are some nice vegetarian options here that you do not see anywhere else.

Long lines are a bummer, but it added to the adventure."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Summary: No frills, no AC, taco spot to head to when you are jonesing for some good Mexican food. 

Atmosphere: simple taco spot that stands out with its bright sea foam green paint job. There is seating in a shaded area but not air conditioning. This place has gotten more and more popular over the years so expect a line on the weekends. 

Cuisine: I love #16 ADABADO W/ CHEESE AND CHILE PASILLA. But I don't think you can go wrong so pick the meat you like and dive in. 

Alcohol:  they've got it. You typical beers 

Salsas: pico, good green sauce. Can't put my finger on what makes it different. Not a fan of the red sauce personally."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A conversation with friends inspired me to write this as we all discovered we love this place and none of us live in SB. The food is incredibly authentic, the service great, the flavors true. It's great for breakfast. You can't get better than this. Humble small place but big food reward!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I haven't had line issues but I usually eat here around 11 AM, before most of the lunch crowd arrives.  The food is fairly good (#16 with a Horchata is my fav) but I can think of a number of similar spots all over LA that deliver comparable food with less waiting time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Wow!  This place is great...if you like tasteless, tough, and utterly forgettable Mexican food!  We ordered four dishes:  bistec tacos, chorizo tacos, the gordita (thick corn tortillas with spicy bean paste), and the grilled pork quesadilla.  The food is bland, the wait long, and the cost too high for minuscule portions.  Where I'm from in San Diego, the hole-in-the-wall places are inexpensive and have flavorful food and giant portions.  Not surprisingly, my brother and I were the only two Latinos here!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I've been told by my brother to go here for a long time now...was very skeptical when I was told to expect at least a 20 minute wait in line and another 20 minute wait for my food.  Patience is not my virtue, but after visiting La Super-Rica Taqueria I'll be working on that!  Worth the wait my frieinds!!

Ordered the Rajas which were freaking amazing!  The pescado tamale was just okay, but the Rajas were to die for.  My meat eating friends were raving about their tacos as well.  Word to the wise, order 2 beers so after the long wait you can enjoy a cold brew while waiting for your delicious food to arrive.  Don't let the line scare you away, this place is spectacular and I can't wait to go back!  RAJAS RAJAS RAJAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(p,s,  CASH only!)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I have traveled extensively through Mexico and I still look forward to coming home to my favorite! The Especiale is not to be missed. Long line? It is worth the wait...really!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Ummm hell ya! I waited 38 minutes in line...and honestly id wait 138 minutes in that line, because this place murders it..i cried it was so good..."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I really like this place!  The homemade tortillas are definitely good, and I absolutely loved the Taco de Hongo (Mushroom taco).  I had no idea what it was when I ordered it, was super skeptical when I received it (it looked like a cat threw up food), but it was SO FREAKING DELICIOUS.  The creaminess, the mushrooms, the flavor... oh god it's SO good.  If that special is ever up, you MUST try it out!  

Can be pricy if you come really hungry, and the ""medium and large"" drinks are more like ""very small and small,"" but nevertheless, the flavors are all there.  The guy taking our orders was extremely nice as well."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Julia Child's favorite, they say? Well, Julia Child has been dead since 2004. Maybe this restaurant was amazing in the early 00s but I wouldn't know if that's the case. 
We went there in August of 2016 and the food tasted totally mediocre. Every member of my family felt sick 8 hours later. Add long lines and you've got a real dud of a restaurant."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We were headed to a different Taco place nearby, but when my nephew saw that there was no line here, he insisted we go.  Super Rica is super simple, menu on a chalk board, Tacos only, order one or one of each.  The Asada is awesome but the surprise favorite was the bacon queso, picture extra thick, chunky bacon diced in white queso.  a selection of red and green salsas is next to the counter where you pick up your order and grandma is behind the counter hand making some of the best tortillas I've ever had.  ambiance is very simple, picnic tables basically.  Cash only!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Totally worth the drive from LA. Amazing!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Seriously.  With all of these reviews, you really think I can add something -way- different?  Um, prolly not.  I've visited this joint several times over the last 15 years and haven't had a bad time yet.  The only bad thing on rare occasion would be the lines and the limited seating if you go at a peak time.  This has only been a problem for me a handful of times over all these years, so that's really nothing worth complaining about.

Damn good food.  Damn good prices.  Damn good service.

Go here.

Werd."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My favorite Mexican food restaurant in Santa Barbara--and in the world. It's constantly featured in national publications such as Sunset Magazine, Travel and Leisure, Forbes, NY Times, LA Times, etc., and I agree with the late Julie Childs--it's the ""best mexican food restaurant west of the Mississippi"". http://ow.ly/y3Iux.  The owners--Isidoro and Martin, are wonderful beyond words. Great food, great people, incredible prices.  You can't go wrong."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"It is rare when a recommended restaurant lives up to it's legend... But la super rica did for sure. There's no hiding behind chips, beans and rice here.  It is straight up glory served on tiny homemade corn tortillas. It's cheap and excellent. Expect a long line, not a lot of seating, flies, no a/c and a single stall unisex bathroom.  But those things only remove one star, because this little taco shack is worth the annoyances."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"just ok food, ok location. i really dont know why people think this place is so great. its really just ok. over priced, small portions and for as much money they make they dont invest any into the location. its kinda old and run down."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love this place.  I have been going for YEARS!  When ever I whirl through SB, it is a must to stop off at La Super-Rica Taqueria... You can see the tortillas being made right in front of your eyes.  The food is simple and consistently delicious.  The service is quick, courteous, take away.  It's cheap, it's tasty, it's easy.  What's not to love?  Go and enjoy!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I had discovered the joys of La Super-Rica 2 years ago on a trip through Santa Barbara wine country. Needless to say, when the opportunity to visit the same area presented itself recently, I jumped at the chance to eat here again. A couple Fridays ago, my boyfriend and I hit it at about 9:15 pm and the line was still out the door. It moved rather quickly, but it does help to get your beer immediately so you can enjoy it while you wait for the food. Remember to bring cash - there's a hard-to-find Wells Fargo ATM a couple miles up in the Rite-Aid parking lot if you forget.
The menu is so broad that sometimes a long line is a good thing. Since it was so late we only ordered a few things to share (but of course, extra hand-pressed tortillas). The tacos de costilla were good but the steak was a little bland. I had to drown it in some tomatillo salsa to get some flavor. The gorditas de frijoles sure made up for that though - the heat builds up slowly until your mouth is in flames! Thank Christ for that beer ;) Anyway, the tacos de adobado were the clear winners for us. The pork strips were seasoned perfectly and there was a lot of them! I do wish they had some style of carnitas but what they do have is really tasty. The dude behind the counter gave me some extra limes for my beer too. Muchas gracias! 
I could eat these tacos every day, but it's a damn good thing I live in SF!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Good food for the price but not worth the wait.  I have had better mexican food in Pasadena.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Honestly, this place is all hype. It's basic. Yea the tortillas are good because they're handmade, the guac is basic, the bistec is basic. The horchata was delicious though. I just wasn't impressed....chipotle is better."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,What Can I say.. Taco Stand in Santa Barbara! Check! 122 Reviews on Yelp Prior to me with a 4 star average! Check! Stand in a Long line! Check Julia Child (Yes the dead foodie) claims this is the best Mexican food! Check Prices are Definitely Santa Barbara at $2.95or $3.95 per! BIG Check! Quality of the Carne Asada - Chuleta de Puerco and Rajas con Queso tacos I had! TRIPLE CHECK and then some!! Its a Taqueria and its pretty good. Give them a try! Cheers!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love LA SUPERICA! !

Their tacos de rajas is one of my favorite foods on the planet.  (#6)

But you can not go wrong with anything on the menu.

When my wife and I lived in Stevenson Ranch, 2 or 3 times a year we would drive 2 1/2 hours round trip just to eat here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Driving the PCH I was told I had to stop at this place for ""The best Mexican in California""

I told the cashier to give me the top three tacos. All of them were amazing.

The line was long and took about 20 minutes. I was told by the locals that this was the normal wait time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,So I see why this place has such high ratings.there food is delicious....when the ingredients are fresh and it's made to order you have a winning combination. Even the tortillas are made to order. I would definitely come back ... Just one last things expect to wait in line for a minimum of 20 to 45 minutes. :)
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic tacos, with freshly made tortillas. Can't wait to go back. It's minimalist, but get a couple of meat tacos, try some guacamole, and pick up a few salsas and you'll be set."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Ignore those who cannot taste the superiority of this food. Just focus your attention on the killer home-made tortillas and delicious cheese veggies and meats.  So good.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This hit the spot.  Sunset Magazine had reviewed it a while back and we've wanted to try it and finally had the chance.  For me, the hand pressed tortillas make the tacos. I had the beef, chicken, and a special called tacos we calabacita (pork and zucchini...sounds strange but ah-ma-zing). My husband had a vegetable tamal that was oh so good.  The 2 of us had a meal with tip for under $30 which is hard to come by in this town."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I have been here over 100 times and its always legit! I reccomend going with whatever specials they are offering. so good, it can be a little confusing to order since its not your typical mexican cuisine, many dishes are small, the price is a good indicator of how much food you will get."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great place with fast and great quality food. Fortunately there was no line when I arrived. 

Love that the place is open air, but the doors need a screen door also. Way too many flies to enjoy sitting and eating. It wouldn't eliminate all of them but would at least help."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We loved this place despite having to wait in line for a bit. My suggestion is to go on a Monday.   All the names of the food items we ordered escape me but I enjoyed this melted cheese taco with red sauce and their guacamole.  I would skip the taco with grilled chicken, bell peppers and mushrooms because its not as unique as I expected.  I don't eat pork so my options were not as wide yet i got full on what I ordered.  This place is not cheap so don't be fooled.  The portions are tapas size so you end up ordering a ton of things which adds up your bill.  A plus for service and the friendly guy who takes your orders."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Why is there always a line!?? The portions are way too small and the food just isnt that great. Pretty flavorless as far as mexican food goes. They are open pretty late for SB which is cool, but not at all worth the price. If its down between taco bell and this place, go ahead and choose La Super-Rica. But I dont feel the need to ever come back personally."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,oh my God! Chile Relleno de Queso con crema w/ tomatillo salsa...Julie Child is rolling over in her grave!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"For the genre, this is hands-down the best taqueria in Santa Barbara. Not only a local favorite, we've even discussed this place with a winery employee in Cahors, France who worked in a central coast winery for an internship a decade earlier and still raves about the food here. Super-Rica is super-authentic and VERY tasty.  Fun to watch Mama make the tortillas in the window while you wait.  If prime time, be prepared for finding on-street parking and a lengthy wait that's certainly worth it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Yes, you need to wait in line for 30+ minutes, and they only accept cash. BUT, it's delicious, homemade, authentic, and very inexpensive. They appear to make each order as it's placed, and I think that's why the line moves so slowly. And that ""made to order"" freshness can't be beat. The seasoning is perfect in each menu item, and the salsa is homemade and sabrosa. The front counter people are muy agradable and don't rush you in any way. I also like their coffee. They make it with plioncillo (Mexican brown sugar). The most expensive item on the menu was around $6, but dishes generally cost $2.50-3.50. Two people can easily get stuffed for less than $20 (with drinks). Real Mexican food at an affordable price is well worth your wait, and it's inexpensiveness justifies their cash only policy."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The food is delicious and FRESH here. The tortillas are homemade. The simple taco de chuleta tastes amazing with just Pico de Gallo. If you are super hungry, have the Super Rica Special!! You will get good service and delicious food...always..."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,The steak does not have that fatty flavor- it's bland but much healthier. The best is the cheese infused dishes. Paid $36 for 3 people... it adds up quickly. The dishes are small ... so we ordered a lot of food.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Excellent and unique Mexican food from this long-lasting restaurant. We love their vegetable chili relleno and special enchiladas -- both which are specials. 

Be aware that food is super good and cheap -- but cash only, wait to order and get served can be very slow. It is typically a one hour wait from time we arrive to receiving food. Relax and talk to people because wait is worth it. The kitchen is tiny and they can't keep up."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Peoples taste's and allegiances differ quite a bit.  However, anyone who does not give this place at least a 3.5 is just trying to have a contrarian nature to the popularity of this place.

It may have a line up the street...the seeting is serviceable at best...the prices are a dollar or two more than the average mexican place....anyone who does not know this going in needs to stop skipping their anxiety meds.

The quality of meat is outstanding.
Watching tortillas being made as I order is a huge plus.

I have heard many people rave about their family recipe tamales that is only used a couple of times a year like it is some special treat.  Absolutely no tamale can campare to the light, fluffy texture of their vegetarian tamales....and I am a carnivore by nature.

Brave the line...who knows, you might actually get to meet someone interesting.  If you want food the moment your stomach starts with a whisper of a rumble, then complain about the wait, don't waste a space in this line; go to Taco Bell where you belong."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I have been pretty disappointed my two most recent visits here. The food is excellent, and that is consistent. However, the customer service definitely leaves something to be desired. On my most recent visit, I discovered a small shard of glass in my food, potentially quite dangerous. I brought it to the attention of the cashier (owner?) in a very friendly and discreet way. I was not looking to make a stink about it, but to alert him to the problem so he could address it for the sake of his other customers. I felt like he brushed me off, and he made no effort to make things right. No offer to make me another dish, let alone refund me for the food I was no longer interested in eating. I used to stop at this place every single time I passed through Santa Barbara, but I doubt I'll be back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,They have some amazing unique mexican food. As well as very fast service with very polite employees
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,The tacos are well made. The tortillas are super fresh because they are made in house.  The chicken is grilled and not greasy but not well seasoned.  It took about 20 minutes for just two tacos with guacamole and an horchata... kinda long a simple order. Also I'm not sure because I'm used to San Fernando Valley prices but this dish cost 9.06...  kinda expensive.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Read about this place in AAA magazine and just so happened I was going to be in SB. Arrived around 3 on a Friday and waited 15 min. I heard the line was down the street at noon. Got the tacos de bistec and chuleta. Both meats were well seasoned and nicely cooked but it was the handmade tortillas that really impressed. For the price and quality this place can't be beat.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Came here on a Saturday night and tried the Super Rica Especial #16 which was delicious  . The marinated pork combined with melted cheese and grilled peppers was enough to fill me up. On top of that, they make their own tortillas! 

We were lucky to arrive when the line was short, but as we were eating, we saw the line extend outside the store front. Plan ahead to spend some time here, but it is definitely worth it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Really cool little place in beautiful Santa Barbara. It looked super small from the street and had a line out the door, but the seating area is roomy and pleasant and gets good natural light. The menu is much more expansive and gourmet than any taqueria I've been too. Prices are very fair. I LOVE that they handmake their own corn tortillas- this makes a HUGE difference to me. Tacos were delicious. Great lunch place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Still the best. Each time i visit Santa Barbara, it is my must-stop. I went last week and was in heaven once again. It isn't just crazy delicious, fresh, simple food... the staff were incredibly friendly with everyone (and there were some annoying patrons). They smiled endlessly and when I asked about cilantro in the guacamole, the man replied cheerfully 'we can make it for you without!'. I don't get that kind of fresh food & service at restaurants 20x the price. And those tortillas... i don't know how they're so amazing but they are. My mouth is still watering. Thanks, La Super Rica! I fell in love with you as a teenager and still love you in my 30's! I'm counting this restaurant as one of my top reasons for wanting to move to Santa Barbara. Yep. I'm serious."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"No. I can't believe this place is real it's so damn delicious. I'm literally in shock.

The prices are amazing as well. So cheap - cash only. I had the #10 and it was delicious! The chorizo was lean and not too spicy. Authentic.

If you have a big appetite make sure to order at least 2 dishes - the portions were smaller than expected!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is so yummy and so consistent Thank God!  I have been coming here for 24 years and it is worth the long line every time!  Even in the rain! It goes by fast, usually...  It sure isn't fancy by any means, it's cash ONLY and you prob have to wait for a table but it is worth it ALL I promise!  I love the specials the most: tamales, the chili rellenos (not battered and fried), posole, etc.  Everything is so friggin good! I would rather eat cold take-out from here than ANY other Mex place here in SB honestly."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Outstanding food; totally casual, friendly eating environment. This is as authentic Mexican food as you could ever ask for."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I really, really wanted to love this place since it's been highly rated by Yelpers and celebs (hello, Katy Perry!) alike, but I was so disappointed! my friends and I stopped by this tiny little taco place one night and we were STARVED. Luckily, the menu is large so we all found things that sounded good to us. 

Overall we ended up with a side of guac, the #16, the #7, and a tamale. The pictures online made it look like the portions were huge (as Mexican food in America is usually), but our poor stomachs were very wrong. The plates were very small and just didn't have that much flavor. The homemade tortillas were definitely the strong part of the meal - very fluffy and warm. However, everything else was just mediocre and I don't think I would return. 

It's a very casual setting, so good for groups, but the restaurant doesn't have much light so going after sunset can be tricky."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We initially tried to go to another very well rated restaurant down the block but after a day of fishing at the Goleta pier we figured this spot would be best suited.  I had also seen the reviews and the Júlia child story plus the very long line outside convinced us to go in.  The hand made tortillas were really nice but have to admit all the build up about their tacos was too much because they were good but not mind blowing.  I had better tacos in the Bay Area and other places.  The Chile relleno was one of the most interesting and delicious that I've had in a restaurant.  Also, asked for some fresh jalapeños and the guy passing out orders turn to what I assume is the owner to see if he could give me some and then I was told that they did not have any, really?? I would have paid for them if you were so worried about that but that's like telling me there is no sand at the beach!!!!  Not impressed and we tried just about one of everything but again was expecting amazing tacos and hey were good but not what I expected."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Incredible tacos. The number 16 is what I would go with 10 times out of 10.

The venue is cute but just know that there is pretty much a long line from 11-5! A very popular joint. Even if you are visiting Santa Barbara for just an hour, it's a must stop."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Worth the wait. Best mexican food I have ever had. Order chile con queso, chorizo tacos, rajas, and chile relleno. All the food was amazing and their pico was so fresh and tasty. We had to wait 45 minutes on a sunday around 3 pm, but it was totally worth it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"No frills. Great authentic food. 

You'll know about the lines before you get there, so once you're prepared for that it's not a problem. The food will not woo fine diners, but it's solid, such good value and it's more about the overall experience. 

The busy kitchen is part of the joy of this place and watching the parts of the puzzle come together in this kitchen based choreography is awesome. An absolute joy."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"By far the best mexican food in Santa Barbara.  My girlfriend and I went there Sept 6 and ordered 7 plates of food for about $30.  They have something for everyone.  I do have to correct some of the other reviewers.  This style of Mexican food comes from the ""poorer"" side of Mexico.  They tend to use a lot of vegetables and fish because its cheap to grow and harvest.  I recommend this  to restaurant everyone.  This is authentic Mexican Food!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"SO DELICIOUS. Hole in the wall. I definitely missed it the first time I tried to find it-- there's not big sign. It's a turquoise little building on the corner. 

Line was long and wait for food was 15-20 minutes at dinner time! 

CASH ONLY! Be prepared, friends. No one wants to lose their precious palace in line and have to wait all over again. 

Cashier I encountered was very kind- saw him patiently answering people's questions while waiting for food. 

I got 2 steak tacos and they load up their tacos with meat! Big pieces of tender steak, not little chopped up little pieces with hard tendon and tough meat. Their tortillas are HANDMADE, which probably contributes to the wait time for food. 

They have a salsa bar with pico de gallo, red sauce (spicy) and green sauce (very citrusy and fresh). Ask kitchen for limes through the window!

Wait is worth it for the food!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Lots of tapas. We had like three each. The guy in the front is super nice, and will answer all of your questions, but I'd say if it looks interesting, just order it, because you don't have a lot of time in front of the menu. Cash only. Get a spot in the next room. Often there's a line out the door, so if you drive by and don't see one, go for it!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Though we were full, decided to check this place out and get a couple tacos because of a referral from a coworker. At $2.50 a pop, I got the Adobado and Bisteca tacos. I'm almost always a steak fan, but the adobado was hands down better. Meat was great, flavor was great, and their salsas are top notch. I was a bit disappointed in the bisteca taco, as the meat was a bit less flavorful and seemed too much on the well done side.

Fairly casual atmosphere (plus it was pouring when we went), service was fine, no complaints. Short wait on a Monday at noon. Check it out if you're in the area. Recommended!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fun experience, but I'm not going to be a regular. First of all, I live in Palm Beach, not Santa Barbara. But if I lived there I'd take out-of-towners for the rough-and-tumble experience. I respect the fact they make their own tortillas, but you'd better know what you'd want before taking a crack at ordering. The guacamole was good, but they don't have chips. A lot can be forgiven. This place is cheap!  Buds, for example, are $2.50. Entrees are $4-5 bucks. Definitely needed Tums before bed. 

Fun place, great experience."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Not bad, but not great! The tacos are quite simple thus need to be ordered with some guacamole and beans. If you have to wait long for the food, I would pass and go to another taqueria as there are plenty in town!!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Seriously amazing!!  The long lines are completely worth your time.  I love the food.  I dream about it. DO NOT MISS the opportunity to try the super rica especial.  Your taste buds will thank you.  The tacos and rajas are delicious as well.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is my favorite Mexican place in Santa Barbara. My wife's family has been going there for more than 25 years and I discovered it thanks to them. I've tested the whole menu and there's not one thing i didn't enjoy. This is quite affordable, which makes it even better."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"-1 star for the wait time in taking order. 
4 stars for awesome food and dirt cheap price.
Loved their specials.
Taco de hongos, taco de pollo, chorizo, rajas, horchata, jamica were my favorties."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I'd been looking forward to this meal for many years. I'd heard such wonderful things.
I was underwhelmed. The tortillas were homemade and very good. Everything else was just OK. Nothing special. I'd place this in the lower end of good Mexican food.
It wasn't even the best Mexican food I've eaten this week."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I yearn for this place.  I lived 2 blocks from this place for 2 years when I was at school in Santa Barbara, I went at least a few times a week.  Now that I live so far from this magical place I find myself dreaming of the hand made tortillas pressed mere moments before ordering.  Everything on the menu is good, beer is cheap @ near grocery store prices, cash only.  soooo gooooodddd, I must go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The roasted peppers and cheese on homemade tortillas were excellent. I'll be thinking about them for a long time. The guac was good too.

The beans with bacon were less so - I wish I had gotten the artery clogging bacon and cheese ""dip"" instead. It looked good when I saw someone else order it.

Also, the horchata was AMAZING. So tasty.

But the wait was quite long and the service seemed pretty inconsistent and disorganized. But it was worth it. I was waiting and then enjoying food with friends. :)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Wow. We went at 3pm and the line was a 30 minute wait, so go on a day that you are feeling rather patient. It is well worth the wait.

I ordered the pork, peppers and tortillas combo, boyfriend got the chicken with bell pepper and onion, and we shared the quesadilla and chile relleno. The chile relleno was the special of the day and was amazing with potato, zucchini, green beans, cheese and tomato stuffed inside of a long, deep fried chile. The pork pastilla dish I got was unreal- the flavor of the pork was fantastic, and the homemade corn tortillas had the best flavor and texture I've ever had in a corn tortilla. The maza was so fresh and you can see them making the tortillas and grilling everything on the grill, which is really nice. 

Their pico de gallo and guacamole rock. This place is out of this world and very unique style of food. I wish we would have gotten the tamale special. Their mexican rice is also fabulous and not too greasy or heavy. The quesadilla was rather bland and was the one thing we probably would pass on in the future."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Come after 1PM on a Sunday and the line is only slightly out the door.  But the line quickly built up and remained steady even after we had ordered and eaten.  Just be smart and curve the line around the building...there are some nut jobs who think leading the line out to the street where cars drive on is a smart idea.
Everything is made to order here.  Yes, this is Julia Child's favorite taco joint.  The tortilla ninjas only make your tortillas when you order your food...fresh tortillas with tacos is not overrated.  They have some house specials including an agua fresca (watermelon for my visit).
We got an assortment of items to share.  Prices are super reasonable considering it's hand made and house made food.  I loved anything with the adorbado pork...the taco or the quesadilla...the melted cheese they use is super melty and velvety.  The fresh pico de gallo and rojo or verde salsas were great accompaniments...and not as spicy as they look.  The salsa verde worked great with any cheesy dishes.
It was a pretty cool experience.  The meats were well seasoned and well-cooked.  Service was very friendly."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I'm a SoCal native and tacos are my favorite food so I've eaten my fair share of Mexican food in my life. This is by far my favorite spot. I remember going as a kid and even though a cheese quesadilla was all I got the tortillas are amazing. I always make a point to go when driving through Santa Barbara. The #16 is my fav but guac is also great and like I said those tortillas. Most everything comes with them. Totally awesome SoCal 25 years ago vibe with plastic chairs and cheap table seating but it's the perfect ambience.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"La Super-Rica is a great take out or quick sit down place. It has the best mexican food ever! Homemade and fresher than fresh, they make it right when you order! Very fast and great quality! I totally recommend la Super-Rica : )"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"WE came here because Los Algaves was closed for fourth of July. This is a legit taco place. Its also considered a local eatery and it was bustling with people. We had to wait in line for about 20 minutes. We ordered the chorizo quesadilla (DELICIOUS, IT WAS GRILLED TO ABSOLUTE PERFECTION) and couple tacos with different types of meat such as the adobada, al pastor, and steak. They were all good. The tortilla is also made fresh daily which makes a difference. Where I come from (los angeles), taco eateries are numerous so I'm pretty picky when it comes to my mexican food but I really liked this place. Highly recommend if you are in the Santa Barbara area.


P.S. YOU WON""T REGRET THIS. YOU MUST MUST MUST order their watermelon fresca juice. Its pretty much watermelon juice but it is so icy and refreshing and a GREAT compliment to the spicy meal!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Best place for soft tacos in SB hands down! Everyone pretty much said it right here so I wont re-post the same stuff. If you happen to go, you gotta try their choriqueso. The chorizo is in chunks and not grounded, and they make their own tortillas fresh. Great place, and always crowded! Oh yea, the owner is a great guy too!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,My gf and I were looking for authentic Mexican food and we certainly found it.  This place has a wide variety of tacos ranging from spicy beans to chorizo.  We tried 8 items off of the menu and everything but the spicy bean gordita was delectable.  The best thing we ate was the plain ole quesadilla.  I would say one of the best I've ever had.  The pork steak tacos are also very good.  I must say I was a little bit shocked at how pricey it was given the hole in the wall atmosphere.  The horchata was to die for.  The owner was very friendly and added to an overall positive experience.  I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.  Excellent food!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Thank you Yelpers for helping my husband and I find this place.  We had:

#6 (THE BEST!!!) Rajas
#9 Quesadilla
#11 (My least favorite...greasy, fatty and surprisingly no flavor) Lomito Suizo
#18 Guacamole 
#20 Gordita de Frijol

I want to go back tomorrow just to get #6 again!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place ROCKS!  The food is excellent and authentic.  Its a great place to eat too if one prefers vegan food.  The ambiance is down to earth and very chill.  Expect good flavor, long lines and affordable prices.  P.S the carne asada tacos aren't as flavorful as the usual carna asada tacos and I can attest to that since I am Mexican American, however this place still gets 5 stars because the rest of the menu is superb, besides I am warning y'all now so don't hold them against it, hahaha.
Bon Appetit!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Visiting SB, and hungry for some tacos.  Read your guidebook, and everyone keeps squealing about some ""hole-in-the-wall"" that J. Child loved.  Perfect, right?  No!

After braving a half hour line, and another half hour waiting for your food to ""arrive,"" what your mouthwatering taste buds receive is some bland, cold Mexi-Cali cuisine that sooner resembles cafeteria food, than the layered, flavorful, spicy Mexican food you crave.

How do you spell overrated?"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Man this is the best mexican food I ever had in cali! Everything is super flavorful. Lots of items you don't see often in mex restaurants in LA. It's a hole in the wall but worth the drive up from LA. Or go to the annual SB seafood festival in october and stuff yourself on fresh uni & oysters then visit la super rica. What a great day!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I'll have to give this place a 3 to balance out the mind-blowingly-glowing reviews. The food was pretty darn good (though, it's not _really_ Mexican... it's... something else), but the line outside in the sun was what I remember most vividly."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic food! You can tell how fresh the ingredients are in each dish. Be warned that this isn't exactly a ""romantic"" restaurant, but if you can live with a halogen-lit, tarp covered room, then you'll find some of the most delicious mexican food you'll ever taste in SB."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Came with  family and we ordered a range of items. Everyone really enjoyed the food, but take note: the size of each item (at least what we all ordered) was kinda small. Think of it as small plates. If you're looking to really chow down, be ready to spend $10 or more each. Then there's the line: We waited about 15 minutes, and that was after 2 pm. There are no paper menus, only a big board where you order; that causes delays while newbies decide. It all starts with homemade corn tortillas, a great base. Then pick your best topping combination and enjoy!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My friends and I go on a retreat to Santa Barbra once a year, and every year, I look forward to our first stop at La Super-Rica Taqueria! Always very delicious, and I salivate over their hand made tortillas! Yum! Reasonably priced for the quality of food, and definitely worth the wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We came here for lunch on Saturday about 5 minutes before it opened, and there was already a line! The food here is always good, and the most expensive item on the menus is about $6. Awesome value for a good lunch."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My must go-to place whenever I'm around Santa Barbara.  Last night didn't disappoint at all and hit the spot with spicy pork and beef tacos & the special Chile Relleno and a couple horchatas, mmm...... Good thing I don't live in SB or I'd be in serious trouble!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"SO GOOD! got there around 11:30 on a Thursday, only a couple people in line - yay! I had the bean gordita ... didn't really like it, it was very bland. I also had the pasilla pepper and cheese between 2 corn tortillas .... YUM!!! The guacamole is also very tasty, and its not often that you find a place that makes HOMEMADE corn tortillas to order! Score! Oh, and their horchata and aqua frescas are FANTASTIC, not to be missed. We will definitely be back again to try more :)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,stopd by on way back to LA.  No Parking but Food was delicious. Excellent #16.  Authentic Mexican flavor.  Thanks Adam Richman!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Any chance I get I visit this place.

Menu is different than a typical Mexican place.  It takes a while to figure out what everything really is.

Hand made as you order tortillas are the basis for all of the goodness.

Go early or late to avoid the lines."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"As far as cheap 'taco' joints go - this is a 4 star version. That said, this isn't a taco joint at all. In fact, one of the best things on the menu is Pozole - a deep red chili and pork broth full of hominy and stewed pieces of pork butt. Topped with some chopped raw onions, a couple slices of avocado and a wedge of lime. Genius. This is what those in the know get.

The veggie tamale is pretty tasty also - as a reviewer below said, full of corn, onions, chayote, etc. with a big spoon of a creme sauce on top. I also like the simple dried beef tacos that come with a guacamole/tomatillo sauce. Their 'special' - the no. 16 or 17, not sure, is billed as a pasilla stuffed with pork and cheese, but turns out to be not a relleno but chopped peppers and pork with melted cheese on top. Good, but a bit of a disappointment.

The lines are huge at lunch. Just get there before noon for sure. Or on a Sunday for a late breakfast. You won't stand in line, and you'll get a table in no time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Oh my dear god. This is the best mexican food I have ever had. Ever. I had the vegetarian tamales and the pork enchilada special. The enchiladas were topped with guac and radishes, and let me tell you, I have a newfound appreciation for radishes. I came here for lunch at 1:30 on a friday and clearly the gods were smiling upon me, because there was no line. I paid about $14 for my two items, surprisingly pricey for La Super-Rica, but it was well worth it. Do not pass through SB without eating here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Just super simple Mexico City style tacos.

My fave was bacon and cheese.  Simply outrageous.

The poblano pork and cheese was great as well.

All house made tortillas.

Must visit."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,I wouldn't rate this as one of the good places to eat in Santa Barbara. Not good Mexican food. Just dry mixed meat and flavorless food.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"oohhh my favorite place in the world!!! Everytime I'm in town it's a must I stop here for lunch ,,,, it's a little small place but worth the wait . It is always has a long line where people are waiting for like 20 minute in line but it's so worth it ,,, everything on their menu is delicious and freshly made  , my favorite is # 17 and there guacamole is fresh and soooooo good ... Gotta stop here when ur in Santa Barbara ... Hey if Julia Child loved this place I'm sure all will too .... Sorry didn't take any pics this last time ...next time I will"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,So good.  Get anything that has cheese on it and the horchata (best I've ever tasted).  Enjoyed the super-rica especiale and guacamole as well.  I would say 2-3 orders per person.  Ambiance is total hole in the wall but I appreciate the fact that there is a covering above the seating area.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Food was average. However, the tortillas were the best tortillas id ever had. Very long line, tortillas were worth it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I went to school in SB and had no idea this place even existed. 

Venue - pretty small. It has a little taqueria feel. So, don't get super dressed up or anything - it's a casual kind of place (my cup of tea). Customer service was good. You order at a window, pick up your food at another window, then you find your seat.

We ordered the fish tamale, beef taco, & a cheese suiza. The fish tamale was my favorite by far! I've never had a fish tamale and theirs was splendid. Just the right amount of fish and cheese to top it off. Yum! Beef taco was just ok. And I can't even remember much about the chicken suizas.

Only negative thing I can say, is that we waited a while for our food. I think it's because they make their own tortillas or something.  We waited over half an hour for 3 dishes, but the wait is definitely well worth.

I would definitely come back here for their fish tamale though. Yummy!

Just a suggestion - go early. Or expect to wait an hour or two...this place is always packed!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Good stuff here.  My taste buds for tacos are a little spoiled coming from LA and SD, so I'd like to think i know a good taco when it hits my tongue.  First off, any place that makes fresh tortillas, is a winner with me.  Once you have fresh hand made tortillas, the other stuff is like cardboard.  This place can get busy during the dinner rush so be prepared to wait about 20 min to get your order in.  But not to worry, once your order is in, it's out in front of you in no time.  The wait is b/c of people trying to make up their minds on what they want.  The menu is pretty straight forward.  I got the Super Rica Especial, had a roasted pepper stuffed with cheese, tasty pork, and 3 hand made tortillas ($6) and a can of coke ($1.25?).  What I really wanted was a corona, but I was borrowing cash so didn't want to burn money that wasn't really mine.  So on that note, it's a CASH only place, so be ready.  Park is on the street, but there's plenty of it, cause it's off the main strip of traffic.  Good stuff.  If i were a local, I'd be a regular here for sure.  It's got a good community vibe to it as well."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,All of the food there is amazing because it is completely handmade. You can watch them prepare the tortillas. Often they have a pitcher of hibiscus tea that is not on the menu. My favorite item there is the taco con rajas.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A little shack on Milpas.  You stand on line... you order... you wait... and then... and then... Mmmm... Amazing carnitas... melted cheese... peppers... guacamole... Whatever I order here, it is always so tasty and obviously well priced.  A true classic!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Fame well-deserved. The fresh tortillas melt in your mouth! We went back for dinner after lunch there earlier on the same day :)
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Everything I ate was delicious. I would recommend getting a few different things and trying them.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I came here at a random hour and the line was so long and crazy. For that wait, I thought the tacos were okay, nothing super amazing. It may also be a preference too that the tortillas, although handmade, reminded me too much of a tamale consistency/flavor. I guess I'm just a white-washed taco lover. I also found their meat to be dry and on the more bland side.

Food took awhile to come out... and I do love hole in the wall places, but this place was super dingy and DIRTY. So many flies everywhere, trash to your left and right... etc. They ran out of sauce /pico de gallo (and they weren't placed on top of ice if I recall correctly). Did anyone else notice their health score on yelp is 55/100? 

Perhaps I've been spoiled by Mexican food in San Diego and LA so I thought this was okay and I probably would only go if there wasn't a long wait."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Dry meat dishes. Long lines. The only thing going for them is that years ago Julia Childs made mention.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"These are the best tacos i've ever had!!!!
will update asap.

I must take pics next i go up to Santa Barbara!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Went to this place w/my mom last month for the first time due the high review rate on yelp while we were in SB! Had high expectations for the food and was kinda of disappointed. 

When we arrived the line was out the door which we waited about an hour just finally get to the window to place our order.  Then once I placed my ordered, I still waited 30 mins more to wait for my food....by this time we were starving! We ordered tacos, but there were not prepared like your typical tj style tacos. Its just handmade tortillas and the meat is overloaded-by its self.  They have a tiny salsa bar that you can serve on your tacos, (mild/med green/red hot salsa) but that's about it.

Other than that, there is really nothing that spectular about this place considering the amount of waiting we had to invest to get our food.  The place has a few tables, based on first come first serve basis, the roof in the sitting area is a plastic covering-nothing elegant, very old and humble place.  The owners/employees, not your typical friendly/welcoming business.  Honestly, I've been to better hole in wall mexican food spots, this place is ok-ay the food is decent, but its  nothing to rave about....however,  I wouldnt come back again."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This place is a cheap (but delicious) restaurant for lunch or dinner. The Choriza Especial (melted cheese with chorizo and tortillas) cannot get any better. It doesn't get any greater than this!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Okay team.....we were super stoked to go here because everyone was amped on this being amazing. I really don't think that this is worth the wait. We got a bunch of items and it was all meh. We are still confused why people wait in line. Their tortillas are medium good but fresh which is nice. Dry tacos and bland all around. If you douse it in sauce you'll survive. Good luck kids
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"more like 3.5 stars.
Apparently this is located in famous American french cuisine chef Julia Childs' neighborhood.
The line was out the door and around when we got there at 2.30, took 30 minutes to get to the checkout window, but the food came out fairly fast. When we left around 4, line was still just as long.

food is interesting: you haven't had mexican food like that before: one thing they do is the tacos con queso come in a slab of baked cheese, I liked that quite a bit.
I wouldn't say the food was out of this world, but it was definitely a new experience. 
Nice seating area though there's flies.

Worth the wait, at least the first time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Read the reviews and decided we needed to try it.  It is much better and different from the standard chain mexican resturants, but it is does not measure up to all the hype.  The homemade tortillas are great, but everything else is ok.  The beans did not have much flavor and the pork was just average.  Maybe this is the best in Santa Barbara, but it is not the best in the West. We only eat at ""authentic"" Mexican resturants and found much better food at other places. 
Few helpful hints if you go
1. There is always a line
2. They only take cash
3. They are closed on Wednesdays"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Street style Mexican food at it's best.... it's a locals favorite that is know throughout the area as being one of the best. 

Just GO!!! As Arnold would say.... Do it... Do it now!! 

Beware.. most anytime you visit La Supa Rica there will be a line, most often times, a line out the door, and down the street... your patience's will be rewarded."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great Mexican food, simple, cheap, no thrills. We usually take it to go. Busy and not always the cleanest."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,its one of those places that a community is built around. Cheap and easy. Like my women.. serious tamale.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place was awesome.  Their tacos could not have been fresher or more delicious.  You read the menu while you wait in line.  Yes, there is a long line because this place is amazing.  Their food is superb.

Our group tried just about everything off the menu.  We had pork, beef, veggie, and a special.  We did it up right.  Nothing was just good; everything was great. Each taco was unique.  The flavors were right on the button.

Some of the best tacos I have ever tried.  

It's a simple place where you chose your food, pay for it, and then find a seat.  Their seating area is spacious, bright, and sunny.  When they call your number, you eat.  The only real problem is it's just a bit too far to try everything else again soon.

I will dream about their mushroom taco."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Seems to be a local's landmark of a spot here.  Lots of people who look like they've been coming here for years, as well as lots of people coming in for the first time, studying the menus etc...

Food was good, but not necessarily stellar.  Maybe it's because we have a lot of great Mexican food available in LA we've been a little bit spoiled, but nothing stand out here.  Parking was pretty easy to find on the streets.  

The guy who took our order was friendly, answering our questions, and making suggestions as well.  No rush at all despite the ever present line here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"mmmmmnnn. not sure if it was the excitement or it was for real but I'll give it 5 for now! when I go again we will see but for my virgin time I was 5 star happy even with the flies!

line wasn't too bad maybe 4 or 5 peeps.
ordered a shit ton I think it was about 30 bucks! think 20 bucks worth of food at taco bell so you can get an idea!

special chili relleno in a cream sauce...YUM!
super rica special- OMG my fave! it was pepperlicious!
veggie taco-mmmmn
shit what else did we get? an enchilada maybe? a beer and tea but there was more food I know!

all I know is I was so happy and yummified! the homemade tortillas were so good as was all the food! neat outdoor but indoor seating area. had some flies but I think they added to my experience!

cheap, tasty, authentic mexican food. go for sure! it's worth the wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"For my entire existence (28 years old), I have gone to Super Rica every week. I always order what ever the special is with my favorites being: The Vegetarian Tamale, The Chile Relleno (with white cream sauce), Sopes, Tacos Desebrada, and the Queso de Casquela. I recommend studying the menu ahead of time to know their specials so you can make a point to go on your favorite day. I always choose the Jamaica or Horchata to drink. Super Rica is a unique experience unlike anything else that caters to a world class pallet of flavors. Their sauces are so unique! A Santa Barbara staple!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This was a tasty meal.  Good, but not very special.  Guacamole was excellent, chorizo was good, and beef lacked flavor."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Loved all the taco choices.  Shared the following: the grilled pork, the tri-tip with onions and peppers, and the roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese.  All good.  Super casual, short line, plenty of seating."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What hasn't already been said about Julia Child's favorite taqueria?  Great food, updated with fresh (and cheesy--in a good way) options.  Weight Watchers won't endorse this joint, but if you're gonna clog the arteries, this is the Mexican joint to do so.  Higher priced than the average taqueria, but well worth it.  An added bonus is you'll probably run into a celebrity or two.  Last time I was there, Diane Keaton pulled up with her mom.  This is one place A-listers don't mind slummin'."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Amazingly fresh and authentic Mexican cuisine.  All the workers are extremely friendly and the food is worth waiting in the long lines for.  We enjoyed everything we ordered.  The fresh salsas are great.  The dark red one will blow you away if you aren't careful.  If I lived nearby, I'd be a frequent visitor."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Stood in line 45 minutes. The person taking the orders was also dishing up food which is why it took so long (and is that sanitary-he handled the money too). Totally unimpressed. And the reason Julia Child said it was her favorite is because she didn't want to insult any of her chef friends and they all knew she hated Mexican food. First and last time here.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Apparently this place is one of Julia Child's favorite Mexican joints. At first I thought my friend said Julia Roberts which didn't interest at me but when we got there, there was a pretty long line out the door so you know it has to be good.

The staff was really friend and the food was really good. I love that they serve fresh handmade tortillas. That makes all the difference right there. The only thing that wasn't so great was the marinated steak, it was kind of bland and it wasn't really tendor but I really enjoyed everything else. Well worth the wait."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Yummmmm...  My girlfriend took me to this place because the Mexican joint she wanted to eat at was closed.  I think we were both a little surprised that this was ""the backup.""  The servings are small, but ""super rica"" and not too pricey.  Awesome home made tortillas, and cafe de olla.  Try the tortilla stuffed with spicy beans and the chorizo with melted cheese!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Seriously good food‼ cold beer and quick service we enjoyed the many choices of tacos like pork, beef and chorizo.  Would definitely recommend for cheap eats."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place was decent.  Not the best tacos or Mexican I have ever had.  I didn't really enjoy the wait and probably wouldn't wait in that long line ever again especially for the smallish portions.  But the food is fresh and they are constantly refilling the salsa station.  

I went here based on seeing it on Man Vs. Food. So I followed in the footsteps of the host and got the  La Super-Rica Especial -- roasted poblano stuffed with cheese with marinated pork on top of tortillas.  I washed it all down with the watermelon juice, which was a thick watermelon drink, but moderately enjoyable.  

Worth a try once, expect long lines and small portions.  Likely you will have to order more than one thing.  But if you're not super hungry, it is a great place for a snack.  You can get in and out of here pretty cheap as well."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"YUM! That's most of my review! Ha. I was in Santa Barbara with two of my best girlfriends for the weekend. One had been, the other had heard great things about Super-Rica. I could eat Mexican food every single day so I was excited to try it. I had the adobado taco and the frijoles. The frijoles were so amazing, my mouth is watering right now. It was almost like a whole bean soup with pieces of bacon. How could you go wrong with bacon in anything right? I would definitely go again next time I am in SB!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Prepare yourself for a line and the best lunch you'll have in Santa Barbara. We got the rajas taco, chicken enchiladas, guacamole, and tamale for the two of us which was perfect. The rajas = a must.

I was initially drawn to this place because of the Julia Child recommendation. Who would mess with that??? GO."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"In the past few years, I've had horchatas from here every time I'm visiting Santa Barbara. My most recent trip was the first time I've tried their food. First off, it is one of those places where you order in line and then wait for your order to be called. There is decent amounts of seating in a well-covered area adjacent to the shack. The major standout part about this place is the huge portion size! For example, a ""taco"" consists of two pieces of fresh tortilla and a plate full of meat and toppings! Definitely consider this, as you will be fine ordering one less portion. 

I ordered non-vegetarian pozolo with hominy, avocado, lime wedges, and radish, which is a menudo-like dish. It's sort of comfort food-ish without being overly salty, which was exactly what I was looking for. My cousin and I shared a large horchata, and the serving size was actually much smaller than I anticipated (a medium-sized Dixie cup) with ice. Granted, the horchata is extremely concentrated and a bit on the sweeter side, but I still expected the drink portion to be larger. I did like how cinnamon-y it was though. You can ask for water where you pick up your order. 

Overall, this seems like a very involved family business. The tiny kitchen is filled with people doing various jobs. I was pleasantly surprised that one woman was literally getting the dough, flattening it, and cooking it into hot tortillas. All the workers were very polite and nice, and service was decently quick considering it was during a weekend dinner rush. If you are looking for a quick and super casual taco joint in Santa Barbara, this is it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,You can tell the quality of the food is good but I felt like every dish (we had eight different things) was lacking something.  Mainly salt.  But I say definitely try it.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Yum yum! I've eaten here both times I've been to SB and both times it met my expectations. This time my friend ordered the frijol (beans), which were AMAZING. Whole beans (not mashed or soupy) in the bean broth, which includes bacon among other seasonings. Yum yum. I had the adobado taco, which was good. My friend's asada looked good too. I doubt I will ever skip this place on a trip to SB!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We heard all the hype about this place and decided to make a special stop on our way to San Francisco from LA. I figured after seeing it on a couple TV shows and how it was a favorite of Julia Child I should give it a shot. Talk about anticlimactic. I've had better Mexican food served out of taco carts and trucks. I'm dead serious. I've grown up with real Mexican food all my life and I'm always searching for a great taco place that I can frequent. This is not the place. It's okay but nothing to write home about, yet alone put on TV. 

I had a couple of the tacos, including the carne asada and adobada, and a chile con queso which seemed like it really wanted to be a chile relleno. I love a good chile relleno but the white sauce thing I'd never seen, and it totally didn't work. All our food was lackluster, except the fresh guacamole. But I can get that anywhere. There are many, way better, hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants out there. This is California after all. (See Photos)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place was quaint, and the tortillas were tasty. They were hand crafted and grilled before our eyes, so that was a nice touch. I had specifically stopped here on the way  down to LA because I had heard it was written up so many times, and it was Julia Child's favorite taco shop. However, this place couldn't hold a candle to most places in East LA or Hollywood taco shops. The meat was very chewy in my beef tacos, though flavorful. Also, it was ridiculously expensive. I got two beef tacos with avocado sauce and it was $5.50. Compare that to the $1.25 lengua tacos I had the other day that  were quite delicious in Holllywood. The service was slow and and borderline rude. Sure, I guess you are paying a premium for the hand crafted tacos and Santa Barbara rent prices, but  we were sorely disappointed that we drove 10 minutes out of our way to go to this place when we can get tastier, cheaper tacos at most places in LA. also, this meal was followed by a terrible stomachache, so this probably lowered my rating by another star."

How is it that the town of Santa Barbara gets a place like this.

On our way home and being that I was travelling with my Best buddy. Who happens to be a Mexican Boy.  I decided that La Super Rica was the place he just had to try.  One look at the freakin line an my pal said.  These better be the best f@cking Tacos I ever had John.  

We waited for an hour before we even placed our order.  The tacos come plain!  I mean really plain.  Nothing but 2 homemade tortillas that the lady is handmaking right in the kitchen and the meat.   Then you add the salsas,  Green, red or Pico de Gallo.  Either way the meat is just so perfectly cooked, juicy and tender that the tacos do scream puro Mexicano.  We also got another form of taco that I would have to say is a cross between a quesadilla and a taco.  Delicious!!!   But the very best taco they have has to be the raja con queso tacos.  Roasted Pasilla peppers and jack cheese all melted together.  Damn Good Man!!!
The Meat
The Tortillas
The Salsas

100% Mexican Taqueria.

Give them a try!

Wine Trip Over!

Cheers!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Yes...its that good.  Who says food has to be expensive to be good?  Been here many a many times....Julia was right.  Most delicious Mexican I ever had.  Very very reasonable.... So not fancy....self serve picnic style....& no margaritas.....but a must stop for lunch, snack or early dinner if you are in Santa Barbara....or passing by on the 101."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"In a previous review, I mentioned that I ate here the  day it opened, and perhaps once a year since, just to see if I was missing something that THE WHOLE WORLD seems to know. I drive past  here about every day, and am always amused by the hilarious, out of town ""foodie tourist"" lines.  The other day, I drove by- nobody at the door, and a parking space out front- why not?   Ordered, ate, and- Darn!  Fresh tortillas, fresh meat, salsa with no heat or flavor.- but, the owner  is still delightful, and I am glad that  Superrica has been hyped to an amazing degree by julia child, and the food television shows to THE WHOLE WORLD, because all this business couldn't happen to a nicer guy, and I wish them all the best!  All I can do is pray that Sunset magazine doesn't find my favorites!   Again, I do feel like a hypocrite, because I don't share my hidden favorites because I am selfish,  But at the same time, I want them to do well and prosper- That is the conundrum of Yelp for me- I have seen local restaurants yelped to death, so locals can't get a seat anymore, but again- good for the owners!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place was a huge let down!!! I'm from L.A. and even the worst taco places in L.A. are better than this!!! I asked for lemon to cover up the horrible taste of the tacos, and all they had were these tiny little slivers that looked like they should be used to garnish a drink or something!!! Not worth the time or money. I should have just gone to the taco truck down the street from my house!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I have officially died and gone to Mexican food heaven.

This last weekend I headed up to the Los Padres National Forest off Santa Barbara for an awesome camping get-away with my best girly friends. No boys allowed! 

We had a lovely time and Hayley, being the smart girl that she is, suggested we hit up La Super-Rica on our way back down the mountain. Man, did I enjoy myself!

We didn't actually have to wait in line for too long, all the while we were teased by the amazing smells coming from inside!

When it was finally our turn I was sooo ready to order! I got the rajas (freaking amazing cheese goodness), and the veggie tamale (smothered in heaven white sauce and filled with so many fresh veggies). 

The owner was the sweetest man! We talked in Spanish for a little while as I ordered and he inquired about my Peruvianess... he also thanked me for coming to his restaurant (Thank me? No, THANK YOU MY FRIEND!)

I don't think I knew Mexican food before La Super-Rica. 
And my friends loved it when I told them what the restaurant's name means: ""Super Yummy!""  No kidding! ... so appropriate!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fun place for ""cheap eats"" and decent tasting food!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love this place! I got the especial del dia which was a creamy mushroom taco, if you are a mushroom lover like me I recomend this, however I'm not sure they serve it all the time; though they should! I also tried the chicken and cheese taco but it looked like a quesadilla, whatever it was it was really good! But not as good as the mushroom taco. And that horchata, best horchata I have ever tried! What I wouldn't do for one of these mushroom tacos right now... Anyway If you are in or near Santa Barbara come here!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"if you want real authentic mexican food definitely try this place, they have lines out the door every day for a reason. They make their own tortillas with a tortilla press and you can tell, they are flaky warm and delicious. Not to mention the meat is phenomenal. I had the quesadilla with chorizo sausage and also shared a variety of tacos. I loved everything I tried. The taste is so unique, I could even taste out a bit of rose water in the salsa verde.... it was to die for! If you want to try something that is not Americanized mexican food, try this place. Any food lovers dream!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I have no idea why there is always a line outside this place!!!  The food is bland, small portions and not really good Mexican food at all!  There are plenty of amazing restaurants serving amazing Mexican food nearby - go to those instead!!!!!  You will be glad you did."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"pos: handmade tortillas, fresh ingredients, cozy atmosphere, family-friendly, and delicious food!

neg: closed Tues & Weds, dishes with no sauce or cheese can be dry, occassional long lines due to popularity, and parking can be hard to find

tip: anything with cheese is delicious; park in the adjacent neighborhood and walk over

rex: The horchata (rice drink) is sweet and delicious, and you MUST TRY: the rajas, tamales con verduras, and the super-rica especial. Enjoy!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We had the Super-Rica special #16, tamales de verdures, and steak taco. The tortillas are all made fresh in front of your eyes, and are a different breed of tortilla than anything you can get commercially. Truly spectacular. The taco wasn't exciting (the meat was good quality, but it was basically just steak and tortilla), but the tamale and pork/chile combo were both unexpected combinations of tastes and ingredients and were beyond delicious.  I'm not sure it would merit over an hour wait, but our 20 minute wait at 2:30pm was definitely worth it. The horchata is also wonderful."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Always come here when I am in Santa Barbara and it never disappoints. Amazing Pozole! If they have it, get it!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"One word: Overrated 

I'm form LA and we have pretty decent and authentic Mexican food. this place just made LA Mexican food look like it was directly from Mexico.

I was really excited and thinking that because there was a long line that the food must be amazing. I ordered a lot of food not expecting it to come out to be $30! So it is pricey as well.

The food was BLAND. My friend tried to convince me that that is how real Mexican food was supposed to taste and that I'm supposed to add salsa for flavor. If I wanted to eat something filled with salsa, I would have just had scoops of Salsa (which are free) instead. I was HIGHLY disappointed and pissed that I spent so much on food that tasted bland (probably made to appeal to more people and their taste buds.)

I had a carne asada taco (which was name something fancier sounding, but when it comes down to it's a carne asada taco) You can't go wrong with something so basic so I enjoyed it the most (It was 2.50 for ONE, it says it comes with 2 rtillas but so do most tacquerias in LA) 

I had Pozole. I was not impressed. I poured a whole thing of chili sauce so that I can taste something. 

I had the veggie tamale. It was sweet tamale which I didn't expect
I had a pork tamale

I ended up dipping the tamales in various sauces to see which one brought out some flavor. No flavors were brought out. the food is just plain bland. 

I had the number 8 which i cant recall. But it was basically Chicken grilled with Bell Peppers and onions plus 3 tortillas. Ummm El Torito makes it WAY better.

I had the Jamaica to drink... SMALL cup, and it was powdered Jamaica not the real brewed ones. 

So, if you want authentic Mexican food come down to LA and go to a King Taco. It's a chain but it's WAY better.

I do give super rica this... They have variety... but who cares about variety when your food all tastes the same?"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Yep, that ridiculously long-line is really for this restaurant.

So, it is the wait worth it?  Probably yes.  It's darn good Mexican food in a somewhat iffy (by Santa Barbarian standards) part of town.  Get the carnitas or any kind of tacos.  And it's reasonably inexpensive.  And it's a dive, just so you know.  The fresh salsa is also really good.

And make sure you check out the cat which sleeps on the top of the car just a half block down from the restaurant.  The owner (of the cat, not the restaurant) told me he has been sleeping there for years."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My family has been coming here for 25 years on vacation. The rajas, tamal verdura, and basically everything is amazing. Best tortillas I've ever had & if you're an East Coast rube like me you'll be psyched you can watch them making the tortillas. However, like all the best spots, it requires some work to enjoy. 

Check the hours: the past few summers we've come to find they're closed not just Wednesdays like it says on their Facebook page and has always been the case, but also Tuesdays. Which you'd only know if you arrived and saw the hand-written sign on the door. I'm not sure why this information couldn't make it to their Facebook. Don't bother calling ahead to check the hours; we did and got a busy signal over and over.

Arrive when they open or be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes. It's cash-only. Get the rajas. The end."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Couldn't believe the line there and wasn't blown away by the food.  It was cool to say we went there, though."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is a gem! Don't let the lonnnng line fool you, it's worth the wait. Very fresh meat, guac, homemade tortillas etc. I will say we got our food super fast so was surprised the line was so slow. They only take cash so do come prepared. Typically when I get street tacos there is onions and cilantro but the #1 came with just meat so what the description says is what you're getting. All in all a great place with friendly service."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place used to be the apple of my eye. Then people from LA started making up the core.


Not that I have anything against THEM, but the place has started to turn into a blander, less spicier place, as if to cater to their newer customer base.

Then with the film fest in town it seems the place was loaded with this rude jerks last time I went. I need a Chorizo every once and awhile, ,but they need to remember who brought them to the dance."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is the place to go if you're only in Santa Barbara for the day. My wife and I have been here at least 5 times and every single time I've came, I left extremely satisfied with the food. No one beats their home made tortillas. No one in town even has some of the amazing tamales they have! Their beer bottles are super cheap too. Nothing negative to say about this place! If you aren't sure what to get, get anything, because everything is great and there is nothing on the menu that would involve an ""acquired taste"". Well worth the wait. Enjoy!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Honestly whoever is saying this place is good has never tasted real Mexican or Latino food before or can't handle real Latino flavor. I was raised in a Latino family and ate Latino food practically every day of my life and this is not Latino food. I also grew up in the Bay Area and tried many of the thousands of Latino restaurants they have - this being said, this is the worst Latino food I've eaten in my life. I'd rather eat Chipotle or Chevies. First of all, not many options. They don't even have enchiladas or flautas (taquitos)! Second, kid sized portions, meaning you have to buy 3+ of everything and making the bill way more expensive than other Mexican restaurants (unless they're more formal). Third, they do not know Mexican flavors or even how to cook/cut the meat. My taco meat, claimed to be carne asada, was definitely not that. It wasn't the right color (too light), texture (too soft), cut (too thin), spices (none), etc. Not to mention it was served to me cold and still pink (I'm honestly assuming it's frozen, processed meat from a grocery store). When I asked them to cook it more, it still did not taste right and they basically served me raw tortillas. The sauces are also very watered down and practically flavorless. I drowned my tacos in the salsa verde and it was hardly spicy. Good service but bad food! Spend your money at a real Mexican restaurant."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Recommended by everyone I asked for food recs in SB. Didn't disappoint. Fresh tortillas you can watch being made while you order. The salsas and sauces are to die for and plebe of vegetarian options!  The agua fresca de Sandia was perfect refreshment after the beach. Would have had multiple meals here!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Whenever we are in Santa Barbara, our days are planned around a few trips to eat here!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"3.5 stars

Personally, I think this place is overrated.  It's good and tasty but I wouldn't say it's outstanding.  Maybe it's because I'm a vegetarian and their menu is lacking in those items.  The people I went with ate meat though and they also didn't think it was anything special.  I really don't enjoy eating inside the little shack either.  Portions are small.  The lines are usually long and extremely slow, so for that reason alone I don't go often. Their horchata is really excellent though."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The Vegetable Tamales are out of this world.  I also like the Sopas.  I recommend ordering from the specials board.  Also, don't be a fatty American and complain that their portions are too small--you're meant to order a couple of things, that's why everything is only a few bucks.  

I recommend eating some pico de gallo while you're waiting for your food--a trip to Super-Rica usually involves a lot of waiting but they are pretty quick considering.  

Super-Rica is also a good place for celeb hunting.  There's nothing better than watching an actress wolf down some tacos!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great tacos! Homemade tortillas and tender meat! Chorizo and Carne Asada are best.  Good prices $2.50 a taco. Called the restaurant at 9:30 (their closing time) and the guy was so nice! He said he'd wait for us, and still served us around 9:45! I'd come back to this spot!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I went to this notorious establishment for my first time and my favorite part was talking to the awesome people who work here and run the place.

Service = 5 stars!!!

horchata = 5 stars!!!
tortillas = 5 stars
#4 pork taco = 4 stars
#1 steak taco = 3 stars
green salsa = 4 stars
red salsa = 4 stars
pico salsa = 4 stars (super fresh!)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"It's cheap, very tasty, and they make everything...their own tortillas, salsas etc.  There are a lot of different influences and years of loyal customers that show in the quality of what would ordinarily be fast food...true ""Cali-Mex"".  Every place in California has that one unique taco place, and in Santa Barbara this is it...there may be more authentic places, but you won't leave Super-Rica hungry or dissatisfied.  Mmmm!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I've been coming here since 1989 when the line was nonexistent!  Sometimes I miss those days, but rest assured, the food is worth every second in line! 
Everyone usually goes for the beef or pork, but the chorizo is the secret gem. And the peppers and cheese are a must."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What great place we stumbled upon. 
No bells or whistles, just good food. 
The Specials, sopas, and cheese relleno were sooo good. The relleno was served in a cream sauce which I wanted on everything. 
The classic #16, super rica was fresh and a great portion. 
We over did it and ordered the chorizo and cheese but were not disappointed.  It had a delightfully smokey flavor.  
So simple, so good. 
The bonus was reading that this was one of Julia Child's old favorites."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Came here because of all the rave reviews and the fact that this is Julia Child's favourite taco ""stand"". 
I definitely had high expectations only to be greatly disappointed. 
We ordered a bunch of things off the menu, tacos, quesadillas, some of the items that come in a bowl with tortillas on the side and horchatas. 

Tacos are just the meat with two tortillas underneath. Assembly is required, this is pretty much the case with most items here. Meat was dry but tasty, the sauces the provide were kind of bland which is very unfortunate as the tacos could have really used something to add juiciness. 

Quesadillas was decent. I think of everything this was my favourite, the cheese used was delicious and they do not hold back on it. 

There were also some items that came in a bowl, I believe it was menu items above 15? 
Totally not what I expected. The pinto bean dish and cheese with tomato sauce were like soups, very difficult to eat. They were ok tasting. Nothing special I would say. 

One common theme across all items is the tortilla. Hand made and cooked to order, I personally had better so was not impressed unfortunately. I like the idea that they are freshly made though.

Horchata was pretty good! It is the first one I've ever had but very tasty. I would say it was a little bit sweet though. But if you are here I would recommend getting it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Cash only! A little inconvenient, but I can understand. I got the cheese quesadilla, chilaquiles, and an agua fresca de sandía. Quesadilla was a little plain and a little too much cheese, but throw some of their pico de gallo on there and it is perfect. That salsa is amazing. Chilaquiles were very good. The highlight of the meal was the agua de sandía. It was hands down the best agua fresca I have EVER had. It was to die for. These guys do it right"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Who gives a donkey shit that some old bag who loved terrines and ugly dresses thought this was the best Mexican food around. 

And honestly the line of food tourists and middle age SB locals outside is quite obscene. Go back to your Costco cookies, frappuccinos and lobster bisque.

Anywho--the handmade tortillas are the kind of foodstuff that people dream about, and each taco creation is spectacularly fresh and unique.  This is unlike any ""tacqueria"" I have ever been to.  

Note--No burritos.  Know what you are going to order before getting to the window inside.  Once inside the menu is directly to the right, and then you only have a minute or so to solidify your choices before ordering.  Don't hold up the line being some hem and haw douche bag."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Bf and I came here on a recent trip to SB.  Everything here is served in relatively small portions.  Depending on how hungry you are, you can probably order 2-4 things per person and not be too terribly stuffed.  Sharing is the best part.

We got:

*Lomito Suizo - delicious.  Like a quesadilla almost in taste and flavor.
*Tacos de Chorizo - really good chorizo.  Solid, would order again
*Tacos de Bistec - not bad. Could be more moist.  Beef was a bit dry.
*Alambre de Pechuga - this was just okay. Chicken was a little dry.  I probably would have enjoyed the tri tip version better.  But still pretty tasty, especially when paired with those amazing tortillas
*Guacamole - amazing guac. Definitely worth the price tag.

The tortillas, as everyone says, is the true star of the show here.  Homemade, soft, amazing.  They elevate every dish they're in.

Wait in the middle of the day on a Sunday was about 15-20 minutes.  Totally worth it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"It is very good BUT:
- I kind of prefer ""traditional"" / basic taquerias and this place doesnt really fit that bill.  Its kind of specialized in more complicated dishes (than just the perfect taco w/ meat, cilantro, onion maybe hot sauce on homemade tortiallas).  So if you understand what I mean, then just choose when to go there accordingly.
- The lines CAN be ridic.  If you go for lunch go at like 11 (I think that's when they open) or like 2 PM.  Its also a lot easier to park around those times.
- I dont really like their pork - whats it called? achiote maybe... I have had it at lots of places in the area and I think the flaovor of theirs is kind of weird, and not good.  Its one of the spices - tastes too much like cocoa or nutmeg or coffee - that I don't like.  
The fact that your tortilla is a pile of masa until you order is awesome (and that you see it happen doesn't hurt). 
Despite all that, its still really good just go there for a break rather than expecting it to be a really good version of the other mexican spots."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"#16 and the #7!

We were just visiting Santa Barbara for 2 days and heard this was the place to go. We went on our first day for lunch, and had to come back the next day again for dinner before we headed back to Los Angeles. Definitely have the horchata, it's not all chalky and nasty like most places. This is the real deal!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Can't beat the price and quality of food here.  Loved loved loved the #7. Alambre de Filete ($5.80) - Tri-tip, Bell Peppers, Onion, and Bacon and the #10 Quesdilla con Chorizo.  If you go to dinner, go late night ... you beat the crowds after 9pm."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is the greatest little divvy place to eat authentic, cheesy and tasty Mexican food.  My family loves this place!  The small, affordable portions will encourage you to order and try several items on the menu.  Plan to wait in a line (we've always had to wait), but the line moves fast and the food is worth the wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We loved this place. Authentic and flavorful. Get the #16, it's awesome! Wish I could have tried the tamales, they looked phenomenal. Don't walk, run...get there before the lunch line is too long (we had a short wait around 11:15)."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is always amazing.  The lines are worth it.   No matter which meats you choose they're always flavorful.   CASH ONLY$$ so come ready.   Today I had their tacos de chorizo and pork chop and their special ""Tamal Vegetal"".  Did not disappoint.   The wait was only about 10 mins to get in and I made friends in line so no biggie. Always enjoy coming here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Simply my fav restaurant in the world.  Not a typical beans, rice, and lard place, so forget your usual preferences, and be experimental.  Order extra tortillas and 2-4 entrees, to mix & match several kinds of tacos."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Not very vegetarian friendly but what they do offer is pretty awesome. Fresh tortillas are worth coming back for. It hit the spot! Definite worth returning.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Just get the rajas. So goooooood. Otherwise, everything else is just okay. The line is long because they're cash only, they don't have a cash register, and they use a calculator for each order. But yes, get the rajas, forget everything else. The other stuff is mediocre. Also, be ready to wait in line. 

I also do like that they have kind of a greenhouse kind of place to sit in. No plants, but's it's an outdoor venue that can be turned to an indoor venue. Also, there is only one bathroom in the back of the restaurant, but it's pretty clean."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I've always heard such great things about this place and always wanted to try it. My husband and I were on our way back home to LA and decided to stop in SB for late lunch. Finding the place was easy and we were lucky enough to find parking easy enough. There was a small line out the door. We were there on Presidents' Day and it wasn't too long of a wait. I've heard that the line could be pretty long. We waited about 10-15 minutes to order. There was a guy in front of us that clearly had been here many times before. He was recommending his favorites to the group in front of him. We decided to try some items he recommended. As a matter of fact, we ordered 6 different items to share. Everything we ordered was amazing. Chicken tacos with cheese, chorizo and cheese tacos, chili rellano, pork and cheese taco, and a couple other amazing items. As we were waiting I was watching the woman hand make the tortillas on the stove. I can't believe all the amazing magic that was going on in that tiny kitchen. So good. I can't wait to go back again. This will definitely be that place we always stop to have lunch when driving north to the central coast."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love this place. Any trip to Santa Barbara includes lunch here. Don't let the setting scare you, best food, amazing price, totally worth the stop!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I went back here this past weekend, the wait to order was 30 min - not bad. Food comes out fairly quick. The owners and workers are very nice. But the food wasn't great this time around, I got a veggie chili relleno and it was tasteless the chicken enchiladas I got were ok. My bf got a # 16 it was good until he found a broken toothpick in it. It ruined his experience, I told the employee and he was very nonchalant about it like: yeah we put them in the peppers to roast them guess we forgot to remove the toothpick from that chili to serve it. 

No that's not ok. If you don't mind the wait and perhaps a surprise toothpick in your mouth come here. I don't think I'll be back. 

Oh cash ONLY!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Once again, an AMAZING place to eat whenever I return to SB! This time I came with Charles L. who had to be exposed to the secrets of great SB eats!

We got #16 Super Rica Especial with those pasilla peppers and very freshly cooked pork, smothered in cheese, on FRESHLY made tortillas! I never paid attention to the fact that they MAKE the tortillas there, and it shows! This is probably one of their best dishes, but everything is fresh and tasty.
Also tried the Chili Relleno, which retained its crunchy fried-ness while being soaked in a tasty red sauce! A surprise is that it wasn't just filled with cheese but also grilled vegetables, creating a tasty dish that adds an air of home-cooked food to this cheap eat!

The food isn't something that will compare to your taco truck or ubiquitously good mexican food throughout California. This food seems to add a very regional twist to classics, and keeping the food VERY fresh and tasty!

Oh and don't miss out on the horchata, its a perfect accompaniment to a fantastic meal! So if your in SB, or EVEN passing through GET OFF ON MILPAS and eat here!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"So many people love this place and it is good. But I don't understand why people go out of their way time after time to go here.

It's good, but not great. Seems like its going off word of mouth, as I didn't notice any local Hispanics coming here for tacos. It was full of tourists passing through, but that's about it.

There wasn't much flavor to the steak taco, it didn't stand on the meat alone and needed lots of sauce. My pork taco was OK, the chilaquiles were decent, and the pork taco, drizzled with cheese,  sandwiched between two fresh corn tortillas was a standout. But nothing worth the 30+ min wait in line!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fantastic guacamole tacos, love that its within walking distance from my house so I can time it just right in order to avoid the long lines. The tortillas are made fresh as you wait and are delicious. Whatever you order you can't go wrong."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"La Super-Rica is must visit while in SB. I just ventured there on my last trip out and was very pleased with the food.The location is well known by locals, and is always busy but is well worth the wait. Everything is made to order there and even the horchada was one of the best I have had. This restaurant is a classic in the area and I highly suggest it to any travelers coming through SB who are in the search of a good Mexican style cafe."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This is probably SB's most famous hole-in-the-wall taquerias. Rumor has it that Julia Child used to eat here, and that's why it's so darn famous. Whenever I'm in town with friends we usually have to stop here because they love it so much.

I think it's okay. I've had better Mexican food, though. For me, the appeal is that it's Mexican food, but with some interesting twists. You never know what's on special, but you end up trying stuff out of sheer curiosity. I've never been disappointed, but then I've never been totally impressed either. 

However, it is one of those local favorites, so I guess you gotta go."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I'm writing this for my boyfriend.  He would give it five stars  He Loves This Place!!  Orders as follows:  #16, 14,19. Sopes (if available), Tacos de bistec.  Usually the same thing.  I'm pretty sure the #19 is the frijoles.  Not your usual refried beans.  This is how we make beans at home.  I don't eat tortillas, so, pretty pointless for me here. (My bf gets all my tortillas.)  But, the #16 is my favorite too.  Also the  roasted chiles pasillas stuffed with cheese.  The chile rellenos are very good too.  The owner has let us try a couple of new dishes to give him feedback.  Good stuff.  Not your usual Mexican food.  If you want the usual go to Del Pueblo or Rose Cafe (yuck) one of those type of places.   Yes the wait is long.  I usually end up talking  to the out of towners, see a lot of the regulars and lots of friends.  One thing I don't like is the table snatchers.  These are the people who send in friends or family to snatch a table way before they are up to order.  That's not cool.  Wait your turn like the rest of us.  Usually works out though."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Different than what you are expecting.... This is not mexican-from-a-restaurant style mexican food. The ""combos"" listed on the menu board do not come with beans and rice (which is why the food is so inexpensive). Don't forget to check out the Daily Specials board - if you don't look for it, you will miss it (my mom never even saw it). Wait in line, order at the counter, try to find a table in the covered porch in the back, and someone will call your number when your food is ready. Everything comes on styrofoam plates and the silverware is plastic. 

Here's what we ordered:
#6 with green chile - it was good, greasy, and cheesy - but, basically, it's roasted green peppers put on a grill, covered with cheese, mixed up, and then put on a corn tortilla
Quesadilla - typical, but made with corn tortillas (so you can imagine, it's tiny)
Rice - smoky (or something), personally, I didn't care for it, but it is something different
#13 ? - the cheese and tomato sauce plate with three corn tortillas - basically this was a bowl with tomato sauce and some melted cheese in the middle - - tortillas come on the side. My mom ate this and said that it was very good, but it honestly looked like cheese soup with tomatoes in it
Vegetable tamale - of everything I tried here, this was good and definitely the best value for the money
This cost $18.
We waited in line for probably at least 20 minutes, maybe more.

I would say that this place is probably GREAT at 1:30am (lol), but it's not worth a 30 or 40 minute wait (from the time you get in line to the time you get your food) during the middle of the day. I would have preferred to go to a regular Mexican restaurant for the time and money spent here. However, if there was a much, much, much shorter line, I would be happy to order something for a small snack, I just don't think the food is good enough to warrant that type of wait."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Santa Barbara staple we have been dying togo to. Super famous, very busy and excellent food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Our family of four got there for dinner on a Friday evening, there was a queue about 12-15 people deep to get in. I had read about this place being one of Julia Child's favorites so had to give this a try. We ordered multiple dishes wanting to try more and the prices almost justify trying multiple dishes. Being a vegetarian I had plenty of options. 

We got the guacamole, Rajas, Veg Tamale, Chile Relleno and the Quesadilla as vegetarian options for the family to share. From the meat dishes hubby got their especial I guess #16 on their menu and beef tacos. The tortillas were being made fresh on the spot. I honestly felt that the food lacked flavor though it did look very authentic. I really wanted to like the food but the white sauce on the tamale and the chile relleno probably killed it for me. The rajas were the best for me. For the meat dishes too, my husband had the same thoughts, he liked the especial more. Do get the horchata though, it was pretty good.

Giving them credit for staying authentic and the fresh food. But taking off a star as it was a little bland."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Stopped here on my way to SD on a Friday afternoon.  I knew I found the place when I saw a line of people standing in the hot sun waiting to order! I ordered #16. The wait was a bit long because they made the food fresh and when ordered. The tortillas were freshly made right next to the grill. 

The food was very good. The meat was very tender and savory. I would definitely stop by again to try other items on the menu."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Being from LA, I was a little skeptical about a taqueria in Santa Barbara. Even my boyfriend was not too convinced after seeing the white-to-hispanic people ratio of the patrons at La Super Rica. I'm also positive that this place is still riding on the hype of the Julia Child mention; I doubt half these people would've been drawn to ever visit this little taco shack without her.

Having said that, everything was pretty decent. I got the #16 that everyone is raving out. It was good-- marinated pork with slices of pasilla chiles covered with monterey jack, sitting atop 3 tortillas. Eat this one fast. Coagulated cheese at room temperature isn't the greatest. I love peppers so I appreciated that the chiles weren't soggy and cooked to submission.

If this place had one really notable thing going for it, it was the fresh pressed tortillas. That really gave their tacos, otherwise just meat atop a tortilla, an edge. If you're fond of onions & cilantros on your tacos, you'll have to ask for some from the kitchen staff; they don't offer it at the salsa bar.

Next time, I want to try the pozole!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Stopped in here after heading back to LA from a bit of road trip.  Got really good reviews and was visited by Adam Richman...and found out thru yelpers that this was a place that Julia Child frequented.  
Cash only, food is pretty reasonable but make sure you have enough bc there are alot of options.
We tried: tacos al pastor, chicken tacos, chile con queso and guac.
Tacos al pastor- a good amount of meat and really good tortillas.  that is it, you need to add the salsa to it if you want more
Chicken tacos- grilled chicken with lots of cheese--pretty good
Chile con queso- grilled peppers/chiles with lots of cheese in tortillas---almost didn't get this one and it was by far my fav
Guacamole- a really big portion that was added to most of the tacos and still had plenty of leftovers to eat with the torillas.
Each order came with two tacos, and for guac it came with two tortillas.
Total dive of a place but pretty quick even with the little line that was outside.  Food was made to order and you saw them cooking it in the open kitchen.
Can't wait to go back once I am in Santa Barbara again.  Check out @onebiteonesip on ig for picture"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"No place makes tortillas like they do here because they have tortilla making down to a science and art because to make them this thin and fluffy it is difficult and must be done very carefully. Everything here is done by hand with no machines which takes tremendous labor. I drive all the way from the valley just to get tacos and drive home and it's worth it. When they have Chilesquiles you can order chips and guacamole but most people don't know that. The orchata is second to none and I haven't had anything remotely close. I believe Julia Child's liked this place because of the extra care put into everything in the philosophy of keeping it simple and using the best and freshest ingredients.

There are three places to park on-premises if you're lucky. The close on Tuesday and Wednesday so don't do what I did a couple times. Probably my favorite thing there is the red and green salsa. The taco de rajas is the best and the rice. There is a bowl of cheese with bacon in it. Need I say more?"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"After a long steep hill hike with Monkey, we were looking forward to grabbing some fish tacos.  Monkey was thinking lets go to this place as we always see a very long line so maybe it must be good but Hell No it was not. 

Monkey don't even know what he ordered but it looks like a steak taco and he got a nice big portion. I ordered the #4 pork taco and two freaking order at $2.50 an order and it looks like a slap on the plates for dogs.  It didn't feel like it was done with love or care. The meat was lightly cooked, I can hear it oink.  

I experience better than this even at Carl's Jr. Mexican selection was better than this. San Diego tacos are better than this and I even ate on the streets of Tijuana and it was not only cheap but tasted better than this.  I don't mind the price but I love food and I love food that taste good.  Maybe for a blind senior citizen, my plate would have been good for them.  

Oh don't forget to take cash as they don't take card so I end up buying lunch with the last bit of cash I got.  And don't forget to tip as you might get looked down on if you don't. 

After this I'm afraid to even try Mexican around town."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"bar none, best joint ever.  don't hesitate to try it.  

la super rica?  they should call it the super delicious."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I'm SO glad we decided to check this place out because the food was every bit as good as we could have expected. We ordered a variety of things and it was all REALLY delicous. I love their handmade tortillas. This place was ALMOST as great as a restaurant in Guanajuato Mexico called Truco 7 which is where I had THE BEST Mexican food  ever! For me this place was an unexpected delight!  We did have to wait in line for 20 minutes, but it was well worth the wait."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It was our first time in SB and this was on the list of places to try
Maybe it was the recommendations, maybe it was the high reviews, or the fact that this was 4 starts!! Way too much hype ...
We waited over an hour just to order and the food was somewhat bland :( Very disappointed"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Nice small place with decent mexican food. The meat was good, a little dry, but had good flavor. On the other hand the fresh tortilla that the taco was on was so delicious. It had a really nice soft texture and true corn flavor, very fresh tasting. If in Santa Barbara, try this place. Good quick food and awesome tortillas!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Why are there so many good reviews here??  We read all the Yelp reviews, most of it glowing, so we had high expectations.  What we got was great service and a horrible meal.  The tortillas were bland and undercooked, and the meat was flavorless.  We had a wide variety - shredded beef, pork, tri-tip, steak - all dry and tasteless.  I think they must have run out of salt that day.  Even the guacamole was nothing more than a mashed avocado with no seasoning.

Stay clear away (unless you are a tourist lured by the many rave reviews from magazines and this website.)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Yes! great chefs great atmosphere etc... love how people are lining up for this and its very authentic, however waiting 1hr in total for pretty average food was frustrating. I cant understand why people wait this long? very bland but I love the atmosphere and the price of the food. If you come at 5pm it will make sure your wait is shorter."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I mean it wasn't *bad* but I didn't understand the line out front. I could step outside and throw a rock in any random direction in LA and find a taqueria at the very least on par with La Super-Rica and most likely better. Heck, I live 3 minutes away from a mini-chain taqueria that offers better salsas and meat varieties than here. I ordered a beef and a pork street taco, and I loved how they literally just had meat on them so I could add what I wanted to after.

Again, not bad but I'd totally try somewhere else next time I'm in the area."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love the negative reviews about this place. It makes me laugh what people say.

It's a taco stand not a 3 Michelin star rated restaurant, you whiners.

Let's get real. This place serves the best F*c*ing tacos and authentic Mexican food in Santa Barbara.

Oh and get the Chile Relleno with Crema if they have it. It's out of this world."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Always has a line, go for an early lunch to avoid too much of a wait.  Whenever I drove by La Super-Rica there was always a line. 

I loved watching the tortillas being handmade in the back while I waited in line to order. The menu is extensive and the salsa is great. Quite possibly the best taco I've had - very authentic. A Santa Barbara must do!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"One of the few foods on this planet that I crave and miss, the tacos at La Super-Rica are not to be missed when you're in Santa Barbara.  Tortillas and salsas are freshly made ever day and their proteins are seasoned and grilled perfectly.  It's a humble little spot away from bustling State Street, but well worth the discovery."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I haven't figured out what all the fuss is about. Everything I've tried here is just bland. I think people get so wrapped up in the hype that they think the quality is good. But it just isn't. The rice was really hard and crunchy. Either undercooked or left in the warmer for too long. The meat was chewy.  This place is on par with Casa Blanca on state street but much more affordable. But that says nothing for the taste or quality of the food. Doesn't break a budget to try out for your self. plus being on milpas, a better tasting Mexican restaurant is only a few feet away in either direction."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Best Mexican food ever and I mean that. It would be a travesty to cruise through Ab and not stop at this landmark experience. Julia child ain't no fool, it was her favorite too, for good reason. Super rica especial is my favorite, the Ticino especial is also out of this world! Melted cheese and bacon! You can't go wrong!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We had to stop by because I found out Julia Child was a fan of Super Rica.

Honestly, I don't see what she saw or tasted in this place. Her choosing Super Rica as her favorite taqueria leads me to believe she had a terrible palate or didn't know what Mexican food should taste like.

I don't want to knock this place because it's got a great little vibe and the place was packed with non-Mexican eaters. Any Mexican restaurant that can get folks to order items that they can't get at Taco Bell deserves credit. I would shake the owner's hands if I knew who he was.

But here's the thing, I grew up on the food that's served here. Pozole, tacos, gorditas, queso con rajas. I expected the food to taste like the food I ate in Zacatecas or Mexicali or Guanajuato. Instead, it was incredibly bland. The poor meats needed lots of salt to coax any flavor out of them. Well, they did have a nice charcoal grilled flavor to them, which was really smokey and authentic. My gordita, while handmade, didn't taste like much when I bit into it. It was spicy, that's for sure, but the texture reminded me of homemade paste. You know, flour and water warmed up on the stove.

I'd come back to try other items again, but only if I've got plenty of extra time to wait on line to do some people watching. Oh, and if I happen to have $15 in my wallet -- this is a cash only establishment."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Came here on a weekday for lunch and the line was out the door. Now I see why! Though pricey for the size of the portion, thier food is amazing! I had the carne asada taco which was one of the best I've ever had. You can tell the quality of all of the ingredients.

In addition, their menu offers uniquely comboed items. I also had the Lomito Suiza, which is a pork taco made in their special way. Yes, the wait is long, both before you order and after, but the service is good and worth the wait. There is plenty of sitting room in a covered outdoor area. Oh ya, and they sell beer here.

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"When a former gf used to live up in SLO, this was a mandatory stop for me on the way up to visit. The gf's mom tipped me off about this shack and used to tell me even Julia Child's herself was a fan of what this kitchen was serving up. 

While everything on the menu is certifiably gold, a solid standout for me is, always and forever, the quesadilla suiza. Holy mother, this thing is thick, good and good for you. Tortillas are top notch, cheese is top notch, and taste is top notch. Are you pickin up what I'm puttin down? Are you!? Don't forget the horchata either, definitely one of my top three places for the rice drink on the face of the planet.

Even back in the day the line coming outta this place was kinda defeating and demoralizing. Whatevs, make some friends, pop out that iphone or just think of your happy place, you'll make it to the front eventually. You would think there would be a roller coaster at the end. Or maybe even a pot of gold. I guess in some ways it is gold, isn't it? Yes, indeed. Despite the overcrowding, seats are plentiful in the back under the tarp and people are generally nice. 

Whenever friends are headed up to the SB area I'm always telling em to stop by and have a taste of what this place serves up daily. Not only is it some of the best i ever had, it's really the only place I know of in SB that i really eat at. I'm sure there are a ton of great places to visit, but it's hard to fix what ain't really broke."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Excellent, authentic Mexican taco stand/restaurant. The menu is somewhat limited yet plenty of tacos to sink your teeth into.  The wait was terrible, the service slow and its pressure at the register. But worth it. Try the queso fundido!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Don't go on the weekend I guess? I don't mind waiting for good food but after 15 minutes and the line moving only inches we ditched this place. If at least the staff were hustling, we might've stayed (and it would've moved faster) but the sloths behind the counter were not worthy of our patronage so we went down the street to Los Agaves and I'm so glad we did. Super service, great, fresh food and staff who hustled!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Hole in the wall but good food. Bring cash and the specials may have been underwhelming. What I mean is the a la cart tacos were better than the specials.  

Would have given 4 stars but there were flies inside."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My friends and I went to a funny-looking little turquoise blue taco shack called La Super Rica Taqueria for dinner. Super Rica was the late Chef Julia Child's favorite Mexican restaurant in Santa Barbara. The Super-Rica Especial is the item to get. Roasted chile peppers stuffed with cheese and marinated pork on top of three fresh corn tortillas. The tortillas are made by hand just before they are placed on the grill. It doesn't get much better than that! I also got a pork tamale, but it wasn't as good as the one I got from a little truck called Grandma's Tamales."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Parking can be difficult, but this is one of the places I like to hit up when I'm in Santa Barbara, for a great burrito and great salsa too. Burritos are big enough to share but that could lead to a very messy situation. Also great for breakfast."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"the food is very authentic, quite fatty and old school. But fun to know you are getting the real thing freshly cooked Eaten in a little tent, it is spotless, and the family who own it have a very good system. No one waits too long, so don't panic when you see the line out the door. Thats normal~!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"There's nowhere like it, says this from-SB mexican food snob exiled to LA (sadly 90 miles from La Super!!).  Alambre de pechuga and the queso with the tocino especial are my go-to's and have been for YONKS now.  It's up there with La Abeja in Highland Park and La Cabinita in Montrose for SUI GENERIS cuisine.  All three are All-Stars in my book/stomach.  Viva.  Nicest, sweetest people work there as well.  Go early, have a cold Corona, for living well is the best revenge, as old Oscar (not de la hoya) said in The Picture of Dorian Gray."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I am NOT about this hype.  I did the waiting in line (45 min) and I would and have waited twice that long for good eats.  I will most definitely say the tortillas are worth some wait but what's in them or what you dunk them in is not.  The chicken breast meat was unmarinated and thrown on a fry grill and salted.  That is what a foodie would call gross.  Ahhh interesting note:  they did not use different tongs to flip raw chicken or other meat.  The pork had a very overwhelming spice (can't put my finger on it) and that was it.  It was not tasty and again not worth a wait.  The biggest disappointment were the beans that come with bacon in them.  How can you not make that taste delicious?  They had flavor, they had bacon in them for Christ-sake!  They weren't flavorful, worth a wait in line beans I'll tell you that.  Again, the tortillas were good.  The salsas were not my taste but the pico de gallo was flavorful."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I ordered the following:

#01.  Tacos de Bistec 
#10.  Quesadilla con Chorizo
#16.  Super-Rica Especial 

Pros:
-  Fluffy handmade tortillas.  
-  Food was very tasty and savory. 
-  #16 is a must get. The combination of cheese, peppers and the seasoning of the meat was tremendous.
-  The salsa / pica de gallo available in the salsa bar blends well with their food since each packed much flavor.

Cons:
*Long line if you don't get there early. Wrapped around the building.
*Closed Wednesdays
*Cash Only 

I think I spent around $16 for this meal since I wanted to taste a variety of things from the menu. It's definitely not cheap but not pricey.  I definitely recommend paying La Super-Rica a visit if you're in Santa Barbara."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Everything from here is gold. I have been impressed with everything I've tried. My go to order is their chorizo tacos and agua de sandia.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Truly a hole in the wall. While waiting for our food in the less than luxurious eating area I found a moderately sized spider on my husband's shoulder. However, the chilaquiles that I ordered were sooo good I have been dreaming of them ever since. The rest of the food was good too. I would definitely go back despite the spiders if the lines weren't so long. All of the hype has ruined a good little mexican food joint."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We read about this place and I  was very excited to try it.  We live in Portland Oregon, travel to Mexico at least once a year and my mother in law is from Mexico and a great cook.  I was very unimpressed with the food.  It was very bland and average.  I don't understand the hype?"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"El nombre lo dice todo. La comida está riquísima y a muy buenos precios. 

The name says it all! It's super delicious and at a good price."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"this place is a must when we visit santa barbara!
the line can be long but it moves quickly....
and the food is sooooooo worth any wait!
love this place! never disappointed!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My first review but came here first time at least 10 years ago. Great food but can take a while to get it. There is a long line to order and wait for food most of the time, but the food is tasty and inexpensive. Their horchata is great and the Mexican cokes are tasty. Love thier guacomole. They cover beef, pork, chicken and veg dishes; most of them revolve around their yummy, super fresh tortillas. There are always specials, and they can be intriguing so check the board. Parking can be a major ordeal; come early or give yourself plenty of time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Too long of a wait both to order and to get the food, but once you have it it's fantastic."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Whenever I'm in Santa Barbara I always make it a point to go here. It's definitely some of the best Mexican food I've had in my life. All of the ingredients are fresh, and you even get to watch as they make the tortillas by hand. 

The portions are nice little tapas, so you're going to order more than one item at a time to fill yourself up. the prices are very good, especially considering the price of most food in Santa Barbara. 

They generally have specials that aren't on the chalk menu, so you may want to check the register window as well. There were generally additional vegetarian options on that menu, so us tree bark eating savages shouldn't have a problem here.

I'd typically order the tamal de veduras, the rajas. Every time the tamale would melt in my mouth, every bit of stress in my life would melt away. I'd generally come here during finals and midterms to treat myself. Plenty of happy memories here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,We just didn't get the positive here. We ate everything here. The food is EXCEPTIONALLY bland and the line to wait is unnecessarily slow. The place is cute but we really couldn't understand how else the reviews could be this positive.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"When you live in Santa Barbara, there's good Mexican grub on almost every block. But you have to wait in line at La Super Rica when friend or family foodies come to town. Sure, Super Cuca's is great, Los Arroyos has top-notch burritos and Lilly's tacos are unmatched, but did Julia Child wax poetic about them? No. So get in line, and spend $25 on a dozen items. Just grab two beers on the front end."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Amazing. We all ordered the #16 (Super-Rica Especial) which is marinated pork on tortillas covered with roasted chilies and gooey melted cheese. Kinda spicy and oh so good! Definitely worth the wait for me. We also ordered sides of guacamole which we piled on top of our entrées.

The line here can be annoying if you have no patience. It's one guy at the counter taking written orders using an old school cash register. It's not exactly efficient but perhaps that's part of the charm? The line was pretty long and it didn't move fast. However, it was easy to find a place to sit in the covered eating area."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It's been 15 years since I've been there so I thought I'd revisit. Not bad if you like your food smothered in cheese. They have a few basic beef/pork tacos on the menu, but to get a chicken taco without cheese, you need to special order it. For those of you watching your fat/cholesterol/sodium/red meat intake, your choices are limited here. Everything tastes good smothered in melted cheese. That seems to be the style at Super Rica. There are plenty of other fantastic taco stands in SB and all over SoCal. Take a chance and try them."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I love this place.  La Super-Rica is a great place to go if you want authentic homemade corn tortillas and yummy mouthwatering guacomole.  I promise you will not find a better place for Horchata except for Spain.  It is not a fancy place but is a great place to go if you are on a budget.  There is usually always a line out the door to order food which speaks of how great the food is.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"20 mins in line on a Saturday during lunch hour. We just got what was popular on yelp and we were happy.  I didn't like the vegetarian tamale or Taco de bistec  everyone was talking about.

If you like cheese, try #14 or the Chorizo Quesadilla."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great food, speedy service, and reasonable prices! A go to place for Mexican food in this area."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"If you don't like La Super Rica, then you don't get it. Nuff said. 

One word: Rajas! Rajas is a mixture of poblano chiles and cheese. You buy several orders and mix it onto everything else you get. HEAVEN on a plate. I have noticed rajas popping up on other restaurant menus. Thank God because it is delicious.

There is no other Mexican food like this available anywhere in California. Trust me, I have looked. I asked the staff and they said the food is from the Southern Region of Mexico. Basically it is small plates of tacos, chili's with veggies and cheeses on handmade tortillas etc. No burritos here. Each plate is under $3 unless you venture to the Alhambres which are bigger portions and still only $6. I agree cash only sucks, but really it is ok to make the extra stop at the atm. It is part of the ritual, as is waiting in line in the sunshine.

I use to live across the street, wow I was lucky. Since then I moved away to San Jose and always stop by when traveling to So Cal. I have waited in long lines in the sun when I had no time to wait at all. Recently I waited only 10 minutes because it was raining. May be the only blessing of year 2 without a Spring.

Also, I like to order to go and take it to the beach to eat."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Amazing little hole in the wall! The super rica special is my fav! The tacos and salsas are also great! My only gripe is the fact that they don't have air conditioning or good ventilation so there are always flies and it's kinda stuffy in the main room. Still worth trying tho if the line isn't insanely long :)
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This is santa barbara's most reviewed restaurant? really?
I have to say I'm not very knowledgeable about different types of mexican cuisine, although i have had my fair share of tacos since i'm fromt LA, and some from SD too. I love my tacos with carne asada, cilantro, lime and hot salsa, i hate taco bell and del taco is whatevers. i had mexican food at least once a week for the past 4 years (that's what living in ghetto south LA does to you, your options are limited! but hey, mexcian food there is good fast and cheap)

this place is interesting. first impression, how is this so randomly popular?
the food was pretty good. i got the carne asada taco, and the special which was a carnitas with zucchini and in a bunch of sauce. the tortilla is also hand made and made to order, definitely fresh!
the carne asada taco was pretty freakin good
but the carnitas taco was a lil too much. kind of filling

$3 for guac. really? REALLY? 
the mexican rice was apparently pretty good, i cannot appreciate mexican rice tho, i love my rice white and chinese =p but my friend said they're good, and they seem to be better than the others i've tried...

however, this place is so over priced, it's unbelieveable! a meal for two came to be $24!! how?! and we didn't order that much! how can a taco be $2.50?!?!

i thought it's supposed to be cheap mexican food. how is this so expensive, especially given the location and decor.

i also paid like $2 for a dinky little shot of horchata. i didn't know people take shots of horchata!?
i've had better horchata for half the price and triple the size. can we say stingy?!

i just feel like this place is a rip off. but i'll give it 3 stars for its unique cuisine.

tip: try their specials i guess? bigger portions

favourites: fresh tortilla, solid food

do not want: steep prices....not worth it

last words: a rip offffff, but at least it's unique, give it a try, but i'm not gonna be a regular customer, with the same kinda money, i can get waiter service by getting a main course from another decent restaurant."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"You'll need to put your traditional (or ill conceived ""californian"") taco and mexican food notions aside.  This is probably the real taco.  The marinated meat is served on hand made (fresh!) corn tortillas.  I HATE corn tortillas... but I loved these.  That should give some testament to how truly delicious these are.

If you're looking for more, you won't find it.  Meat & a tortilla.  That's it.  Get two and prepare to probably want a third but decide against it because the line is too long.  Don't beat yourself up over it though because you don't want to over do it on your first visit.

Finish your Negra Modelo and dish to your friends about your latest accomplishment and enjoy the Santa Barbara weather as the Super Rica tacos sit contently in your tummy as your taste buds savor the memories."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I wish I lived closer. I try to stop whenever I'm in Santa Barbara and it is one of my favorite restaurants.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Great food! We paid 5$ for one meal. They make handmade corn tortillas. If you tip the guy who serves food he could give you a beer.)
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Apparently it's a must when in SB and you ""must"" also order the #16. The main ingredient is a Pasilla chili. If you don't like spicy, don't ask for the dish ""mild"" because as the cashier mentioned, they cannot guarantee it -- just depends on the chili you happen to get. And definitely, don't ask for the #16 sans chili if you're spicy food challenged because then it's no longer the #16. (dude in front of me who asked - I mean duuuh.) That being said, I didnt see what all the hype was about the dish. It wasn't very flavorful to me and dry. 

Instead, order the pork tamal. Best tamal I've ever had. Their masa is the best and it made the tamal super moist. It also had a sauce on top that made it even better. I can't describe it any better other than to just tell you to order it!

I'm a little mixed on their tacos. Generous serving of meat over their famous corn tortillas. I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas but La Rica's are definitely freshly made and you can taste the quality. But despite these two things going for it, their tacos are a bit dry and boring. 

I'd come back here again though, but only for their tamales. Three stars for that, friendly customer service, and a warm and toasty covered dining area in the winter!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"What a disappointment.  The only thing special about this place in my mind is the wait and the cost.  I went at 3:00pm on a Sunday, waited 20 minutes to order and another 20 minutes to get my two tacos.  Although there is a list of different tacos, the choice is actually quite limited, and no customizations allowed.  For example, there's a taco with bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions, but if you can't eat peppers, you're out of luck.  Order something else.  I felt that the cost is about double what it should be.

It would have all been worth it if the food was exceptional.  It isn't.  The tortillas were good, the chicken was fine, but it was in no way better than the tacos I get at a dozen different places in L.A.  Maybe the pork or steak is better, maybe you will have a divine experience if you get the tacos loaded up with peppers or chiles, but what I had was truly mediocre.  When combined with all the other factors, all I can say about Super-Rica is that I have now been there."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place is a little over rated.  I will agree that the tortillas are awesome!  No doubt about it....just like my mom makes em.  And their daily specials are usually very yummy. But I LOVE chorizo and theirs is basically sliced hot dogs...defintaly not yum.
The gordita was alright, but very spicy.  Enchildas were very good as was the spanish rice.  
Not real mexican....but good enough."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Best tamale I've had and my moms are the best for me, but this isn't a traditional Mexican tamale. It's central or South American. I didn't ask. But it was wrapped in banana leafs and it was just the best! Mouth watering. The taco de Rajas was fire as well. Two thumbs up on those two dishes."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This couldn't have been more disappointing. All of the meat was dry and flavorless. There was nothing on the tacos but the meat. The beans were watery and also tasteless. The only good things were the pico de gallo, the tortillas and my canned coke. Anything would be better than this, Julia Child must have been on drugs.

Go to Carlitos on State St instead!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Well, they told us the line was twenty minutes long when it was more like thirty five. Obviously, everybody and their mother knows about this place. We figured there's a reason for it and stood in line while starving. Honestly, it would have taken us the same amount of time to have found another suitable place to eat while our blood sugar was plummeting and, unable to make decisions, we would slowly starve, so we decided to just stay put. Anyway, I digress.

There is nothing remarkable about this place. Nothing. 

A taco is just meat on a couple of tortillas, with nothing else. So I'm not Mexican myself or anything, but I do live in the mission district of SF and eat plenty of tacos on a regular basis, so I was a little surprised considering the fare I'm used to. Regardless, it was food and sustenance so I can't complain about that. 

Their dining room would be an adequate taqueria joint except that it suffers from the affliction of people who haven't ordered yet hovering to ""save"" tables by having one person sit there for twenty minutes (or however long the line is) while people who actually have ordered or are in possession of their food have nowhere to sit."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,The place we always go to when were near SB. The super rica special and tacos are fantastic. The tortillas are made to order. Seating and parking can he tricky but the wait out the door is well worth it.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,A road-side shop for yummy hot and fresh Tortillas. Please don't miss the cinnamon flavoured coffee.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"In love with this little Mexican tacos hole in the wall!!! Cheap, casual lunch spot. The line was around the block, that's how good it is. There's a little woman in the back making corn tortillas so you know this is the real deal. Wish we had a similar place in dc."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Perhaps my favorite restaurant in town, if you are visiting you need to come here. But prepare for s long wait, but it is worth it. I recommend the la super-rica especial and the tacino especial"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I've been here a few times, tried hard to like my tacos, I really did! Go to el bajio or los agaves."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Food was really good, especially #16 special with the grilled meat, charred peppers, and cheese. The homemade tortillas were excellent, but I thought the sauce they have could be better. The #3 taco was bland though. You can definitely find better tacos at other tacquerias. They also had a vegetarian tamales filled with corn, chayote, and topped with some cheese sauce, which was to die for! 

My husband thought this place was pretty good, but not that great (and he's actually from Jalisco, so he knows what good, authentic Mexican food is). I think it's worth trying if you're in the area, but don't drive 2 hours just to see what the hype is about!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We ended up here after discovering that La Super Rica is closed on Wednesdays. To our delight, Los Agaves was wonderful; great good, great staff. An all around win.
Topanga,CA"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Be prepared to wait to place your order, but the wait is well worth it. Fresh little tacos and other small plates make this taqueria very special. From the owner taking your order at the window, to the little lady making fresh tortillas as if by magic, this place exudes charm. Seating is informal in back, and decor is non-existent. But the freshness and flavors make this a must-stop location on any trip to SB."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The best tacos ever, ever. Found out about this place thru a client of mine and when looking up the history Julia Child made it famous when she said she loved this place. Bring cash as thy don't accept CC."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We adored everything about our experience here. Arrived just before 11 and there was already a line forming out the door. They opened on time + the line moved quickly. One of the best roasted peppers I've ever tasted. Amazing tortillas + delish guac. A super generous portion of food. Food was FRESH + service was SPEEDY.

+ beer and Plenty of seating. 
 A MUST VISIT."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My goodness....Julia Child was onto something, RIP Julia.

The signature #17 was delicious and the Corona w/ his little green lime buddy made a perfect companion.  Santa Barbara is one of the coolest placest I know, eating at at La Super Rica will only add to it.  Great food, great value, friendly staff.

If you're taking a trip to SB, make sure you put this puppy on the agenda."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The food is good, but to wait in that line is simply not necessary.  There are several mexican joints in town that equal this place.  Still, I love the little shack atmosphere"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Any chance you guys can open up a secret NY joint?

I hadn't been back here in years and being away from CA for so long, I had almost forgot how great solid Mexican food is.  I was only here on my last trip, one day, but because my rental car broke down while at lunch, I stayed and ate a 2nd plate.  

The Adobado and Chorizo were the stars here. I was disappointed by the Bistec.  Get the tamales here as well, unfortunately there were sold out when I was last there.   I'll be back when I'm in town again."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"WAY, way over rated. Somehow this hole in the wall place is till thriving off LA weekenders from Julia Child's endorsement a zillion years ago. Very small portions and not very good."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Nice homemade tacos but all of the meat lacked flavor. For a place with such a long line and wait for food (not sure why it takes that long for tacos to be made, to be honest -- over 15 mins), this place isn't worth it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Save your money, food is bland at best, the wait is horrible and over priced. Go to Lilly's tacos it's just down the road."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is interesting.  My first time eating here was so-so but the second time was perfect.  The pork tacos (al pastor) were sooo juicy and made perfect by avocados I brought myself.  I love how the corn tortillas are handmade, fresh in front of you and I love the crowd that gathers there.

Now I can't wait to go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The food is actually very good, but they give u small portions of it and it's pricey for those small portions. o_o It's always crowded here though- srsly there's almost always a line out the door. 

The atmosphere? Sucks. Sucks bad. They're too cheap to spend the tons of money they make to renovate the place (not that I blame them for that) But srsly it's all plastic chairs and utensils. I never liked the inside. Everyone puts up with it cuz the food's good tho."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Coming from a born and raised Mexican, these are good tacos! There is a reason why it has been around for 32 years. Good stuff."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Get the chorizo taco and #16. They were awesome, but both chicken and steak tacos were pretty bland."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Wow, let me start off by saying how surprised I am that most of these reviews are from tourists who visited SB once for a weekend. Granted, it says that I live in Seattle, but I lived in Santa Barbara 6 times longer than I've lived in Seattle. 

So let me give you all some context and a history lesson, and hopefully it should clear some things up. First, Mexico is a big country. So ""Mexican"" food does not just mean burritos, rice, and beans. De acuerdo? This food is the most authentic Mexican food you are going to get. Second, tourists hang out on State Street. What do you find on State Street? Bad restaurants, tourists, and stores that sell tourist shit. If you want to see the real Santa Barbara, cruise down Milpas. If you want to eat where the locals eat, go to La Superrica. Or if you want your rice and beans and your big Sunday brunch, then stay on State St and go to El Paseo. 

Why is there a line out the door? 1) Because the window to order is right inside the door. It's a small place. So you stand on the street. But it's not like it's cold, or hot, or rainy, or windy. So enjoy the sunshine and get your vitamin D while you wait. 2) There is also a line out the door because it's freaking good food. 

Why does the line move so slowly? They make the food when you order it. I know, novel idea, huh?

Now for the history lesson- the owner of La Superrica was originally a grad student at UCSB. At some point he decided grad school was not for him and so he went back to Mexico, learned how to cook, then came back up to Santa Barbara and opened La Superrica. And I would say he's a lot more successful than other students who ended up getting PhDs. Because no one's writing about them on Yelp.

Viva La Superrica!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Definitely worth a wait in this line. We eat here pretty often when we come to Santa Barbara. Their food is very authentic and always made fresh.  Raja's con queso,  Yummy! Their fresh tortillas are hand made. Never been disappointed here!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I love his place. The best tacos made from scratch ever. I love how they make the tortillas as it goes. Fresh and delicious tacos.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I was passing by, and I found on Google maps this Tradicional Home made Mexican food, I had  the ""chicken alambre"" and I loved the taste and the price (5.80) ... Everything is cheap and tasty"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Went here on a recommendation of a friend and waited over an hour. Once it was our turn to order, a friendly and efficient man took our order and I got a peek into the tiny kitchen with three cooks with fast, the pace was relentless with long line still forming at 2:00 PM. We orders several tacos, vegetables tamale, number 16, and a hibiscus agua fresca which was refreshing, but tad too sweet for my taste. The handmade tortillas were good, the meats, Ok, everything was just ok, almost bland. The affordable price is what saved this place for me, but really, it was not worth the hour plus of out time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I admit, I know when not to go in order to avoid the lines - but on occasion when I need rajas I'll wait...  Don't go for the atmosphere, don't go if you can't stand the wait, GO for the rajas (pasilla chiles).  The food is great and the price is right.  Don't expect a burrito - there aren't any on the menu.  Get the Especial or the rajas or the queso con chiles or the tacos al pastor and DEFINITELY get an order of the guacamole (delicious).

Worth the wait.
Oh, and it is cash only."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Best homemade tacos north of the border! Worth the long lines; authentic Mexican food experience with a fraction of the prices!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is the real deal 
Authentic solid Mexican foods with old school ambience... 
mmmmm. 
Every time I'm SB we'll go here !"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Julia Child was right.

I really had never had anything like the food this taqueria served when I went here in 1985, and in the 24 years since, have never seen food like it again.

I suppose the Frijol Super Rica (bean soup with tortillas) is an essential order, and my personal favorite is the Pasilla Chile and Cheese with Tortillas. It is a spicy, smokey, gooey mess.

I would recommend this place above all other places to eat that I have ever been in my life."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Sorry to rain on the parade, but I just don't get the hoopla about Superica.  Sure, it's quaint, but there is better Mexican food in SB."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"boyfriend is local for 38 years. Yes, it's been open that long! Have the number 8 if you like chicken, and don't forget to order a few tortillas on the side, and say hello to the amazing Isodore. Insider tip: Go right when they open at 11:00, and if you go on weekend, prepare to wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This has been called, in print, by a true expert in food and the highest profile food critique in the world, in her time.  The best restaurant in California, I unreservedly agree.  Just try the Rajas (#7) and Super Rica Special made with chicken (#16 modified).  You'll be forced to agree with that sentiment, you'll be in good company! 
JULIA CHILD - knew food - she's the critic that called this the best restaurant in California!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"At long last we have returned to Santa Barbara to dine at our favorite Mexican restaurant of all time, La Superica. Yesterday we left Santa Cruz, just under a 5 hour drive, planning to drive straight there for a long awaited lunch. Much to our dismay  they are closed on Wednesdays, so we had to wait until today. Be careful about dining here for you will be forever changed by the experience. Their tortillas 
are made on the spot and are for us a nearly religious experience. The thin orange salsa which my husband describes as ""thermo-nuclear"" is tasty but should be used sparingly by most 
mere mortals. The green salsa is amazing as it changes flavors as you enjoy it, starting out pleasantly spicy, then with a sweet and fruity flavor, and finishing up with a savory vegetable tanginess which is out of this world. The pico de gallo is perfectly balanced and always amazingly fresh.  My go to dishes are number 7 Alhambra de fillet, number 12, pechuga Suisse, and number 19 the homemade frijoles. My party all agree to pass dishes around so that we can taste as many flavors as possible. I've eating here for over twenty years and I hope to do so for many years to come."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Nice local taco stand, but doesn't stand out from the many excellent Mexican taquerias in SoCal. Overhyped with lines out the door. We came early and did not wait long but I can't imagine wasting ones time in an hour long line for just ok cheap food. The meats were on the dry side. I liked the house made tortillas. My favorite dish had grilled and blackened chili rellenos over chicken and cheese. The horchata was very sweet with some cinnamon in it..

Not really worth a special trip unless you want to see what Julia Child's favorite taqueria is like."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Order the #16 chili's filled with cheese and marinated pork. Get a side of guacamole for each person in your group. Wash it all down with a glass of horchata. Delicious! Be warned, there are no chips! But the homemade tortillas are Devine. Fresh! Had a 20 minute wait at lunchtime. Very satisfying all round. Now we can check it off our bucket list."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We ordered a #1,9,14 and 18.  The chorizo was absolutely amazing!  I'll definitely return during my next visit to Santa Barbara."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We come to Santa Barbara once a year (from San Diego) to dine at some of the nicest restaurants but what we really look forward to is our lunches at La Super Rica. Vegetarians, try the Rajas. They're incredible."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great food! Fresh tortillas,pork was super moist."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Hype or no hype, the #16 pork stuffed chili pepper was outstanding. 
 
The carne asada tacos were very, very tasty as well-- good, high quality meat, perfectly seasoned.

At noon on a Friday, the wait in line was about 15 minutes, and the wait for the food was under 10 minutes -- time well spent for delicious food.  If the idea of waiting in line bothers you think of all the time you've likely spent waiting to pay your tab at a restaurant -- often at least 15 minutes.  At La Super Rica you are spared waiting to pay your tab.  You pay the waiting piper on the front end, which to me is preferable."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love this spot! Remember to bring CASH as thet's all they take! They have great food order a variety! I love the horchata and now that were regulars we get a horchata to wait with and one for our meal... Such a treat! And I love watching them make it all from scratch in front of you Tortilla's and all! 

Talk about a place that appreciate's their customer- be ready to wait in a line because it's that good!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"FINALLY got around to trying this gem of a hole-in-the-wall!  After living in Santa Barbara for three years, we thought it was about time to try the coveted ""Julia Child's favorite Mexican restaurant.""  We went for the #2 (steak tacos), #16 (the special with marinated pork, cheese, and grilled peppers), and #18? (guacamole and two tortillas).  We loaded up on the fresh salsas and eagerly awaited our order.  There was plenty of seating (specifically, lawn furniture) in the semi-covered patio.  We were there at around 4:00, so it wasn't too busy.

When we got our food, we couldn't wait to dig in.  The #16 is definitely not overrated.  SO tasty.  LOVED the peppers.  Would definitely order it again.  The homemade tortillas and the guacamole were certainly tasty.  I loved that we could literally watch our tortillas being made from scratch as we waited in line.  The steak was pretty good in the steak tacos, but we'd probably try something different next time.  The salsas made everything taste better.  And we got a generous-sized cup of water, which is a lot better than those mini cups that most places give you, to make you feel bad for not buying a beverage.

The whole meal for me and my boyfriend was $13 - quite the deal!   And the cashier was friendly, and they bussed the tables in a timely manner.  This place is definitely worth trying."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"too much hype, long wait for short line today. I would not come back and just go to Lilly's tacos next time. 

tip: first timer and having food to go? keep in mind you only get meat and tortillas. nothing else. make sure you get tons and tons of salsa. we ended up eating dry tacos. they will not tell you it has nothing but flavorless tortillas and meat."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Tortillas were great because they're freshly made. Food was good but a little greasy. Overall good but a little overrated. They shouldn't allow checks as payment it slows down the one register line.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Good but VERY overrated. Atmosphere is great. Food is pretty good but there are much better places nearby. That long line on Sunday is mostly dipspits from Los Angeles thinking that they know about a local secret. Locals mostly eat elsewhere.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The Hongas (mushroom) Tacos were out of this world and well worth the long wait on the line. It had big quarters of mushrooms in a tangy sauce.  Not spicy. Flour tortillas were made on site and were very, very good.

I also had the Chile Relleno stuffed with cheese and vegetables. It had a light, cooked- to perfection- breading / outer layer.  Sauce was outstanding.  On this entrée, buyer beware if you are ""heat averse."" I didn't read the description carefully to see that one of the vegetables was a medium to hot pepper so it was spicier than expected, but it was good.

The coffee with cinnamon was highly presweetened  and the coffee was not a strong brew .I am not sure if this is how the drink is supposed to be but for me,  the coffee was not drinkable due to excessive sweetness.

The watermelon cold drink was terrific.

We will definitely return."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Quite authentic. Fresh and tasty. They even roll the tortilla dough in real-time.

The lines were very long, but we hung around only because of its Julia Child reputation. 

They could reduce the waiting outside a lot by introducing a token system, methinks."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Umm hello...three words to describe La Super Rica Taqueria is fresh fresh fresh. 

Freshly made tortillas + fresh guacamole + fresh pico de gallo are a deadly combination.  And to top it off I loved that I didn't feel awful after eating this - fresh is the way to go! 

I just tried this joint on Sunday and my recommendation is: 

1) stay to eat it fresh (but bring a magazine or a hat as you may be waiting awhile in line to get in). 
2) Added the hella fresh guacamole and equally fresh pico de gallo to the rather simple tacos (it's seriously just the freshmade tortillas and meat unless you get some other specialty). 
3) And for godssakes, get the pozole if they've got it up on the specials board. 

The tacos are rather plain on their own but with the sauces they were pretty tasty.  I ordered a trip tip taco along with their #16 Super Rica Especial - chopped up pepper with pork on top of tortillas and smothered with cheese and I swear I will always order that one when I go.  So good after a  night of partying. 

But be warned, don't show up with a hangover, it'll be agony waiting in line, and bring cash!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We had read about this place and the rave reviews so decided to try it. Even on a rainy day there was a line down the sidewalk. We were not disappointed. The #16 was awesome, as was my #7. Bring cash."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Excellent tamal. Fresh tortillas are pretty good. Horchata is pretty good. Food is fast, fresh and cheap."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We were across town at Hendry's Beach at 5 PM, with tickets for an event downtown at 7. DH made a half-hearted effort to talk me into going to some other Mexican restaurant more convenient, quicker, blah blah. I said NO. Although we waited about a half-hour to order and a half-hour for food (beginning at 5:30 on Friday evening), he turned to me at the end of the delicious meal and said, ""Next time we're arguing over where to go for Mexican in SB, just remind me of this."" IT'S ALWAYS WORTH IT."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Small place with big taste. Everything is delicious. Best tortillas ever ! 
#entertainment720approved"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,My friends and I made a quick stop here on our way to Pismo Beach. The tacos and salsa were pretty good.  The line is long and there was a weird strong chemical smell while waiting in line.  The parking lot is small so we parked down the street.  The seating area to dine in is also small but a spot cleared up for us within a few minutes.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"~

Hella sentimental value with this place...

Sometimes the salsa is so fresh that you can actually take a few bite's as an appetizer.  

Memories !

6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Stopped here after reading the Yelp reviews. They were spot on!  Had the #11 and #16 and both were a great twist on authentic Mexican food.  Four stars only because it takes a while to get your food.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I wasn't sold on this place. Nothing special about the food, there are other taco places in town that have much, much better tacos than they do here. And the line is ridiculous, not only is it only one cashier but that one person does a multitude of other things too. I love Mexican food and know what good, authentic Mexican food tastes like and I was not one bit impressed."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"For a place that thrives off Julia Child stellar reviews, this place is mediocre at best. How do you serve dry tacos without cilantro or onion?! Or with watered down salsa? The inefficiency of this place is ridiculous. Go to Lily's if you want authentic tacos and better customer service and won't have to wait an hour for your food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Great taco shack style restaurant.  Pork Tamale and the queso with chorizo (especial) with corn tortillas on the side were amazing!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place was hyped up, so I decided to try it.  Mistake.  Small portions and not very flavorful.  The tacos were very dry.  Rose cafe kicks this place's butt"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We had read the reviews but wanted to experience this place ourselves.  We were not disappointed at all.  The corn tortillas ARE the best, and we have been to alot of Mexican restaurants.  The guacamole was fresh and delicious; the chile relienos were our favorite.  We anticipated a long wait but were in line only about 30 minutes.  My son enjoyed watching the lady make the fresh tortillas while we waited.  I only wish this restaurant were closer to our home!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Homemade tortillas are riduculous here. I want a blanket made of one for Christmas!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Not sure why this gets such good reviews. This was our second time coming here (span of 5 years in between) with essentially the same feeling: overrated.  We went for lunch, and of course had to wait in 100 degree heat for over 30 minutes to order.  Why can't they put up an awning or something to block the sun?  The order itself takes FOREVER to come.  The chicken was tender with some grilled onions and green peppers, which were good, but the chicken was not seasoned and required a lot of salsa.  The tortillas were totally soggy and falling apart.  It was pretty difficult to eat."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Holy authentic Mexican food! This place is amazing and the food is more authentic than the food I had in Mexico. A local took me here and let me know it is a Santa Barbara staple- I quickly learned why. You can watch them cooking through glass windows, where you find a woman hand-making tortillas on a press- unreal! I don't eat meat but even the vegetarian options here are so flavorful meat eaters wouldn't know the difference (though they of course have plenty of meat options as well). I'm obsessed with tamales- they were perfectly spiced with a little kick, cream sauce was delicious and flavorful and everything cooked perfectly. By my friends suggestion I had the Rajas which also blew my mind- full of flavor and delicious. They have complementary fresh salsa with chopped tomato, cilantro, jalepeno and whatever else is in there which I could have eaten as a side all on it's own. La Super-Rica is an experience and not to be missed if you're visiting or a local.

The food is fresh, delicious and inexpensive. Best Mexican food I've had thus far in SoCal!

Favorites:
Rajas

*This place is cash only!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is awesome! We got here at 11am and huddled underneath the awnings to avoid being pelted by the rain.  I highly reccomend the spiced coffee, and the mushroom taco that is on the special menu.  The mushroom taco will convert those who have never appreciate good fungus. 

Make sure you bring cash and an appetite.  This is a must visit!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,We LOVED it!! No thrills but tasty food for a great price. Salsa was great and loved the enchilada special.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We have been coming here for many years and always wait in line, happily. We waited about 30 minutes for what we expected to be super good tacos, as the name suggests. The tacos de rajas were superior. The Bistec and Adobado tacos were lackluster in appearance and very ordinary tasting. The tortillas are all handmade so that made them better. The queso fundido con chorizo was actually made with some sort of longaniza sausage and by the time we got it the cheese was already hardened. I would not order that again. Next time we'll order the rajas, chile relleno, and corn with zucchini and tamales. Not sure I'll wait next time. And make sure you have cash. No cards accepted."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Deliciuos, authentic Mexican food. If you want a real Mexican meal, eat here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,So sad. I was so looking forward to eating here..surprised when total was $ 34.. Wow did I order that much? Come to find out two of three thing I ordered were on the 'specials' menu with no price. I know why now. $7.75 for chiliquillas & $8.45 for Chile rellano...emmm.no no it worth it. I could have had tri tip for way less. Stick to the tacos..
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Forget about the line.  It is worth it.  Tamale is to die for.  I was in Santa Barbara for 3 months and waited until the last night to go.  Boy was that a dumb decision.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,After having read the reviews on this site and others I was excited to have a free morning to try Super Rica.  I arrived there just after 11:00 in the morning and found no line.  Awesome off to a great start.  I ordered a bistec taco and one of the daily specials(a tamal).  Food was ready in about 15 minutes.  Not bad considering everything is made fresh in front of you.  Once I recieved my food and a sampling of the salsas I dug in only to be really disappointed.  The food had absolutely no flavor.  The bistec was not seasoned at all (I guess they rely  on you using the salsas) and the tamale had the same problem even though it was full of fresh veggies. I might go back one more time to see if I went on a off day But if there is a line it would not be worth the wait if I experience the same bland food (really no taste at all).
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Visit: 6/5/16 Sunday 1:30pm. Line was pretty long, wrapped around to side of building. First time visiting Santa Barbara and had to see what the hype was about. 

Know this: CASH ONLY!

They are slinging the corn tortillas fresh. (always a plus) 
I tried the rajas con queso, special chicken chile relleno and a spicy bean gordita. The man taking the order reinforced: it is VERY spicy. And it was indeed! whew - so good.

The chicken chile relleno was especially flavorful! The rajas were grilled to perfection and smothered in cheese. The Spicy Bean Gordita was especially spicy (as warned) and chased the heat with a Modelo - all is good with the world.

Getting to order takes a long time. One man taking the order, then serving the drinks, etc.. but once you order and are seated, the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.

Fresh, good - and if you ask me: worth the wait. I'd def hit this spot again!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Believe the hype! We got here on a Saturday evening, and the line was around the corner, but we decided to still give it a try, and we do not regret it at all. I had the Lomito Suizo, my wife had the tacos de bifstek, and my kids had the cheese quesedillas. All was great!!! The corn tortillas that were made fresh, and you could even see them flatten the tortilla then put it on the grill! Doesn't get much fresher than that! We also had the horchata and agua de coco, which were fantastic! I would even border to say dang near perfect! I wish I ordered some drinks to go! Seating was spacious and service was great! You can wait for seats to free up but once you get one it not too bad. The bathroom was decent, I even say it was better than my hotel bathroom back in Thousand Oaks. :) The price was good too! I wouldn't say dirt cheap, but very reasonable.
We will definitely  be back here when we are in town."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,THE BESTEST HOLE IN THE WALL EVER!!!! YUMMMY YUMMMY YUMMMY get in line before the line gets you-- don't forget closed on WEDNESDAYS!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I love the handmade corn tortillas, but still think that the meats could be better. Esp. #1, which was just chopped steak - fine enough but not well seasoned and nothing else in it! Also had the number 8, grilled chicken with some veg -- filling, but still not amazing. Good enough - 3 stars."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Wonderful!!  The waiting in line is so worth it.  Love the staff too and those tortilla makers are amazing...
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Some of the best Mexican food I've had. I'm really glad I had a chance to stop by Viva Taqueria while I was in Santa Barbara. Got a full array of tacos to help myself out with. Everything in here smells delicious, and you can watch them make their own tacos from scratch! Pretty exciting. 

Definitely also recommend grabbing an horchata drink if you're thirsty. (Never had horchata? Perfect time to try it. It's a rice milk drink. Sweet, refreshing and delicious.)

There's plenty of seating inside, but I had my meal to go."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Crusin' thru So-cal last year, we rolled up on this taco joint.
With a hunger in our bellies, and wanting to try all Santa Barbara had to offer, the line out the door beckoned to us.
This was one of the best taco stands I've eaten at.  The menu was unique, the food was delicious and the open air, covered permanent-temporary seating in the back made the Tecate taste exactly as it should in the warm pacific air.
The green chili at Ralibierto's in Westminster Co reminded me of that trip and of this place.
Word."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Super fresh. .super tasty...eso si es la super rica!  Infamous for being one of Julia Child's favorite go to spots in santa barbara this place is real deal taqueria with traditional and not so standard taqueria fare. Everything including the tortillas is homemade. Try the grilled poblano with cheese and griddled pork, adobado or bistec tacos. Specials included tamal norteno with pork or vegetarian tamal..enchiladas with chicken and potatoes in a tomato crema were excellent.  Great fresh salsa bar too."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,The food here overall is good however the vegetarian dishes are way better than the meat ones (Meat tends to be dry). The chile rellano and the taco with sauteed mushrooms are both absolutely amazing. The tortillas are phenomenal as well
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The line at this place is definitely long. We got there around 2pm on a Saturday and it took about 45 minute to order and get our food. There was three of us and we ordered the special, the taco with tri tip in it, the guacamole and queso. We basically ordered everything the person behind us in line told us to since she was a regular. It was all delicious. The only caution I have is that I would not consider this authentic Mexican food. It's definitely good but not authentic."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love the food here! It's so simple, but high quality and delicious. The tortillas are made to order and so fresh. My only complaint is that the lines are often long and they never seem to be open when you want them to be. They're inexplicably closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I've been here a couple of times and I have always had mixed reviews about their food. What stands out from this place is the fact that they make fresh tortillas and that is what usually steals the spotlight in every plate. The menu has simple ingredients, they mostly consist of some type of meat, chessee and girlled peppers. I've had the Enchilada special, alambre de pollo and some type of quesadillas. They all have been good but not outstanding. In my view the meat/poultry is in need of a little more seasoning. I've had plenty of delicious Mexican food (mom's and grandma's kitchen) but for 'eating out' I guess this place is the best around. The prices are reasonable and the ingredients are always fresh. Bring cash because they do not take cards :(. I plan to come back and try other dishes."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Classic Mexican cuisine, just delicious homestyle wonderful food. Very affordable too! You could feed the whole family for less and it would for one person at some of the fancy-schmancy restaurants!
Bring the family!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Every time I visit my sister in Santa Barbara this is the one place I have to go visit!!!  And when I'm driving down south to San Diego, I take 101, just so I can pass by this place!

 It's Mexican food like no other I've ever tasted.  Theres a reason for the continuously long line.  I love the Super-Rica Especial, the pork is well seasoned and has just a little kick to it along with the Pasilla peppers.  Top it off with their Pico de Gallo and it's AMAZING!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Sorry to be the odd one out here but frankly I have had better on several occasions at several different places. 

I have been there 4 times as I really wanted to see what made people such fans; but I have yet to experience the ""greatness"" of this place. 

Maybe I am just missing the point here, or just hitting them on their ""off"" days but after 4 tries I give up!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"A blustery Santa Barbara day made us decide on La Super-Rica. We have been here a few times before and haven't had the most excellent experience...but we always want to give this 'raved-about' taco spot, one more chance. I feel like I always order the same thing, Pechugas Suiza (chicken quesadilla/taco with cheese), mainly because of the fact that I don't eat red meat and that is prevalent on their menu. I also ordered the Rajas taco. Food comes after a bit and I can't see how it took so long, given the messiness of the items (I'm not picky about that by the way...just saying). The flavor is good! There was even a bit of that delicious burnt cheese on the Suiza. I began to feel way too 'over cheesed' though. In fact, I'm still too cheesy. Ugh. Reaching for a handful of ginger chews to fix it now..."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I am going this weekend to eat & take photos!!!! Yeah
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Finally a legit taco joint that makes some seriously bomb mexican food.
 I am so over the traditional mexican restaurant that serves the same bland red rice with a ladle full of canned refried beans and cheese and a chefs tostada. Don't get me wrong its good but its not really authentic. My Dutch in laws could make the same meal that most mexican restaurants put out. These joints are easy to find and are everywhere.

La Super-Rica is not one of these joints.  Its actually pretty hard to find come to think of it. You can easily drive by it and miss it if it wasn't for the long line crowding the sidewalk that flags you down.  I spoke with the owner of the place while he was taking my order. You know a mexican food place is going to be good when you see an old mexican man who is the owner actually taking your order and over seeing the whole kitchen. He told me how he moved here from Jalisco Mexico and started this restaurant using all his mothers recipes as well as using some of the local flavors to mix it up a little.

Enough small talk, lets talk food.......I always hate when vegans review restaurants like this place and give it 3 stars but never order anything with meat on it. Your reviews are ridiculous. Uuuugghh this bugs me. Anyways we ordered about 6 different dishes and all of them were amazing in their own way. Take the #7 for example. Grilled Tri-Tip sliced with sautéed onions and bell peppers all mixed together with crispy pieces of bacon!!!!! Are you kidding me???? So good. This entree came with three tortillas. By the way all of their tortillas are fresh and made to order right in front of you. Another delicious treat was the #16 which was by far our favorite. Seasoned pork shredded and mixed together with grilled chili relleno peppers covered with cheese and placed on top of two tortillas. Along with these we ordered a side of guac, pork tacos and an unforgettable tamale stuffed with veggies and covered with melted queso. I can't say enough about this place. I truly believe they serve the best mexican food in the whole state of CA and I put there tacos second to none in flavor and authenticity. 
Cant wait to go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Best mexican in the world. I eat here often and miss it when I'm gone.

Snarky, self-proclaimed food snobs love to hate popular restaurants. Let them hate, this place is world famous for a reason."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews before I found myself in the neighborhood and in need of food. And fortunately I showed up at 2:30 and the line was only a few people.
I saw a positive review for the #6 rajas, so decided to give that a try along with the #1 bistec. I'm so glad I ordered that #6. I'll come back for that. I wasn't as impressed with the #1 but it was still good. The salsa verde was my favorite.
The only disappointing part of the experience was having to contend with the flies in the dining area. It's understandable because it's a covered patio with openings where flies can make their way in. Perhaps next time I'll get it to go and find a local park."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Every chance I get I go to La Super-rica. The food is just wonderful, simply cooked and plentiful."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Wow. I must say, after eating at La Super-Rica, I'm not sure it's possible to make the SF-LA trek *without* making a quick stop in Santa Barbara! 

Thanks Yelp Mobile for helping us find this one!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Always have LOVED Super Rica since the 80's. Thursday, dashed in last minute with no line out the door. Ordered my two favorites - #6 Chiles and cheese with tortillas and Special Tamal. They both tasted very different from what I had remembered. I was thinking it was just me, and then realized, the off taste was the orange cheddar cheese. Orange cheddar cheese in my Super Rica was just not tasting right! And the thick, homemade tortillas, were not cooked through which was the least of the issue but worth paying attention to. Bring back the Mexican queso!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Went here to see what all the buzz was about
Yes there was a huge line
Once i ordered (just had a quesdilla)
Did not enjoy waiting 25 minutes for a tortilla and cheese
Was it good you ask
YES it was
worth waiting a total of 40 minutes to order and get my my food
NO!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"4 years ago we had stopped at this tiny taqueria in passing, and I remembered the Chile Rellano being unbelievable good.  (I've tried to recreate it at home a few times since). A grilled Pasilla pepper stuffed with cheese swimming in an Alfredo-like sauce with a garnish of parsley, to make you forget it came on a plastic plate.

It appears this place has gotten some publicity since then, as I was surprised to find the line around the corner at 2pm on a Sunday.  

I thought the tacos were fairly priced at $2.50, until I saw them.  A little bit of meat on 2 tiny palm sized tortillas.  They were fresh, I saw them being made in the sweat factory by the grill when we ordered at the window.  It was really hot and there was no A/C.  The shredded beef taco special of 2 tiny tacos rolled with avocado cream on the side, was way over priced.  Salsa bar was scarce and neither salsas were more than ok.  The chile Rellano con creme was good but not as I remembered.

Besides the fact that I was very hungry by the time we got the food, would still say it was fairly average for Mexican food in this area."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Either it has gone down hill, or my taste has gone finer (I've been there since the 90s and have recently gone back). I love that they freshly make their tortilla. However, I got to taste their tacos without the pico de gallo (tomato recall) and I was pretty disappointed. The wait is still long as usual, the staff is still the same, but my craving for them is gone (that's a good thing since I moved away again).

O and they're closed on Wednesday..the day I have time to go."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"La Super- Rica is highly reviewed and I was excited to try it. I must be honest, I am not as obsessed with it as others are. I appreciate the fresh homemade tortillas but I think they could be cooked a little more and made thicker. The meat juice and salsa make the homemade tortilla soggy quickly. You must eat fast! Their steak tacos are standard, nothing mouth watering but not disappointing either. The dishes with the melted cheese help to add flavor to their dishes. For example, I'd recommend getting their Lomito Suzio rather than a pork taco. 

Their vegetable tamale is delicious. It is steamed perfectly. I enjoyed the cream sauce too. If you like a lot of flavor and salty, I wouldn't recommend the cream sauce. If you want a lighter taste, I think you will enjoy it. 

Regardless, I'd still come back. My mouth doesn't water when I hear the name but it gets the job done."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is probably one of the more authentic eateries that we've come across in the area.  They've got a large selection of items available but its done tapas style.  Ordering can quickly lead to an order of 6 items for 2 people and a bill of $30. But hey, its actually pretty worth it.  The tortillas are handmade, the cheese is authentic and isn't the typical orange and white cheese blend you're used to.  It amazed me that a kitchen so small was able to pump out food in such qty and volume. 
One of the things that made this place an experience was the menu.  If you're not good at deciding, try to get a glance at the menu or a picture of it while you're in line.  Usually, you don't see it until you're on deck for ordering @ the register and trying to make up your mind with 2 or 3 items that seem familiar can throw you."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A must stop when driving north. Have had better tacos out here in LA, like La Estrella in Pasadena, but because the meat tastes fresh and the tortillas are made on the spot, it has distinct flavor to it that you crave for. Hard to describe.

Must admit that once I did drove all the way from LA to SB just to have tacos from here. Weird."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The tacos were okay..the pork.. Not bad, nothing spectacular.
But the chicken quesadilla and the veggie quesadilla - they didn't look like much of anything but they were 5 star deliciousness!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I needed to check it out because of all the hype over so many years. 

Yes, its good, simple, fresh, straight forward Mexican. But the wait is painfully long. Fortunately, last time we were there, we found a family with similarly aged kids in front of us who's dad took our kids to the near by park to pass the time until it was our turn."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We were ready to brace the crowd until we found the place and sa wonky four people lining outside, yes!!!!
easy parking
great menu
handmade tortillas are so good and light
the guy who takes our order was very helpful, attentive, friendly (but not talkative) and patient (I asked too much about the tacos)
we sampled almost all the tacos (haha)we ordered pork, beef, chicken, super Rica, quesadilla and tamales and they are all delicious, authentic and perfectly cooked.

yes please visit this place when you're in town"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My cousin recommended that we try this place while on our visit to Santa Barbara, and the Yelpers seemed to like it too, so we stopped by for a late dinner (8:30 pm).  Because it was a stormy evening, we had no trouble finding parking, and the restaurant only had a few customers.  Awesome!  

The grill is directly behind the ordering window, so you can see them prepare your food.  Best part is that that they make their tortillas fresh and made-to-order, right in front of your eyes.  

Here's what we ordered:
#8: Alambre de Pechuga (grilled chicken breast with bell pepper, onions and mushrooms and 3 tortillas - $5.80.  The grilled chicken and veggies were piled high on top of the 3 tortillas.  We did not have a clue on how to eat it, so we just used our fork and knives.  We tried to be discreet, because if the employees saw us eating it this way, they probably would have kicked us out, or died from laughing so hard.  It was soooo good - it tasted fresh, it was hot, and a lot for $5,80.

 #1: Tacos de Bistec (tender strips of grilled steak served on two homemade tortillas - $2.50.  I could not believe how much meat they gave for the price.  The meat was flavorful and the tortillas were soft.  

I wish we could get great Mexican food like this in Hawaii."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It's a Dive with a capital D. But it's very popular, so expect to stand in line. Ordinarily the Duke doesn't stand in line for anyone, but sometimes you have to bend to please your old lady. But it was cool. They have their scene together, they know what they're doing, and they keep the line moving at a pretty good clip. The service was actually pretty fast, and the food was dam good.

I had plain carne asada tacos and my companion had the stuffed chile thing they do so well. The meat was cooked right, the home made tortillas were excellent and the salsas and chips were lackluster. The stuffed chile was also excellent. Yeah it's pretty great for a run down taco stand and they have earned their fame and popularity.

peace"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I believe I am in the minority about this place. I came here from Los Angeles with my girlfriend's parents as they had heard that this place has some good tacos and that the food was really well prepared. I got there hoping to have great tacos and great food, as a Mexican I hold all places in high regards when they call themselves Mexican food. 
I was sadly disappointed. The meat was flavorless and the hand made tortillas were a great disappointment (yes they can be messed up if the masa isnt prepared properly). All the salsas come from a can and have no flavor or spice whatsoever. The horchata is also from a bag and not freshly made. I cannot believe that so many people actually like this food. Next time I want decent tacos ill just fire up my grill in the back yard."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Famous for a reason, and now immortalized in a Katy Perry song.

This establishment has been around for quite a while. Visited here once in 2004, and then most recently almost 10 years later. This spot is just a wooden hut with a line snaking out the door. Food is still the same. Given SB's status as the American Riviera, celebrities can regularly be spotted here.

Overall, decent Mexican fare at Santa Barbara prices. Okay to stop by if you happen to be in SB, but not worth the drive up from LA or SD. Better Mexican can be found elsewhere."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"When my friend (in real life but also Yelp and FB) popped up with new review, I looked back to find mine and I'm not sure if it's been filtered (I almost never see that happen), or I just blogged about it but never wrote a review. 

But with all due respect to the wonderful Doug--a great guy and gourmet alike--La Super Rica SUCKS. 

Julia Child is the ONLY REASON this place is still around and doing a booming business. It continues to be on ""must hit"" places and the New York Times mentioned it yet again in the last year.  And as he noted it was over 20 years ago she made a big deal about it. 

It is a cockroach incubator for one thing, a phrase I got from a Wisconsin FB and phone friend as well as huge gourmet and foodie. Extremely nice staff. But people who go there are tourists. 

I tried it again after some 15 years and remembered why I didn't go there thereafter. And it's NOT cheap. My lunch was 10 bucks. I mean that's no big thing but for 10 bucks I can get much better Mexican food elsewhere. 

Affirmatively BAD guacamole. Not subpar. Bad. 

I will never go there again. I tried a squash taco special and it was goupy and greasy. 

They should donate to Julia Child charities and kneel in prayer daily. That dear woman who knew all food except, apparently, Mexican food and did them a huge favor. 

Lines are dreadful. Parking also sucks. 

There is so little good to say."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Everything is tasty and very affordable. Guacamole and nacho is awesome and their salsa is refreshing. #16 is really outstanding and definitely worth ordering.

The downside - there'll be most likely a long line when you order, also if you ever need a bio break. So, be patient."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,A must go when visiting SB. A casual little spot but the food is incredible from the tacos to any of the specials you really can't go wrong.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Impressive, most impressive, but you are not a jedi yet. May have been a bit different when Julia Child ate here. Homemade tortillas fried up in front of your face! Plus. Got the pork adobado tacos. Tashty. Complaints: overpriced, took too long, no toppings like diced onion, cilantro and lime (just ask and they'll give you some). Overall, nice work Mexico."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Isodoro and Martin have made this such a warm experience. Great guys and the restaurant lives up to its name: super rich. I think Julia Child loved it because these guys know how to use bacon, cream and cheese in their dishes. I've had an amazing veggie quesadilla here, and love the Especial. Best way to try chorizo if you've never had it. Tacos are basic and tasty. The prices feel like they haven't changed in 20 years, meaning you can get good reasonable good here. Thus the line out the door!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My friends & I had a wedding to attend in Santa Barbara, so we decided to stop by here for a quick snack. No regrets there.

The line was long and slow, but that gave us time to decide what we wanted. The tacos are delicious. There's spicy pork! Get the super rica special. I think that's one of their popular dishes. We also got the queso. Added this to my taco and it was yummy.

Note: Cash only! Street parking. Katy Perry likes this place (if that matters to you)."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Totally overrated.  Line was wayyyy too long.  I should have known better when I noticed the line was full of mostly white people.  Perhaps these are tourists that read about this place on yelp or guidebooks.  Food was nothing to write home about.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"La Súper-Rica has fantastic carnitas and was the favorite dish of our meal. The prices are reasonable, plenty of seating, only 3 parking spots which is not good. The salsa choices are very good. Definitely try La Super-Rica and let us know what you think."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,If Julia child liked this place well ... I definitley see why. The food is solid but you really have to patient to wait in line until you place an order.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Overrated! They got my order wrong.  Not a good way to start my day! Line is LONG!   I've had better. Place is crazy expensive. Each taco is $2.50. Small bottle Soda is $2
I ordered 7 tacos, 1 horchata and 2 coke bottles since they are so small, I paid $31.54!  Way too much for $30 worth of food. In my opinion."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,By far one of the best fresh authentic Mexican food I've had. Simple menu. Cash only. Simply amazing!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"bomb! everything, bomb! not just me, I work at a hotel and send all my guests here who come back just raving about the place... If you haven't been, GO!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but this place is pretty damn good.  I got the special sauteed mushroom tacos, a veggie tamale with cream sauce, and a quesadilla.  They were all about 1.50 - 2.00, so quite reasonably priced.  The quesadilla was as expected, the veggie tamale was quite good, and the mushroom tacos were frankly awesome.  My compatriots had roasted chicken tacos and a bowl of melted cheese and bacon.  I'm not sure what a bowl of melted cheese and bacon is called, but if I ate meat I would've been all up in dat.   Their Seven Up was fresh out of the can."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,came here after a splendid spa day and it was the perfect way to end a trip to santa barbara...
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The hand made tortillas were enough to make me love this place. The menu is a little disorienting at first but it breaks down into plain meat tacos, meat and cheese quesadilla, and tamales. The meat was wonderful. The steak was super tender and flavorful. The pork was a little fatty, bit worth I for the flavor. My favorite was the melted cheese. It was more sharp than a traditional queso fresco, an really made them stand out above the plain tacos. There are definitely no frills at this place. Old school, but being done right."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Wanted to try this place based on the reviews I've read about it and I am glad we did.  At almost 3pm on a Friday there was still a line at this place.  If you don't know it's there you will miss it.  I did not see any name near the entrance. You order as you go in.  There is a board listing the menu.  We ordered a number 2, 4, 7, 10, and 12 which are a steak taco, marinated pork taco, grilled tri-tip with bell peppers, onions and bacon taco, grilled chorizo with melted cheese (quesadilla), and grilled chicken breast quesadilla.  They also had watermelon agua frescas that we ordered.  The tortillas are made in-house and the food is cooked to order.  The agua fresca is very refreshing and tasted oh so good.  The tacos are BOMB especially #7 and the chorizo quesadilla...mmm...mmm..mmm. so delish! The meat serving is very big so you can make two tacos from one order. Their pico de gallo is fresh and the hubby loved the red salsa.  You can order guacamole on the side if you wish.  I see why Julia Child loves this place.  If you only have time to visit one place in SB make it La Super-Rica."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Seriously good food.  Hand made tortillas.  Worth the wait in line and the wait for the food.  Don't know what more to say other than 5 stars, all the time, every day, all day.  Delicious!!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  My girlfriend and I thought this place might live up to the hype when we saw people waiting outside before it even opened, but after waiting in line for 30 minutes it fell flatter than an 8-1/2 x 11 sheet of copy paper.  Salsa was weak, tacos were plain to say the least, and the suiza and quesadillas were bland.  I would never wait in that long line again.  If you think that this place has great food, you have obviously never had great food.  The taco truck that comes by my work everyday at noon has better fare than La-Super Rica.  Marginal at best.  Maybe they should drop the ""Super"" from the name."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Sadly bland and overrated.  Must have been better back in Julia's day.  We prefer El Bajio or Lily's
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Loved it!  Sure you need cash but who cares?  A place like that does not need to swipe cards to make people happy.  I enjoyed the Chorizo quesadilla.  There rice lacked a little flair but add some of their chile to it, and WOW.  I loved it.  LOVED IT!!! Would go again.  I was in town from Chicago for a wedding but I stayed for the tacos."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The food was great, but I just can't give them 5 stars due to the long wait. I know, I know, that's what you expect when you eat at La Super Rica. It's quality food & it's fresh.  

The portions here are small so be sure to order a few items. My favorite was the #16 and the #10. Simple but great...and surprisingly spicy! 

If I were really hungry, I think I would order 4 items from the menu just for myself. It would be a real bummer to wait all that time & realize that you didn't order enough food.

Rule of thumb: If you don't see many mexicans eating at a Mexican restaurant then you might want to reconsider the ""authencity"" of the food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Food was good, don't expect a lot of food for your money. The proportions were accurately sized for what we should eat but I definitely could've had two tamal de veduras (vegetable tamales). It was creamy and delicious but light. 

Make sure one person in your group continues to the outside patio so you can find a spot. We were lucky enough that a spot opened up for us when we got out there but you might have to elbow your way in."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Absolutely amazing ! 
Must stop every time I'm in Santa Barbara sometimes twice a day even . Attention to detail and fresh ingredients is impeccable."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Over rated. Food was bland and the selection is limited based on the day. No chiliquales or interesting tacos on Sunday.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I like that they make the hand made tortillas but flavor wise I am not impressed, I went there twice but I can't think of anything that would want to make me go over and over again"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,My all-time favorite Mexican food. Try the Especial.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It was good but would I stand in line for hours or fly in from some far away place - heck NO!!!

Just too much hype and they are one lucky place because of it. 

I don't eat meat so there was not a lot of choices for me. But even if I did, I don't see what the big deal is about. 

One thing I do give them credit for that they only take cash. These cash only places usually have people lining up like Tito's Tacos in LA. It's not a law that businesses can't take cash only!

And yes, there are much better Mexican places in the area."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Excellent Mexican Food - even as a vegetarian!

99% of the time you will encounter a long line that runs around the restaurant, but when you get to the front, be prepared to be amazed by the great food, friendly workers, awesome prices and the BEST pico de gallo!

Super Rica is a MUST whenever I'm in Santa Barbara."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,First time - but won't be the last! Everything was just delicious. Don't let the long lines scare you off - it was totally worth the wait.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What an absolute gem of a place! Not to be missed. Well worth the wait. Get #16 w/ Marinated Pork, the Tamale, and the Chile Relleno. Simply out of this world. They only take cash, BTW, so carry some. I'd give it 6 stars if I could."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The best food experience in our latest trip.
We were driving back, and stopped by to grab some food. Did not know anything about this place. They had just closed, and we did not know as people were still eating food. They allowed us to order and we had one of the best veggie tamales ever !!!
Thank you for your hospitality, service, and warm and amazing food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fresh tortillas? Amazing filling varieties? Fast service? What's not to love! This is an amazing place to get a genuine, no frills taco. Their menu does extend past tacos, but I have yet to try it. (Do note, however, that this is a cash only establishment.)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I waited OVER AN HOUR almost TWO HOURS for my food and it wasn't worth it. Yelp has failed me for the first time ever. I thought it would be worth it cuz so many people were waiting in line. I don't get it. Who the hell has the time to wait this long for their food?? Do they really think it's worth it?? 

One of my friend's told me to go to Freebirds instead of La Super Rica....I should have listened to her."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Browsing for some other restaurants in SB for an upcoming lunch brunch w/ the sig others fam - I just got sidetracked when I saw this place on yelp and had to write a review. About 3 1/2 years ago we stopped here on our way back to SF. This place is good - I gotta tell you it's been several years and I still remember those taco's - not your normal taco stand. I highly recommend it.

We were a touch nervous at first because it wasn't your normal fare - but you know what nothin tastes better than a taco served on a fresh tortilla. The woman behind the counter was whipping those things out. Tasty."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Perhaps one of the best taco places in the US. Why? They don't give a shit about how long the line is (I tried to go in 2007, but gave up because of a 2 hour wait). They haven't remodeled the kitchen since they've opened - one flat top and one grill. The dining room is a framed in concrete slab covered with a tarp. They don't go out of their way to be nice to you. And don't even think about paying with a credit card. 

Every goddamn ounce of focus is on the food. Plus, Julia Child loved it too.

And, I guess, the food. thin-sliced chicken quesadillas, the chunks of chorizo bathed in a warm runny cheese sauce, hot messes of pork with peppers and onions, handmade tortillas, and wait for it, tamales that could kill a man, woman, or child. The menu is simple but deep. These people are masters at using cheese.

Amazing. If I ever get a private jet, this is on my short list of lunch spots."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Moved away from Santa Barbara years ago and still miss La super-Rica.  It was our go to place and they have the best beans ever, get there early or they run out."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Visited twice. It's one the coolest restaurants ever. It's a cheap dive, mom-and-pop stand, and authentic taqueria all at once. You can watch the staff make corn tortillas with their press, chop meat, and make everything on the spot. Prices are pretty good, about $5.75 for a larger chicken or beef tacos dish and under $2 for a smaller two-taco dish, although you'll probably want to order two things. An order of guacamole is a good idea to share around the table. Everything tastes homemade and authentic.

The staff is bilingual and service is pretty fast, just a few minutes. Very cool place!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Yes.  Do it.  Went because it was referenced in psych, but they were the best tacos I have ever had.  Everything is amazing, right down to their homemade tortillas."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I liked the tortilla. When you taste something freshly made, it's usually good anyway.

We ordered this daily special, it's something with chicken and mole sauce($7). The dish reminded me of Red Iguana Salt Lake city. I had to try the mole because I only had that once in my life which was at SL city. I think La Super-Rica makes better.

We also ordered 2 tacos with chorizo and 2 tacos with spicy pork($2.50 each taco). When I got the tacos, I was very surprised to see nothing was on top of them. It was served meat and tortilla only and they were very small tacos.

The spicy pork taco was not bad, but the rest of dishes were definitely not a life changing experience. On top of that, I think the meal was over priced.

I won't come back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Super wonderful end to a perfect day in Santa Barbara. Here's what we had:

Chile Relleno w/cream sauce special - Amazing! 

Posole- so good I wanted to get some to go but the line was too long when we finished our meal. 

Beans- yummy perfection

Beef Tacos Deshebrada Special - excellent tender shredded beef. 

Tacos de Costilla - good, not my favorite but my daughter and husband liked them

Quesadilla - passed the kiddo taste test. 

All the salsas were fresh and yummy!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place is a solid taqueria spot but I would not say it's the best.  What its got going is that It's a total no frill place with good homemade Mexican food a la Mexico City style taste.  

The food is definitely regional to Mexico's Capital city DF which is a cosmopolitan city that blends all foods of Mexico into... you especially taste and experience this when you get into the rajas crema/cheese and the tamales with veggies and meat and the rice with that slight oregano taste...yummmmm.  Love the fresh homemade tortillas and the horchata is like like liquid pudding.

Now the meats I ordered (bistek - closest thing to carne asada, and the adobada- closest thing to al pastor) were lacking seasoning and fell bland to the taste buds... but the pico de gallo salsa took care of the blandness... and the pace is SLOWWWW! 

From what I hear the spot will be featured on some food network show soon... so get on over there to expand your Mexican food repertoire  before the lines are impossible!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could, but I just can't give La Super-Rica 4 stars. For one, it is not a bad place, and is obviously a popular destination among Santa Barbarans; as evidenced by the long line that snakes out to the corner. The food was surprisingly affordable for being in Santa Barbara and they had a great selection of beer (they even had Dos Equis!). I ordered their Alambre de Pechuga, which I thought was going to be bursting with flavor. However, this was the reason it did not get four stars. My food was lacking a bit in flavor, it was greasy, and portions were still on the small side but you do get what you paid for. Also, they are cash only, which can be a pain-in-the-a** for plastic users like me. The place was more convenient to me rather than a favorite. Maybe it was the dish I ordered? Or were my expectations to high for this attempt at Mexican food in Santa Barbara? Well, they must be doing something right since they are loved by many Santa Barbarans that frequent this place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Is it legal to have this much cheese in one place? Oh man... this place. It's not for the faint of heart. 

I was super excited about this place because my friend raved about how amazing the corn tortillas were. In my head, I'm like ""youdunnome! corn tortillas are the worst! so dry, so thick."" nah.. I stand corrected. This place makes it amazing. The corn tortilla is very very fresh - they make it right there in fact. It's light, not grainy. It was so easy to eat! 

As happy as I was with the tortilla, BAM! My friend didn't tell me the most amazing part are all the specials they have. I saw them laying out the little plastic bowls in the kitchen. I saw a cook hold a little pot, squishing it around before he poured out a very thick and resistant concoction. Wallah! #25! Guess those 3 bowls each had that gooey substance, and they were all to be a part of me soon - and seriously a part of me like straight to my hips business.

I found out all that stuff going on was cheese! That made the main dishes. Sure they'd alter it and flavor it up with meat (bacon, chorizo) or veggies (tomato), but holy sh*t it was a bowl of thick thick cheese that solidifies if you don't put it away fast enough. Of all the 3, I enjoyed the cheese with tomato the most (#16). I liked the heavy cheese + acid balance. There was also a bit of soup (I'm assuming it's butter) on top of the cheese that just made for a nice pre-game before slapping all that goodness onto a corn tortilla. The chorizo (#13) was my next fave because I just like chorizo, and it's so hard to find. It was the same concept - cheese & an ingredient. The bacon (#14 tocino) just was too much for me. It had a really really strong smokey flavor and it drowned out the cheese which became all texture. You actually see the bacon grease solidify in the bowl, and that's when I regretted my cheese x3 decision... Great concept, but one especial is enough for one trip, I think (I'm Asian. Factor in the lactose biz).

We also got the Pasole - special of the day which had stewed pork, hominy, red cabbage, onion, & crispy tortilla - because we needed something normal to counter all the fat we were digesting. Great choice. It had vegetables, which made me amazingly (surprisingly) happy. It's a stew-kinda dish. I really liked the broth - rich, developed, but with subtle flavor. Mix that soup with the raw onions and yumm... what a great moment. It tasted even better with a crispy tortilla crunch. I'd definitely recommend it.

I had to wait a bit, but it was worth an experience. The staff is extremely nice - it's a small family establishment. This place is intense (food-wise, just get 1-2 especials at a time), but they're great for what/who they are. Divey hole in the way with solid food near the beach? Check. Every coast has one... this is it for SB.

PS. Not a fan of the salsa bar. Limited options (3 - 2 salsas & one pico de gallo) and not very unique, or 'wow yeah I want this in my taco'. I did enjoy the green sauce though because it was very limey & acidic, which was just what I needed to go with the fat I ate."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Um no...just no. Please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor & skip this place unless you're really hungry for flavorless fake Mexican food.  Maybe they ran out of salt...and pepper ...and garlic...and every other seasoning that even the most cooking-challenged person has somewhere in their pantry.  I should've known (& genuinely mean no offense to non-hispanics) that this place would disappoint when my husband said he was the only ""brown"" person waiting in line...for almost an hour. Don't let the Mexicans in the kitchen fool you...this is not authentic. But if you're ok with that, that's cool. Heck that's not even my biggest gripe.  If was the lack of flavor or just plain salt! Never again."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Tortillas were great and the service was friendly but why did it take 20 mins for 2 tacos? The pork tasted very familiar with the hint of cloves. Does this ring any bells? Alittle like Chipolte 
i would go back for the tortillas alone"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,We come here every time we pass through Santa Barbara--the best tacos anywhere!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Every dish is excellent, so delicious and their outside covered patio is wonderful.  Love those handmade tortillas and the quacamole, omg."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place was reviewed once by Julia Child, which kick started Super Rica's popularity. I didnt know about this place of course, my friend took me here for lunch. By first impressions, there was a line ... that took what seemed like forever to just order the food. It seemed like prices were cheap, reviews on yelp seemed good as well, but I just didnt think it was worth it. The portions were really small, we waited what seemed like forever. My friends also thought the food had decreased in quality since the last time they went. How long does it take to make some chicken, warm up the tortilla, and put them together? 

I'm a huge taco junkie, and this place just didnt cut it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Since I can only be in Mexico once a year, this is the next best place for street food!  All the tacos I have had are very good, fresh, made with quality ingredients.  I like to get a carne asada taco and a rajas taco and mix them up, not authentic, but soooo good.  And a beer!  I don't care if there's a line, it's all worth it!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I have to say, the yelp community really hyped this place up.  I guess I was expecting much more from this place than what I got.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, and semi-reasonably priced (though a bit on the pricey side).  I just wasn't blown away.  The good is good... would I make an entire trip to Santa Barbara JUST to eat here?  NO.  But I would stop by if I'm ever in the neighborhood again.  Would I wait in line for over an hour to eat here again? No way.  

The food quality was high, the meats tender, and well marinated, and the flavors were good. I've had better at less famous taco shops.  So go here, but don't wait in line for too long... it's not worth it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I love this place. They do a bowl with half rice half beans... I could eat that with a little avocado on top and a couple of their handmade tortillas everyday! My favorite part is watching them make the tortillas with the huge mound of fresh masa. My only word of warning: they are closed both tuesdays and wednesdays now -- online it says wednesdays only. May just be for winter - but plan accordingly - you do not want to miss!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"My friend said that this was the place to go if we wanted to eat tacos. The line was not that long once we got there. The elderly gentleman that takes the order is a bit slow, but very nice and helpful. We ended up waiting about five to eight minutes in line. I ordered the grilled chicken with melted cheese in between two hand made tortillas. My friend ordered two steak tacos. Needless to say, the portions are small. The food was really good, but a bit pricey with the kinds of portions that were given. One taco was about $2.50. I could have given this review a full five stars on taste alone, but the small portions are the down side if you are really hungry. If you aren't the type to overeat and indulge on food, then the portions are just right. Either way, I do recommend this place, but be prepared to bring a lot of money if you want more portions. I ended up spending close to $20 when all we had was two tacos, grilled chicken, two horchatas and a side of guacamole. I know places that are cheaper and portions are larger for what we ordered."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Get the number 6 Rojas... your welcome.  The guac is fresh but flavor didn't pop for me.  I mixed some of the pico juice into it and it was on point.   Also, pro-tip, You can order fresh made chips for $1.20."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A very different mexican food. We ordered - #6, with chile and cheese (Delish!), #4 with pork (good), chilly relleno with cheese (BEST), tamales pork (ok but the fish tamal looked better over sauce). I loved it but husband not so much."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Who am I to second guess Julia Child on (legend has it) her favorite restaurant. Authentic Mexican tortillas, hand made. Tacos and fillings all delicious. Ordered tri tip, elote corn, pork, chorizo. Be prepared to stand in line and eat on patio. Very unpretentious and very good."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"WARNING:does not live up to the hype. Just because Julia Childs says something is good does not make it so. Waited over an hour for my food which was tiny and tasted just like any mediocre tacos would. Can't believe all the hype, go to lilly's tacos instead or better yet shell out a little more and try Los agaves just down the street, you will not be disappointed!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,This is a GRINGO tourist trap. Locals don't eat here and the food can be greasy and over priced.  Don't wast your $$ or time with all the good food and fine dining.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This local taqueria is fresh, delicious, and their food is unique for it's type. Yes, there will be a long line. Just get in it. Everything I tried was delicious. Probably not the healthiest of options, but who goes to a taqueria for their health? I stopped people at another table to ask what they got cuz it looked so good and I'm definitely adding a #13 to my regular stuff next time. Worth the wait!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Delicious homemade corn tortillas!!!! Food was super rica :)
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,After watching Adam on Man Vs. Food going through the Pacific Coast Highway we decided we wanted to eat at the places he went too.  We tried the first place in Malibu and that was a huge disappointment and a waste of money and time!  Our stop was in Santa Barbra La Super Rica we were thinking about skipping this place since we did not enjoy the last place.  I am so glad that we did not skip this place!! We visited here on 10/10/2011 which was a Monday so there were no big lines!  As you walk in you can smell all the YUMMY food!! We were only going to order one thing and taste it first then order more if liked it since the last place was gross but as soon as we smelled and seen the food that idea went out the door!! It really is a hole in the wall and very easy to pass. There are no pictures of Man Vs. Food being here why? I don't know.. I also did not see that he only accepts cash so for those of us that use your debit card be ready to pay cash or check... Check? (what is that) lol  The good thing is that there was an ATM about a 4 min walk.  I ordered a chile relleno in white sauce WOW this was super good oh and a side of their homemade tortillas.  My husband ordered #16 what Adam had on the show now he liked it but I myself didn't really care for the marinated pork I guess it's suppose to be Alpastor but I have had way better. It did have a different flavor them your usual alpastor it was good but I like the alpastor I grew up with.  I also did not care for the salsa's they were good but for the food to be this great I expected more on the salsa's.  To drink we ordered agua de Jamaica this was so good it tasted like the Jamaica paletas!! I loved it!! We will for sure be here again!!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Yuuuuuuh!!! My all time favorite spot since I was a kid. I LOVE their pechuga suissa!! The best chicken quesadilla in town hands down!  They're horchata is delicious. They do have a few select beers and they only accept cash. The tortillas are hand made in front of you.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Over two years after my last visit, and I finally made it back to La Super-Rica. TWICE! Yes, I am the luckiest girl in the world.

I must say, La Super-Rica is just about the only 'legendary' cult favorite restaurant that I have ever felt lived up to its reputation. Heck, I'd say it exceeds its reputation. Its menu is innovative; they have unique and frequently-changing specials, like a tamal wrapped in banana leaf, stuffed with chicken and raisins. This is not some two-bit taco stand, though it is priced as though it is. Well, tacos are a touch expensive at $2.50 a pop. But still, yum.

Today, I am salivating with the thought of my las rajas-- pasilla chilies, cheese, caramelized onions, and herbs on two tortillas. It was really ugly on the plate, and I worried that I ordered incorrectly. But alas, it was amazing. Flawless. Yum. 

I love you."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,We were lucky enough to be told about this local gem while we were in town. Great food and the best horchata ever! I just wish they made flour tortillas ;)
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Sorry Mai but Im going to copy you

""Without going into too much detail the food was very bland. The meats had spices galore but everything really lacked salt. Not that I love salty food but come on!  You have to have some salt in meat.  Even all the salsa in the world with copious amount of beer couldn't have made the food taste better.  ""

most Los angeles mexican food so far have been disgusting but this food was tasteless and the tamales had cloves!!! the so called mexican style rice was bland the guacamole had no salt the meat was bland this place is OVER RATED

oh yeah and when we went there was no burritos or veggie tamales, and yeah the lack of mexicans usually gives you a clue about the authenticity and taste"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A must stop when I visit my parents. I've been going since I was a weee lassie. I remember the original owner taking the orders and always saying hi to my dad. (I think the current person who takes the orders is his son.) Hands down best taco de adobada and lomito suizo. The tamal de verdura is really really good which is what I ordered and a taco de calabacita. Since I have been going for years, I know the routine as far as ordering. But I do wish that they had a menu outside, either at the window, so newbies can check out the menu instead of holding up the line at front. Other than that, it is as good as it gets and a must when in Santa Barbara."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The name is exactly how I would describe the food.  SuperRich Tacos.  It is a cult classic and has a very loyal following.  Remember to bring cash and be prepared to wait.  In a town with over 40 Mexican food establishments La Super-Rica is unique, authentic and a bona-fide destination for some foodies."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"So delicious! The chorizo taco was the best- I think the simpler the dish, the better. The horchata was also delicious.  Everything is very cheap and very good."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"They had about five things that were vegetarian on the menu. We loved the Rajas and the vegetarian tamales. The Gorditas were decent. The chile con queso was delicious. Very casual atmosphere and very affordable. The corn tortillas were freshly made. Note that they only accept cash for payment. Pretty long lines, but food came out quickly.."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I got the #11 and it was pretty good. The marinated pork was good. Wasn't to thrilled on the guacamole, I've had better."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Don't believe the hype. Super plain guacamole and tacos :( Even the salsa was bland. The Jamaica tasted like syrup. The only good thing about this place were the tortillas and that's something you can ry get anywhere. Go to Monys instead!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Only after waiting in the infamously long line for 30 minutes and ordering my food did I find out Super RIca only accepts cash or check. As of last weekend, there was no signage anywhere stating this policy.  

The food is pretty good. Simple, homemade, and worth the wait.

Not that this has bearing on the quality of the restaurant itself, but having to listen to obnoxious rich people book-ending me in line talk about ""slumming it with the riff-raff"" (aka coming to eat at Super Rica) pretty much ruined my experience."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Julia child's favorite restaurant.  this should tell you something.  do not expect fancy white table clothes.  this used to be a taco cart. now converted into a makeshift restaurant.  

long long lines.  worth the wait:

taco de chorizo= YUM
queso fundido= share it with someone you love
tamales= mmmmmmmm
anything on the menu=  try it just once

you will be back for mre"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The food was ok. I think it's overrated, but I can't help and compare it to La Taqueria in San Francisco. I had to experience and taste the food, which I did. It is was just ok."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I've been coming here for years since I was little with my family when we would head to Santa Barbara. I wish I could give this place more stars. Everything I've tried or have gotten is delish. And the prices are pretty good. The only down side is you'll have to wait in a long line but it's definitely worth the wait.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"ATMOSPHERE:
Casual, cute, order at the counter. 

SERVICE:
Even when there's a line out the door (which there always is thanks to a shout out years ago from Julia Child) the food comes out within minutes of sitting down after loading up at the salsa bar. 

FOOD:
Super tasty, but regardless of the meat or veggies chosen, the star of the show is the freshly made tortillas for every order. Don't believe me? You can see them being made as you order :) 

OVERALL:
Excellent place for taco lovers."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I make it a point stop here every-time I'm in town. It is by far Barbara's hidden gem. Everything here is delicious! I recommend the Super-rica plate. It has bell pepper, marinated pork, and cheese in three freshly hand made tortillas. It's a must try! The only thing I don't like is the tamale. Being from LA I've have to say I've tasted better tamales. They put this sauce on top the tamale that I just can't bring myself to like. I guess it's an acquired taste. Oh and since the first time I was here 10+years...it seems like the portions have gotten smaller."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is and should be a California landmark.  The family, the history and the deliciousness of the food are five star. 

It's a local favorite and we want to keep it that way because the lines are too long as they are, but we understand. It's  freaking great!

Julia child use to visit and so many chefs....grab a seat, pay the extra money and enjoy every dish. The sopes are like no other. Only on Tuesdays!  And have the Mexican coffee and tacos de rajas. ...list goes on.

I've been eating here since I was five. And my parents drive from Riverside three hours... to just eat here for the memories of their past and the unique twist of this food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Just had the #16 superica especial. We got there at 11 am and the line was already pretty long. There is a reason the line was out the door - great Mexican food. The pico de gallo is really fantastic. Make sure you take cash since they don't take credit or debit. Definitely worth the wait!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I think sometimes places get over-rated based on historical lore, such as Julia Child's famed visit here. Yeah, the tacos are good and certainly freshly made (you can watch!) and that's worth a lot. Fun little indoor patio for seating at white plastic tables, neat experience. But for me. Just 4 stars."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Super Rica is an institution in Sb! best salsa ever!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Been going to La Super-Rica for years. Food is superb and very reasonably priced (just remember to bring cash, credit cards not accepted). Order the watermelon agua fresca, it's a very refreshing non-alcoholic compliment to the meal. Everything on the menu is fresh and top notch. There is also a nice range of special items, beyond what is on the fixed menu. Timing is everything if you don't care to wait in line. Generally, if you are there when they open, or during non-peak hours, there is little-to-no wait time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Good but not special. We stopped here on the way to Paso Robles. Travel and Leisure mentions their squash tamales (a special not listed on the board) which I had and my husband had the Super Rica Especial. His was the tastier of the two. Roasted pasilla and pork! Long wait that did move but still took ~ 2 hours from start of the line to end of the meal.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I saw a line and stood at the end of it. 

That's basically how I found out about this place. 
I live in LA and one weekend I was kinda feeling adventurous so I decided to spend a day wandering around Santa Barbara. I looked up some Yelp reviews and decided to check out a place called Los Agaves. I got there and ordered this dish called Molcajete because one of the reviewers recommended it. When I got it, I was like WTH? Is this some kind of soup? And why would they give tortilla with it? Everything falls out when I try to take a bite because it's too liquidy. Anyway, I felt like an idiot so I got that in a container to go. 

But while I was looking for parking, I remember seeing a line coming out of this shack (turns out to be La Super-Rica Taqueria) since it was on the same street as Los Agaves. So on my way back to my car I decide to leave my leftover and wait in line to check this place out. I couldn't even see the menu until I was almost at the cash register, but the line went slowly and thankfully I had plenty of time to make a choice by the time it was my turn. 

I ordered a #6, 7, and 18. 
#6 Rajas- not bad, the ingredients were creamy and kinda mushy, but still pretty tasty
#7 Alambre de Filete- I liked it better than #6; bigger dish, great flavors
#18 Guacamole- decent; not the best I had, but still pretty good 

If I go again, I think I'd try #16. I was on the fence about it while I was there, but I was kinda full from Los Agaves so I decided to pass. Overall it was a fun experience. The prices are reasonable and the tortillas are hand made in front of you."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Maybe it was the Julia Child connection or the 20+ minute wait in line, but I had high expectations for La Super-Rica, and sadly, I found the food to be just...okay.

The guacamole is indeed smooth like ""butter"" as another Yelper said, the horchata delightful, the vegetable tamal soaked in cheese, but none of the offerings I tried blew my mind. 

In short, it was a nice place for a casual and inexpensive lunch when in Santa Barbara, but it isn't a place to pilgrimage to, especially considering all of the other millions of solid Mexican spots in California."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My boyfriend and I stopped here as one stop on the tour of Santa Barbara wineries and we loved it. The pico de gallo has little jalapeno seeds so watch out for them. The tortillas were so soft and fluffy. They were out of this world. Really, they didn't taste like a regular tortilla or anything from this earth. Especially when they had a huge gob of green guacamole, which my boyfriend ate as a guacamole taco, because the whole thing was so deliciously edible. We had the steak and carnitas tacos. My boyfriend picked number 11 with the yummy green peppers. The whole thing was delicious. The horchata was so Cinnamon-y."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Meh.....with all these great reviews and location of the place, I was expecting a lot more flavor. Food was ok. At least I can say I tried it. Definitely my first and last time eating here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Obviously the line and being cash only are the biggest draw backs, but it is popular for a reason. Everything is hand made and very delicious, even for vegetarians. I recommend the vegetarian tamal and the spicy gordita de frijol. Also, the Mexican coffee is amazing and vegan friendly!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This is one of those places that you go to, wait in the like that looks like it should take 10 mins but takes 30 and you leave super disappointed. 

It's famous because it's Julia Child's favorite Mexican spot. Well, let me tell you something about Julia Child (besides her being a CIA agent), she was a huge fan of my ex's family so, based on that, you should know that her taste might be a little suspect. 

We liked the watermelon agua fresca and the coffee was good too but the meat tended to be chewy and bland. Actually I think bland describes most of the food here. Including the salsa. And for those of you who are all pumped about the home made tortillas, I'm sorry. 

One thing we got that we didn't expect was copious amounts of oil. So, I mean, extra negative bonus stars for that. 

I'd advise you to look elsewhere for Mexican food cuz this spot ain't the business."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My absolute favorite Mexican food. Hands down. I love the owners, the simple shack it's located in, the plastic chairs and the pico you scoop yourself. It's all part of the experience. I recommend the vegetable tamales, chorizo quesadilla and tri-tip tacos with their bacon-y goodness. (Also kid approved!)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Not too sure what they hype was.  The tortillas saved the day.  Those were great.  The taco's are pretty plain and boring.  Meat was exceptionally dry.   The sopes were pretty good.  Wonderful people run the place though.  Great little spot in that respect.  People say the cash only is a con... cash is king.  it always will be.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This unassuming little shack of a taco stand on the corner of Milpas only stood out because of the line out the door.  There are only three parking spaces in their tiny, tiny lot so if you score one of those, like we did, then you know you've got top-notch parking karma!

They make their own corn tortillas fresh here, but for a super casual-looking taco joint, that's about the extent of the authenticity of their tacos and tamales.  They have melty cheesy veggie tacos, melty cheesy bacon and other stuff tacos, some really great looking vegetarian stuff, and tamales.

Maybe it's not fair for me to have come here, since my taco faves center around lengua and cabeza and most recently eyeballs.  There's none of that here!  

Good for some, but not so good for me.

I got:

#1 - steak tacos
#2 - top sirloin tacos
#7 - tri tip, peppers, bacon
Guacamole

Because I didn't get the melty cheesy that others got (and that looked really good), the meat was all pretty dry and way overcooked to me.  I do have to say that my normally super salt sensitive palate was pleased that nothing was remotely salty - even the bacon one.  Though this could translate into bland for the normal palate.

The guacamole was great and fresh, but that's not hard to do.

If you like cheese or fresh tamales, and even are a vegetarian, I would highly recommend this taco place.  The fresh corn tortillas are definitely chewy and satisfying, and I'm sure the cheesy fillings are pretty good.  But personally I'll be going somewhere else in search of lengua, cabeza and eyeballs."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,It is NOT worth waiting in line to eat at this taqueria. The homemade corn tortillas were the highlight of the meal. Dry meat and pretty flavorless salsas. I really don't understand why this place has such a long wait.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The line was out the door around 2:30pm on a Sunday. It moved fairly quickly, taking about 15-20 minutes til we could order. After that it was maybe 5 minutes for our food to come out. 

THE COST: About $17 total for a light lunch for two.

1) Tacos de Bistec ($2.50) - 4 stars. A tad dry if I'm being picky, but the steak still had great flavor.
10) Quesadilla con Chorizo ($3.50) - 5 stars. Amazing chorizo! These are actually sliced sausages, and they are super rich. A bit heavy on the cheese, still great overall. 
16) Super-Rica Especial (chile pasilla, cheese, marinated pork. $6.80) - 4.5 stars. Definitely lots of pepper, but goes well w/ the cheese & pork. Comes w/ 3 tortillas, easily makes 3 taco's worth of food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Hands down, best mexican food ever!!!  Worth the wait in line and the stress of ordering just the right thing.  You can't go wrong.  Although, next time I'm all about 7, 11, and 18!  Yum!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"La Super Rica is the sorta place you plan day trips up the coast around. Always gotta stop, always hard to pass. I can't believe I forgot to review it until now. It deserves 5 stars because everything is fresh, the way it should be. I always enjoy exchanging pleasantries with the guys taking orders, they are super cool, always friendly (even when the line is around the block) and tell me the gordita is ""very spicy, ok?"" every single time I order it. The only negative thing about the place is that they are closed on Tuesdays. I wish I could somehow marry into the family so I could be a co-owner, or at least get that Chile Pasilla recipe."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I was worried about the wait when I was heading here (I've skipped this place on a previous trip when I saw people standing in a line that wrapped around the building), but I must have lucked out this time...or rather it was the late afternoon lull...either way, got in quick, ordered, and after a few gulps of diet Coke (would have preferred a Modelo but after a day of wine tasting I didn't have it in me), our order was up.  I'll be honest, I'm not a Mexican food connoisseur, but I've had a decent taco here & there.  And this place is better than most, at least outside of Mexico.  And the fresh corn tortillas...mmmm.  I liked that the food and ingredients were simple and filling.  But would I wait an hour...nah.  I'd say if you're going by & the line's not long, it's a great place to stop for a quick meal."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is OLD SCHOOL SB... Tourists and people who moved here from LA complain about the wait and god knows what else that's irrelevant. The tortillas are unreal, the cheese is delicious and the peppers are to die for. If you don't want to wait, go to Taco Bell!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Having the carne asada tacos was like having a fiesta in my mouth, super tasty and well done...mini tortillas were the right consistency - hot, not too damp, a bit of crisp. Delightful."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Simple, verging on really good home cooking in flavor and style. But good!!!! So good!! For what they do it's fantastic and the vibe is also really pleasant. I don't think I've ever been happier with a carnitas quesadilla. Just carnitas, queso, and excellent homemade tortillas. Love. 

On a different visit I tried the veggie tamale (on the specials). Had plenty of fresh squash and other fresh veggies, not over cooked! Very good and I loved the unique cream sauce on the tamale, I prefer not too much masa, and I don't like a dry tamale... so I like their sauce w/  adding some salsa, super fresh. 

Yes, overall they could be more flavorful and they tend to cook the meats pretty well...but never over done.  They're not heavy handed on marinating meats: my hubby would like that since marinates tend to bother him. For some people it's a make or break issue. So how they deal with their meats: simply. More like a preference thing. But this is not nouveau cooking. This is old school but not your typical 'Mexican restaurant' style either. So for that alone it's worth it. 

Both times I visited the line was pretty short maybe 5 people or less in front of us. My whole life I've visited SB, seen the crazy Line at this place and never got to try it. We lucked out and just went at non-rush times. It was a fun place for a late dinner, very casual hang with friends. And a great place for a 4pm stop and get some perfect carnitas quesadillas before heading back to LA. Guacamole was really yum. 

Frescas are SWEET, but I enjoyed it.  Liked the horchata, jicama was too sweet for me. I wish they had a little (to a lot) of real outdoor seating... the view just from the sidewalk towards the mountains w/ the palms, is really relaxing. That's about all I'd really change: have some outdoor, open sky seating.  And maybe have the veggie tamales every day (so I could always get them no matter what day of the week!) 

oh and if you like Mexican cheese...melted Mexican cheeses: this is your dream come true. They are not shy about how much cheese: if they say they're giving you cheese in the dish, be prepared....for a generous helping.  I heart La Super Rica."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Amazing.  I watched the lady as she made my tortillas, they were delicious!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My husband and I walked to the restaurant at night from the pier during a recent Santa Barbara trip.  Upon arriving he was dubious - it is basically a little standing room only building with a counter and kitchen, and I covered porch on the back with plastic tables and chairs.  Line wasn't too long, prices seemed reasonable, and we'd heard good things, so what the heck, we gave it a whirl.  Loved it - from the tiny lady making fresh tortillas one after the other, to the delicious food, to watching the diverse crowd (families, students, artsy types, tourists, people on dates, people with a group of friends, retirees) it was a melting pot of different types all enjoying the simple pleasure of some no frills mexican food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Don't pass this place up. It looks like nothing on the outside, but the food it fresh and delicious. Authentic and a high value. Very friendly service and there is a big selection to choose from. I really like the little taco/tostada that is made with the fresh corn tortilla and the grilled pasilla peppers. Yum."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Waited in a typical long and SLOW line. Despite being crowded, there were numerous empty tables...which indicates they aren't even filling orders fast enough to fill the seats!  The guy taking orders was incredibly slow...people were getting their orders and eating faster than he could take an order!  He was also in charge of the phone, so he would constantly there would be no one attending to the line wrapping down the block as he took phone orders and he took sometimes he just seemed to walk away for no reason. They were out of a bunch of stuff.  They ripped down the special sign from the window when the guy tried to order it.  Food was okay. Nothing to write home about. Some stuff was better than others, but nothing worth the hassle of this place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is the kind of place I wish I had access to back home. The food is authentic, simple, and fresh.  A friend and I shared some beef, pork, and chicken tacos.  All three were good, but since I was unfamiliar with the menu I didn't realize that the higher # options are the ones with cheese and veggies. Two of our orders were just meat and tortillas, which is a bit simpler than I prefer, but I was able to add guac and salsa to make it more to my liking. I would definitely go again, and I recommend not being in a hurry because there can be a long line.

Oh, and the horchata was delightful!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Oh Yeah!! Number 16 Super Rica Especial is the real deal-freshly made tortillas and marinated pork,green chiles and cheese.Mercy got the #7 Tri Tip which was great as well but you've got to try the Number 16."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Julia Child said it was her favorite masa in all the world. 'Nuff said. Simple, fresh, amazing, affordable. Grab some Horchata, a Modelo, and a seat. You will love it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I have eaten at this restaurant in the past on recommendation from Sunset magazine, but never again after this weekend's lunch.  The beans and rice were weak examples of these Mexican delicacies.  There was no grated cheese or sour cream to be found on the premises.  When I ordered the chili verdura, it came in a soupy broth.  I had to pour this off before I could even entertain eating this.  The carne asada tacos were just that, carne and nothing else.  Even the street taco guys give you salsa, cilantro and onion.  I will not be going back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Came here on a recommendation of a co-worker who's a UCSB grad.  Who better to know where all the great food is right?  Stopped here on the way up to do some wine tasting in the Santa Ynez Valley.  

Firstly, the menu is confusing for a first time visitor. A few other people in line made the same comment.  

Our group tried to order a variety of items.  Our meal was good. The meat was a little bland and so was the spanish rice.  It wasn't bad.  The tortilla was the best part.  You can truly taste that it was made right on the spot. 

Will I go back.  Sure.  
Will I go out of my way to drive there just for a taco.  Probably not."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I was really hoping to have a mind blowing mexican food experience based on the reviews I read.  But to be honest I was really disappointed.  Let me outline the food we had:
Pork taco
Steak taco
Guacamole
Lorizo (pork and cheese)
#16 Rica Especial

On the plus side the fresh tortillas were great.  But the food really had no flavor to it. The meats were bland and the other dishes were just meat and some cheese and without the salsa would have tasted really bad. The guacamole really sucked too. 

BTW: My baseline for awesome mexican are places which range from divy to fancy:
La Tacqueria - San Francisco
Puesta - San Diego
La Tapatia - San Bruno"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"First, I must say, Super Rica lives up to all of the hype. This family-run Mexican eatery serves up real quality food. The recommended Rajas, is a vegetarian dish that is so delicious and satisfying. Green chiles are grilled with onions, smothered with cheese and served over a pillowy corn tortilla. It sounds all too simple & plain, however, it has proven to be the contrary. 
A dish that cannot be missed is Super Rica's Pozole. It is hands-down THE BEST Pozole. The broth is thick and robust! All of the spices, citrusy lime juice, tender meat, hominy, and fresh shredded cabbage mixed together is perfection. Seriously, no other place could even compare. 
Chorizo fun dido is a caloric splurge but oh-so-worth-it. Who could resist melted cheese, chorizo and fluffy hand-made tortillas?! 

Pretty much anything on their menu board is going to be delicious. I'm so happy to eat here at least once a month. And waiting in line for about 15-minutes is absolutely normal and worth all the trouble."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,There are times that the place you eat at is written about is better than thr actual meal this  is one of  those places its a junky place with Mexican street vendor food. The portions were small and overpriced and just the basic. Below  average beams and rice for the price
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,The Super Rica has always been one of my favorite hole in the wall Mexican places- cheap and good! I'm especially a fan of the Pechuga Suiza and the Alambre de Filete. Fine dining it's not- but delish Mexican food!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Good enough for Julia Child, good enough for us...??? That should be a YES! but in this case, not so much!

We were in Santa Barbara and had passed over La Super Rica our last trip this way so it was a must this time.

Arrived around 4P to a short, slow moving line. We didn't order a ton since we had recently eaten and it's probably a good thing because nothing was really stand out amazing in any way.

We shared a #1 Taco, a cheese quesadilla and guacamole. Everything seemed a bit bland, but better with salsa.

The tortillas are definitely what made the best impression here but all in all not worth waiting for."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"After hearing only rave-reviews about this joint, I decided that I had to visit it and try it out at least ONCE before my time in Santa Barbara was up. I frequented this place on Cinco De Mayo with my BF who happens to LOVE Mexican food, with a passion. However, like myself, he was very disappointed in the food and mystified about all the hype that it has and still does receive. 
We arrived at 10:50 am, 10 minutes before it opened, and good thing we did because at 5 after 11 this place was slammed with a looooong line out the door. We ordered WAY to much food, as usual, and nothing really jumped out at us. The tortillas were hot out of the oven, and that was pretty much the highlight out of everything we ordered . The meat was all pretty flavorless, (We had the pollo, carne asada and carnitas), and you needed to load up on the salsa to get your taste buds to really react. I wish I would have tried the Chile Relleno which I hear everyone who tries it becomes instantly addicted. Oh well. 
Overall the food here is okay, and not spectacular. La Super Rica is overrated and not worth your time of standing in line or waiting for a spot to eat at the limited, and kind of depressing and gross, outdoor seating area.
If you are in the mood for some cheap and amazing Mexican food, hit up Super Cucas, and get the California Burrito with AL PASTOR or carne asada tacos. You will not be disappointed. I promise."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"So finally visited this place after years of driving by it. I grew up having AUTHENTIC GREAT mexican food. The food in this place is far, far, far, far from authentic or having any kind of flavor. I dont think anyone who has rated this place above 2 stars has had authentic mexican food. Avoid this place, go down the street to El Bajio and enjoy yourself."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It's really not all that you heard if there's a long line more than 3 deep out the door. Sure their ""EspeciAl"" is good, but waiting longer than 7 minutes to order good? Julia CHILD, please.... It gets far more attention than other Mexican restaurants in town that are just as good, or better and take cards."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"My question to you is: who in their right mind waits 45 minutes for tacos?  I don't care how good they are.  They are tacos, people. TACOS.  Certainly ""super"" cannot, just would not, mean the food here.

Seriously, I want you to reevaluate your ridiculous affinity for this place.  I think it's called ""food mecca"" syndrome.  As in, the unfortunate urge people feel to have a shared experience with a particular restaurant, often with mind-boggling disregard for quality.  Yes, ""food mecca"" afflicts La Super Rica.  The syndrome seems to particularly affect taquerias, local ice cream shops, sushi bars, and any place with homemade margaritas. 

I lived in SF for a while, and therefore I believe there's something to be said for the food itself.  45 minutes should be worth something really freakin' delicious, not just supposedly ever so slightly more ""authentic"" than the chain restaurants.  I actually like tacos that have some modicum of topping, like maybe some diced tomatoes, a bit of guac or sour cream, anything at all, really, more than just the meat haphazardly slapped on a soft tortilla.  La Super Rica, you are a taqueria, right?

I also like to eat somewhere that looks like it's cleaned on a regular basis, where flies don't hover around the kitchen.  Oh, and it's always nice to be able to order and dine in a reasonable amount of time.

Basically, I don't think I can respect someone that likes SRT, in terms of having independent thought,  in a general sense.  Sorry folks, you just don't get it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love this place, and visit from far away once/year. It's currently CLOSED tuesday AND wednesday."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Expect to stand in line for a while. Came here at 11:05ish on Sunday, and there were people waiting already. The sign still said ""Closed"". It wasn't until around 11:30 when the line finally started moving. Maybe they just opened 30 minutes late today? They never flipped the sign to ""Open"", though.

My parents and I got the first 3 tacos on the list, chicken and cheese quesadilla (#12), and the enchiladas. The highlight was the freshly made tortillas. The enchiladas was generously filled with shredded spicy chicken and had heaping scoops of guacamole. Their tacos are simply 2 pieces of tortilla with the meat. They have salsa which you get yourself that you can add to the tacos. Definitely order a few tacos, because each order only comes with one.
No burritos, just a heads up. My dad loves burritos, so he was disappointed that they don't make them. 

They also have several beers and drinks. Get a Corona or Modelo with your meal! $3 for beers; not bad. Overall, the food was good. If you're into tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, tamales, and ""smaller"" Mexican bites, check this place out. They make their own tortillas, which makes all the difference."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Beyond excellent!  This is unique eating at its best ! Yes, the line is long but it moves fast and the staff is remarkably efficient. It will be worth the  30 to 40 minutes wait. But please don't order just a taco think outside the box and venture thru the unique menu items.We tried the # 14, 16, and the tamale with chicken ...all Amazingly delicious full of flavors we had not tasted before..oh and the guacamole is super fresh! We'll be back !"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Went here on a busy Saturday for lunch. Line was long, about at 20 minute wait but it was SO WORTH IT. You must must must try the fresh tortillas and can't go wrong with any of the specials. The chile rellano was the best I've ever had. Also despite the line, there was ample seating and service was quick considering it was all made to order. Just make sure to bring cash!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Wow! This place is amazing. Totally worth the wait and the trip to the ATM beforehand. The tamal was the best I've ever had in my life and the simple cheese quesadilla allows you to savor the perfectly charred cheese and the incredible flavors of those freshly made corn tortillas. This is the only place I've ordered a watermelon juice and found a third of the cup filled with delicious fruit when I finished. It was like having dessert! Go. Eat. You'll be glad you did!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I stumbled across this gem of a place on Yelp while my hubby and I were driving through Santa Barbara last Summer. When we arrived, we noticed a line out the door that wrapped around the side of the building....and knew we had struck gold :-) It doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that fool you. 

The food is ridiculously good. Like so good that I am dreaming about our next trip in July....(cue the Homer Simpson drool sound effect.)  They have a year round menu that is on a huge board as you enter, but pay attention because they also have a small board by the order window that has weekly specials. Both visits, I have ordered off their weekly specials. If they have the chilaquiles, YOU MUST TRY. Homemade chips smothered in red sauce, topped with an onion, bell pepper, guacamole and Mexican cheese. I have also had the Veggie Tamal which is outstanding and I highly recommend. Oh, and their homemade tortillas are so good. The fresh watermelon drink is refreshing, but it does have more of an ""earthy"" flavor to it. I prefer an ice cold bottle of Coke with this meal :-)

Keep in mind that the kitchen does not use heavy salt in their dishes, which I appreciate. You can really enjoy the flavors in each bite without salt overload. 

Enjoy!! If the wait is long, be patient. It's totally worth it!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Stopped here on our way back from Solvang. Arrived at 11:45 on a Tuesday and there was still a 30 minute wait and the line got exponentially longer behind us. The line/ordering/seating process reminds me of Pinks hot dogs in LA. Long line, quick service, cheap/yummy/greasy food. I love that you get to add (or not) all of your own salsas and toppings. It saves me the trouble of having to ask for ""no onions, no cilantro"".
Tacos were super good...I love that they make the corn tortillas to order. Totally worth the wait."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Used the pictures of popular orders and comments to help with our selections, definitely glad we did! The Rajas was hands down the tastiest item we ordered and I enjoyed the super rica especial with some pico and a side of guacamole. The pork was well seasoned and tender. Everything was so fresh, would love to go back if we had more time but thankful for the chance to try this local hot spot and long time classic - so delicious!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The line was out the door but its only because the place is so small and they only have one window to take orders. The food was very good and so was the salsa. The horchata was delish! We had the #16 and it was like nothing we've had before! Highly recommend it! Expect to wait, have alot of patience!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I was referred here by a few friends who claim to be food critics.

The food was mediocre at best, the restaurant itself is nothing more than a street stall with an attached covered dinning court, and there are flies and dirty tables that aren't regularly cleaned.

The menu is 'a la carte' and the staff does not speak much English, so forget asking questions.  There is a always a wait.

It'll take more than the praise of a dead chef to convince me a place as dirty, average, and dirty (did I mention that?) is a culinary gem.

Sorry..."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The line to the restaurant is a little bit long but the food is worth it. I ordered the Chorizo especial although the dish its self is small , the taste is outstanding."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Now I understand why this place was a favorite of Julia Childs. 

Probably one of the best tacos I've ever had. Everything is made fresh and be sure to get there early as their special of the days do run out quick. I managed to check out this place twice during my two day stay in Santa Barbara.

Unfortunately, the first time I was here, I didn't know about the special and the last time I dropped by, around 8pm-ish, they had run out of the specials. Kinda sucks but oh well. All the more reason to come back when I'm in the SB area.

If you're going to come, expect to see a line during the opening hours and well into lunch. The lines seemingly get short as the day progresses. I'm sure this has something to do with their specials.

During my two trips. I tried pretty much all of their tacos, and they're all fantastic especially on their home made tortillas. 

If you're in the area, be sure to check this place out."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Not bad at all. They don't really have much but meat - cheese -tortilla based combos. I was thrown off that there was no burrito option. I tried a tri-tip bacon onion and pepper combo.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love this place! The enchiladas are amazing, and the guac is great. I love getting a range of the cheap little plates - it's almost like Mexican tapas. If you're a veg., there are only a couple options."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Not impressed, we ordered half the menu, prices were a little steep for what you get (I thought the prices were good until I saw the portions)  I prefer East LA tacos any day.  The tortillas and the horchata were good.  Was not impressed by the tamales, I know different parts of Mexico and South America make them differently, but my family is Mexican and I am not a fan of the soggy tamal.  I probably won't be back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Melted Mexican queso with bacon chunks and fresh tortillas.

Do I really need to say more?

I've been going to Super-Rica for as long as I can remember, and it is ranked as a top Taqueria by Julia Child, the LA Times, and The NY Times for a reason. The food is fresh, authentic, and dangerously delicious. It would be hard to find a better Taqueria anywhere in the United States. 

Best things on the menu:

1) Bacon and Queso Plate

2) Corn and Crema Tamales

3) Especial: Chiles, Pork, and Cheese

I love good Mexican Food, and this place is to die for. if I had to choose a last meal, this place would cross my mind for sure.

My only warning is to be prepared to wait in a line for sure. It is well worth the wait, and you will appreciate it that much more!

Thanks for reading!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Locals enjoy arguing rather or not La Super-Rica deserves its reputation or if it is just riding on Julia Child's coattails. I just know that I always enjoy their food and beverages when I come here. There's usually a line (and I hate lines), but it usually moves fast. I won't get into which Santa Barbara taqueria is the best, I'll just continue to enjoy the good food from all of them."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The mixed reviews certainly scared me in light of all the heap thats been praised on La Super Rica.  So taco places should be rated based on the quality of the taco plain and simple.  Tortilla - home made and wonderful goodness. Salsa/sauce - spicy good but nothing life changing.  Meat - bland, not juicy and certainly no better than dozens if not hundreds of places you can find all over Southern California.  We were quite disappointed.  Mind you I waited in line for 20 minutes and ordered every single taco on the menu.  Well there are only 5 so not that big of a deal.  I'm not quite sure why all of the hype.  BTW - $2.50 for a taco is not cheap.  

OK so not trying to ruin the party but the enchiladas special of the day was out of this world.  It was chicken, potatoes, mushroom covered in cheese and a white cream sauce.  I've never tasted anything like it before and would go back just for this."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We drove from Utah to come to the beach and this is the first place we always want to go! We've been coming here for about 28 years(when we lived in CA). This is the BEST Mexican food ever. We were so excited to eat, we didn't take pictures. But we will next time! We got the grilled chicken and peppers, melted cheese and guacamole! Food is pipping hot and fresh and DELICIOUS. Always consistently good. And the owners are always kind, gracious and friendly. Wish they'd move to Utah. Thank you La Super Rica!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Worth the wait in line.  Good ol' peasant food...not your typical taco/burrito joint.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Warning: I was really hungover and I waited in line for close to an hour. I'd never do that again here, but I would definitely return if I could forgo that line. 

To be honest, between two of us we ordered 6 things and they all tasted the same. All was definitely on the bland side and I needed to literally douse my food in hot sauce to get any flavor. To top it off, the meat was really dry. The fresh made tortillas are the star of the show and they know it. Pretty much everything you order is served with two. 

The pinto beans with bacon are a pass. Soupy, flavorless, this was the worst. The guac with tortillas wasn't anything special and the tacos were definitely more of the highlighted dish here, but Lillys blows them out of the water. This is a celebrated spot in SB so hit it if you can get here without waiting in line. If that's not possible I'd recommend moving on."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My second visit, my husband's first. We both LOVED! We went on Sunday of Fiesta weekend and from start to finish, was about 45 minutes. I took a few pics of the menu because I couldn't find any on-line. Also, seemed like if you didn't want the full experience you could phone in your order."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Surprised at some of the bad reviews.  They must be from people used to chain Mexican restaurants.  It's not your typical boilerplate menu so don't go if that's what Mexican food means to you.  We have eaten there often and remarked yesterday that it never disappoints.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Who can say anything bad about Super-Rica? This is a local favorite and the owners have been working this place forever. They are superstars! Food is awesome but let me give you some advice, go there before or after the rush or you will wait up to 45 minutes to get tacos. I drive by and if I see the line I just drive around and do other things for a while and come back when  it has slowed down. If you are in SB you must try this place if you want to eat what locals eat! Hey, if Katey Perry can mention it in a song, then you know it's good!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Everything here was definitely yummy!!!

The only reason I took off 1 star is for the long 1 hr wait even though only 8 people were ahead of me in line. Plus, I should add that some people were given preference or faster service when they spoke Spanish.

Stop at the ATM before heading here...CASH only!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Ok it has the Julia Child seal of approval. That my friends means it is The place to get your Mexican street food fix. 

Whether it's the Queso Fundido with Churizo or any and I mean any of the tacos at this place it is some of the best food you will find in California or anywhere. 

I can honestly say there is nothing bad on this menu. Yes you will wait in line. Yes you will swat away a few flies. Yes you will pray to the parking gods to find a spot nearby. It will all be worth it.

Heaven serves this food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,One of the best Mexican restaurants north of the boarder. Must try the Chili Relleno!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"If you take relationship advice from Taco Bell hot sauce packets...Congratulations, you have reached rock bottom -- Anonymous

I've got no relationship advice for you either except real men don't cry over women.  As my mentor Ron Swanson would say: ""Crying is only okay in two places: funerals and the Grand Canyon"".  

But I do have a La Super Rica review for you.  After traipsing through the hills above Santa Barbara, like Ron Swanson would have, I dragged my sweaty self over to this very popular and semi-famous taco joint.  I loved Lilly's Tacos when I was here in SB recently...I know Lilly's...La Super Rica, you are no Lilly's!

Prices are reasnable...two tacos, bottled water, can of soda (why with your popularity is there no soda machine?) and chips (not complementary) were all just a shade under $10.00.  I ordered the steak taco and the spicy pork.  The pork was wonderful...succulent with excellent flavor.  The handmade tortillas really are good too.

The steak was a disappointment...tender for sure...but very little flavor.  Certainly not even close to the meat Lilly's serves.

Service was nice and friendly but my chips were not given until I received my tacos.  Plus it took a good fifteen minutes until I received my tacos.  Lilly's was almost immediate.

In Santa Barbara there is no choice...Lilly's Tacos for me.  And if you can't figure that out...let's end with Ron Swanson again:

""Give a man a fish and feed him for a day. Don't teach a man to fish...and feed yourself. He's a grown man. And fishing's not that hard."""
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"If you don't know, now you know. Bring extra cash and not because it is expensive but because you are gonna want seconds. Everything is great, the speed of service is fast, so do not let the line keep you from this amazing place. 

I recommend one of everything, the salsa is great too."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My new favorite hole in the wall place to eat in Santa Barbara. Sure there other places to eat, but this places keeps it puro. I had the pozole, tamal, taco bistec, and horchata. Yum. The line was long, but most places with good food is long. The best part is that they don't make the tortilla until you place an order, so it guaranteed fresh."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Creative and tasty Mexican and Latin food, although a tad over-priced. The food was inspired and well designed."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is one of the best taco places I have been to! The food is all homemade and at a cheap price! The line was semi-long but it was worth the wait! The tortillas are homemade and the meat is freshly grilled. The guacamole is very good and the flavors of all the dishes are mind blowing! The staff is very friendly and nice, i highly recommend going here!
(I am also happy to be the 1,000th reviewer!)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"If you are hungry, this place is awesome..... the food is really affordable, and it's a very no-frills/no-pretense atmosphere. The veggie tamales are really delicious, and the horchatais also great."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The tacos were simple, but tasted great.  The kids liked the tacos since it was just meat and tortilla.  They also load up the tacos with meat.  However, I was disappointed by the horchata, since I was really hoping for a more authentic taste.  The line was out the door, but we were able to find seats.  We'll definitely stop by again next time we're in SB."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"It is okay... but I question the reviews that single this out as being a holy pilgrimage. Maybe they live in places where their only choices of Mexican fare are either Taco Bell or Tia Maria's.

After all the hype and super fans from far and wide extolling the tremendous, life changing experience of Super-Rica, I was expecting transcendence & mouth orgasm after mouth orgasm.  What we found was good quality home made food that was very traditional in a good authentic way serving everyone in at a rather untypical slow pace.  A painfully slow pace if you are hungry.

We waited 50 minutes from the time we got there on a Saturday for lunch until we had food in front of us.

Tips: Get there early.
     -Bring some reading material and sunscreen and a hat if it is hot,       because the line can wrap around the block.
   -Bring Cash
   - Avoid on weekends
 
If I were you, I'd put my money on the tamales, Alambre de Filete and some of the daily specials.  

And don't forget the horchatta.  That is some freaking good horchatta."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I don't write many Yelp reviews.  But my food was so DISGUSTING that I had to let you know about it.  First off, like everyone else we were told that La Super Rica is a must see spot in SB.  I went for the first time 5 years ago.  We were excited for some good taqueria style mexican food.  My wife and I both though it was disgusting.  No flavor and low quality food.  
So after 5 years I decided to go back for a second chance.  I kept thinking, it has to be good or why else would there always be a long line.  So we went back yesterday and my food was even worse than the first time!  Truly DISGUSTING.  No seasoning or marinade on anything. Bland and low quality.  The only thing that came to mind while attempting to eat the food was, ""this must be what dog food tastes like""... 
DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE! No Bueno..."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is packed all day and night for a reason. The food is as authentic as it gets, the staff are very friendly, you can watch them make the tortillas right there for your lunch/dinner. The bathroom is very clean and the watermelon agua fresca is amazing."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This place is the best you'll get! Worth the hour drive. It looks like a hole in the wall but the food is seriously to die for.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What a wonderful surprise!

When my wife and I were on our way to Cambria, CA, we remembered hearing about a little Mexican dive in Santa Barbara called La Super-Rica, so we decided to make a stop for lunch. We had no idea what the place looked like, but when we saw a little restaurant on the corner with a line wrapped around the building, we figured this was it... and it was! 

Quick Tip: Cash only!

The food: VERY GOOD! 

I ordered the Tacos De Costilla (grilled strips of top round served on two homemade tortillas). The price was $2.50 each. I thoroughly enjoyed the tacos!!

My wife ordered the Chilaquiles (homemade tortilla chips, covered in special sauce topped with cheese, grilled onion, bell peppers, guacamole, and Mexican cheese crumbled over the top). This was excellent!

Since we live to so far away, we can't become regulars (sigh), but I guarantee that this will be a MUST go-to-place whenever we are in the area or even passing through. 

Looking forward to trying other wonderful dishes!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Quick trip to Santa Barbara for my bro-in-law's wedding.  First chance I got, jumped in an Uber and came straight here.  Julia Child called this her favorite taco shop during a Good Morning America interview years ago.  It is now mine as well."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is a taco stand. You are expected to sauce your own meal, folks. Just like in Mexico! Yyyyyyyeah.  This is not fine dining. It's cheap, good food. If you want to whine that someone didn't put sauce on your meal, or that it isn't kid friendly or -- horrors! -- you had to wait in line, I'm not very sympathetic. If these are your issues, may I suggest Taco Bell. 

Very, very tasty food. My favorite Mexican in U.S. I go here every time I am within 400 miles."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This was my first time eating at La Super-Rica and maybe my last.  I decided the cause for all the hype must be the meat or something, because the vegetarian options really weren't all that great.

I had Tamal de Verdura (?) which was a vegetable tamale.  It was a little over $3, which isn't bad for world famous mexican food, but still - not worth the price.  The tamale was filled with chayote, corn, squash, and a couple other things, but wasn't FILLED, you know?  The thing overall was pretty thin.  Smothered in a milky sauce which I wasn't all that fond of.  The taste was alright though, just nothing remarkable.

My girlfriend got the Queso de Cazuela for around $3 as well.  She loves cheese, but this wasn't what we were expecting in the slightest.  Our food came and it was literally just a big melted blob of cheese in a pinkish tomato juice broth.  Comes with 3 tortillas (each one about the circumference of an orange), so she just kind of scooped the cheese onto the tortillas and ate it that way.  Not sure exactly how we were supposed to tackle this one.  

I was still hungry so I got a quesadilla for a little under $2.  The handmade tortillas themselves were really good (albeit tiny) and the melted cheese was so-so.  Not spicy or anything, just kind of like melted white cheese.

Overall, I guess the food matches the clientele.  While the exterior may look like your average tasty taqueria, the average customer was well over 60 years old.  Can't exactly inject too much flavor into stuff they could serve at the Senior Citizen's Center.  I'm not saying this place is awful by any means, but there's farrrrrrrr better taquerias out there and they all have shorter lines."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Heard all the rave about this place and finally decided to give it a try. Pork tacos, beans, cheese quesadilla and guacamole were good. The home-made corn tortillas were off the hook. We did not care for the Chile rellano. They also did not include our chips (from the guacamole and chips that we paid for). Had order to go, so didn't realize they were missing til we were home."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"La Super Rica es muy rica! I live in San Francisco and crave the rajas! don't expect pretty food, it is simple and delicious!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Loved the place. Waited in line for 45 minutes yesterday. Totally worth the wait. Tried the #16 pork. Very tender and flavorful. Tamales were excellent. Liked it so much that went back today for more. Another 40 minute line to get the Chile Relleno. Oh my! Delicious. Wish I could come here more. Lovely owner and lovely food. Don't expect anything upscale. It is a hole in the wall kind of place. But the food is unbeatable.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"As a native of Orange County I had the privilege of eating amazing Mexican food served with handmade tortillas, which makes a huge difference and is why this place is so special. Get the special, some guacamole and get ready to be happy. The line is daunting, but goes quickly most times so be patient and know there is a rainbow at the end of the wait."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"It may be a hole in the wall, but the food is great!  Love, love, love the guacamole.  It is great that they make their own tortillas.  That is all I tried so far.  Next time I am down there I will have to try it again."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"If you can handle the long wait, this is definitely an excellent Mexican joint. Skip the tacos, as they aren't as spectacular as the other food. Besides the tacos, everything else we got was incredibly delicious. Particularly jaw-dropping was the chorizo especial. Don't be expecting a lot of typical American-Mexican food staples such as included sides or chips and salsa, as you won't be getting any of that. The seating also definitely leaves something to be desired."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is pretty dope. 

They have bunch of little things so it's easy to accidentally over order.  I'm pretty sure I tried every non-meat option on the menu. ALL DELICIOUS.  Also the best Horchata I've tasted in ages.   

Rajas & chili con queso for the win!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Good food for great prices. Had the Super Rica Especial - was pretty tasty, but no way good enough to make me want to wait through the agonizing lines again.  The main reason they have long lines is not because of the food and prices, it's that they are not well organized. The organization of the ordering line is outrageously bad. They could easily speed things up at this place, by observing, say, the way a place like in-and-out flows their customers through. I'll probably never come back here because I don't wait 45+ minutes in line for any food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"La Super Rica is a famous Mexican place in Santa Barbara raved by Julia Child and Katy Perry. 

Lines can be extremely long, usually out the door (although only about three people can fit between the door and cashier anyways). We went on a Monday and we only had to wait behind 2-3 people. Location is slightly far away from downtown state street, about a 3-5 minute drive.

FYI MAJOR PART: they don't take cards. You have to pay in cash. We didn't learn this until we got there, but luckily we had enough cash on us to cover it!

We got #1,#3,#4,#5,#7, and #12. #1 was really good, but not the best steak taco I've ever had. The chorizo taco was actually the best one as the meat was extremely flavorful and cooked quite well! Both #3 and #4 were similar in taste although one of the meats was drier than the other. #12 the cheese quesadilla with chicken was quite basic and I wouldn't get it again because you can do it at home and add more inside the quesadilla. The #7 tritip was really good although it needs more than 3 tacos in my opinion, more like 6 (but we asked for 3 more before cause we didn't realize the tacos were underneath the meat. All that food for about $25!

Now I'm a Lilly's girl. I love their tacos, they're cheaper than La Super Rica and their meats are SOOOO much tastier! I will say La Super Rica wins on salsa for sure, Lilly's doesn't even compare in the salsa department. We even took some home. So I'd say go get Lilly's tacos, but eat them with La Super Rica's salsa! 

There's a good amount of seating behind the kitchen area. They don't have a permanent roof and we went on a windy day and I could see it shaking, so maybe don't come on a rainy day.

Overall: 3.5 stars. Food is good, but doesn't reach height that the fame has given it. Location isn't optimum and interior is underwhelming. Go to Lilly's instead"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We lucked out having come here on the weekend with a small line.  Food looks more Americanized... I'm biased since I'm use to cabeza and lengua.  Now that I've tasted the food, it is very Americanized.  Flavors were very distinct,.nothing complex.  For the price, it's not that bad.  For the wait, totally not worth it, especially if you live in LA or OC or anywhere with an authentic Mexican community.  Horchata was too sweet, their special was a plate of charred bell peppers and cheese with pork.  I must admit that the quality of meat was good.  But the flavors were lacking.  The tamale pescado had no seasoning, no salt.  It was a big disappointment."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Still amazing!  I avoid the week-ends, never have a long wait.  I get a favorite and then something new, add the fresh salsas, and I am in heaven!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great ""cheap eats"" place with lots of locals.  We got the grilled chicken plate, side of guacomole with two corn tortillas, a vegetable tamale, and a horchata.  I was surprised that one of my SF bay area friends had reviewed this already!  The food was very fresh and delicious.  The gauc was bland, and quite frankly, mine is better but I was hungry so I poured salsa over the guac and made do!  The place is in the middle of no where on Milpas, and there really is just a tarp over the eating area.  Interior is very stark, and more like a canteen type feel. I wish they offered chips. They also have a very limited salsa bar with only 3 types of salsas.  Overall, glad to have checked this out and had a good time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The cashier is super friendly but coming from LA I guess I have high expectations.

 I wouldn't be back for these tacos. 

-Ordered Tri tip and steak tacos - too dry and over cooked! Not very much flavor either. No onions or cilantro :/ yes  the give you a lot of meat but it sucks so yeah. 
-Ordered the ROJAS taco- cheese and Chile- NOT AT ALL SPICY! 
-hand made tortillas are good but I wouldn't return just for the tortillas 
-2 types of sauces - NONE WERE SPICY AT THE VERY LEAST- the green one actually tasted like Dawn Soap!
-no lemons or radishes to go with the tacos 
-and a LARGE drink is actually a small. The Horchata was good though(see picture)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"If you are looking for a pricy place to spend on basic tacos go here. The quesadillas are way overpriced for the size they serve it on. Compared to other taqueria places I'd rather spend that $2.50 dollars for a taco in Los Angeles, at least there the tacos would taste good. And $2.50 for a large horchata was not worth it. Their definition of large is a cup size. Worst place to eat tacos smh. Definitely not worth it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is pretty good - if you have time, or if there's no line, you should check it out.

Get ready to wait in line. Is it worth it? Well, here's the breakdown:

Amazing tortillas - they really make the place. They get 5 stars.

Taco's themselves would probably get 3 stars (average). I just wasn't expecting to get a taco that included JUST the meat in it. (you can add the salsas). The meat was good (for a taco joint), but not that good to get 4 stars on its own.

Jjamaica was too sweet. (not bad, but too sweet to finish)

--
So, if you're with a group of friends, go ahead wait in line and have fun.  It's a good place to check off your list. However I will not be waiting in line by myself."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Unassuming from the outside but awesome food, fresh homemade tortillas, great authentic flavor."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place has the most authentic Mexican food you'll find in SB. Super FLAMAS. Would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys Mexican cuisine. Had the tacos de adabado with the quesadilla con chorizo and they were dank. The salsa variety is slightly lacking but the salsa they've got is A1 Steaksauce. Wish I could get the recipe. The tortillas are as fresh as possible and you can taste it. The recipes are very basic but sometimes simple is better and this is one of those times. Leaving this place, I felt a great deal of satisfaction and I'm sure you will too. 
P.S. My Mexican friend agrees"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place definitely lived up to its hype.  We ordered the #7 and #14 - tri tip, peppers, mushrooms, bacon and cheese/chorizo dishes - each with 3 homemade tortillas.  Super cheap, tasty, and authentic!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"STOP!  Before you come, they do not take plastic!  Cash only!  And it takes FOREVER!

So this is the place that Julia Child raved about huh?  Well let's see!

We've been waiting outside for close to 15 minutes now and the line is barely moving!

Almost all tacos! They do have a Chilaquiles and a choke rellano.  The tortillas are hand made to order so I'm guessing that they are bomb.  Ordered a variety of tacos for me and the kids. A couple steak, a couple pollo, and a pork.  We'll see in a few.

One thing is for sure; one must be patient to eat here!  I hope that it meets the hype?!?  40 minutes so far and still waiting!

Honestly the food was good!!  I don't know about great, or worth the wait and the inconvenience of not taking plastic.

The horchata is off the hook though!  It has to be from scratch!

Three stars for the wait and cash only policy.  Otherwise it would have been four."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Such a genuine family restaurant- true Santa Barbara staple! The Pachuga Suizas are to die for.

La super-rica is definitely the best tacos in Santa Barbara. 
La super-rica now has my heart."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Love this place! You can watch them make the tortillas as you order your food. So good!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My husbands friend recommended this place.  We were there for a summer basketball tournament.  I think we ate here for about 3 out of our 5 meals. The lines are long but not too bad.  The parking is not good since you have to park in the neighborhood.  
If it is busy then it is bad parking.  Ronald Reagan favorite place I heard."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My wife and I took my parents here because of the history with Julia Child and we were kind of pleasantly surprised by how good the food was.  There's nothing fancy about the place and we had to wait about 15 minutes just to order.  While you're waiting you can watch the food being prepared in the kitchen and more interestingly, the tortilla lady hard at work making fresh tortillas.  She makes them all by hand a cooks them anywhere on the grill she can find room.  They are some of the best tortillas you'll find anywhere.

There are plenty of choices on the menu once your inside and we tried a pretty wide assortment.  Once we placed our order we tried to find a place in the dining area.  Initially everything was full, but after about 5-10 minutes something opened up.  We waited another 5-10 minutes for our number to be called at the window.

Everything was very good.  Probably my favorite was the Chile Relleno with salsa crema, which was a special that day.  A good addition to everything was the fresh made salsas they have in the dining room near the pickup window.

I was surprised how inexpensive everything was given the places notoriety.  If you're in the area it's definitely worth stopping and worth the wait.  If I'm back in the area I'd gladly go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great Santa Barbara find. Tiny little spot that quickly moves people in and out. Had to wait in line but as the line wraps inside you see the small kitchen at work - with a woman making fresh tortillas right on the hot stovetop. The tacos are cheap, simple and delicious. Enjoyed the chicken and the guacamole tacos. The generous portion of guacamole came with two fresh tortillas. The chicken tacos were like a tortilla sandwich with melted cheese and chicken in the middle of two crisp tortillas. Only complaint is that there are no chips to go with the salsas and guac. Cash Only."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great Pozole good flavor and generous serving. Also had a pork quesadilla with guacamole.  Came here on a Sunday morning right after they opened and the line was long. Staff friendly, pace clean and well kept.  Will be back again!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"After read yelp review and found out this is Julia Child favorite place I said to myself I have to try this.  I get there around 5.00pm on Thursday and there was online. There were about 5 customers. I order the famous #16, # 4, 1 dish from special menu and watermelon drink.  

The fresh tortillas were good. But over all  taco were just okay nothing outstanding.  I was a little bit disappointed.  My favorite was watermelon drink which was so refreshing."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Always a favorite and as good as ever.
Freshly prepared and delicious.
No frills, just great food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"On a Friday at 1:15 p.m., we waited in line 1 hour, then another 15 mins. for the food to arrive.  I got a steak taco and a pork taco.  They came completely unadorned: just the tortilla and the meat.  I added salsa from the salsa bar.  Was it good? Yes.  Was it worth the wait? No.  I've had better in San Francisco's Mission area, including the homemade tortillas."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"So good!  Don't even think about it just go.  The rajas, the pork tacos, the fresh guacamole, the rice, and holy crap the pico de gallo.  A must when passing by Santa Barbara!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Cheap, fresh, delicious tacos! They keep the place really nice and clean with plenty of places to sit. Mexican food as real as it gets. I didn't wait long (maybe cause I was lucky) and the food was life changing. Everything about this place shattered my standards and expectations. I'm definitely coming back for some more whenever I get the chance to go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Best Mexican food in California. 100% worth waiting in a long line. The ambiance is bery authentic to the food. Right behind the cashier you can see a woman handmaking the tortillas fresh to be eaten. The food had such a unique array of flavors. You can't go wrong- everything is amazing. Price is also extremely reasonable. I recommend ordering several different dishes and sharing family style because you will want to try everything. also... horchata!!!!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. 

Worth the wait. 

Very casual and friendly atmosphere. 

As a vegetarian I was able to eat a yummy cheese gordita and some guacamole tacos. Basics, but still awesome."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Recently visited this run-down taco shop for the first time, and it's a gift from god. It's not your usual California taqueria fare, but more along the lines of what you'd expect to find in Mexico's interior. I had the lomito suizo which was chunks of incredibly flavorful marinated pork stuffed into a small quesadilla on corn tortillas that the lady makes right in front of you. The adobada tacos were fantastic as well. High-quality hot sauce. All but a few items are priced at roughly $3 or so, and I imagine that 2 or 3 items would be a solid enough meal for most folks. Do it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Yo quiero La Super-Rica Taqueria!

That 40% beef crap from Taco Bell or other fake taco shops simply can't compare with the superiority of the fresh food served here. The tortillas are to die for, homemade & soft without being soggy when meat is piled high on top. And the meat really is piled, they don't skimp here! Everything I've ever had here is freakin' good. Everything is under $5, a taco + quesadilla usually fills me up, but of course I could eat more. I always make it a point to stop here when I'm in SB!

Caution: The place can get pretty packed & they're CASH ONLY!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I don't get it, i really don't. The food was very bland, overpriced and small portions. 

The guy at counter ""warned"" me about the Gordita being really spicy, i'm pretty terrible when it comes to handling spicy food so i was prepared to struggle with it. 1 bite, nothing, 2 bite, nothing, 3rd bite, nothing spicy was being tasted. I've been to so many other places where they tell me an item isn't spicy, yet was spicier. The Carne asada tacos tasted like they got the meat and just threw it on the grill, no seasoning, no, soaking it, nothing. The posole was about the only decent tasting thing here. 

I want it to be clear that i'm voicing my opinion on the food taste. The service was decent, the quality of the food was good, but the taste was lacking across the whole menu to me. Especially for the price and portion sizes. But i may be a minority in my opinion considering there was a half hour line i stood in and it only seemed to grow. Maybe its because im from SoCal so im used to more authentic stuff. All i know is that Katy Perry and Westways magazine have very lows standards on what they call ""Good Mexican food"""
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Just returned from a four day trip to Santa Barbara. Ate here twice on this stay. Let's just say I'll be dreaming about La Super-Rica for a few months. Boy do I wish we had a place like this on the east coast! 

All specials I tried were fantastic. Each something ""different"" from the typical Mexican as described by the person taking orders. The especiale (I believe #16) was excellent. Guacamole super fresh. Taco's and tortilla's perfectly cooked and seasoned. They ran out of the spicy bean filling for the gordita, so he offered to fill it with cheese. Was unbelievable. If they have chilaquiles on the special menu - GET IT!! Trust me - my favorite dish. 

And to wash it down - the horchata was the best I have ever had. Lots of cinnamon - tasted like liquid rice pudding. Don't miss out on this special drink - I've never had it this good anywhere east of the Mississippi - including Texas."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"5 star for taste. Unlimited Fresh kitchen made salsa 

The tortillas are made fresh on the spot. I dont think I ever seen it like that and I am from Los Angeles You see a girl pressing and throwing them right onto the grill. 

I think it's the best tasting tacos I ever had and being in Los Angeles area for 25+ years, it's tough to beat.  The aftermath of the delicious meal didnt left me feeling queasy and bloated or gasy. It digested well. 2 days prior, I had a wet burrito in Los Angeles and I felt I was growing a double chin afterwards. I felt so greasy and kept burping.


I have to count on yelp reviewers to give me photo of the actual food item.  I wish they have photos or something. Or at least something to look at while waiting in line

Specialty items like tameles and enchiladas do not have a price so better ask before you order. Pretty sure it is wasnt 2 dollars.   My fault for not asking so for a meal enough for 4 people I spent 50 dollars.  I didnt want to hold up the huge long line behind me. Hochata was ok, hibiscus was ok.  


If you are there first time and on a trip to Santa Barbara, order one of each. Don't forget to try Tameles an enchiladas.  Actually enchiladas were ok.


The zucchini and pork was the best I think. Quesadilla was ok. 

There was only 1 cashier and I think that's how they operate so that's probably the main reason for the long line. 

It is a must eat.   It is like in&out of Mexican food.

1 star down for long wait, no photo menu, no price on tameles and enchiladas.

Btw I didnt get a receipt so I was nervous if they left out something. Maybe I should of asked.

I am convinced what makes it taste good is fresh made tortillas. It makes a whole lot difference"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Omg this place is flavor town! I love their tacos and tortillas are made by hand, which is the best part in my opinion. They have tacos de rajas which are my fave!! They also have the best guacamole ever! Seriously if you're in SB this place is a must! But you need to be patient because this place always has a line because they are that delicious."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Loooong wait but actually worth it, wanted to give it a 4, but seeing the great service from employees despite the crowd made it 5. I asked for side of raw onion and they literally chopped up fresh onion for us.
It definitely takes more than one visit to get your order right. The tacos are good but you need other dishes to complement that especially delicious cheesy quesadillas. This was our order:

12
16
18

10
1
2

And the special beef taco."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"It is a classic. I always enjoy a visit to LSR. Be mindful it is cash only, but for the amount of traffic that goes through on a daily basis, food is served promptly."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Went with my mom, sister, grandma and baby niece. The line was not very long at all. And the food was fantastic! I got #16, sister got a tamle, mother got enchiladas, and grandma got a chicken Quesadilla. All of it was so great! I'd definitely come back again."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I have heard a lot of good things about this place.  This place was also featured on travel channels Man vs Food. My hopes and expectations were high for this place, maybe the highest expectations I ever had for a restaurant. I tried a few items the #16  which was featured on tv, a spicy bean gordita, a chicken quesadilla thing. All my items were...good. That saying I was expecting great. They love to put a lot of cheese on their dishes...who doesn't like melted cheese? It tasted fresh as it was made to order but it was lacking flavor. Bottom line is would I return to this establishment...yes. But I wont go out of my way for it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Simply the best. Everyone knows it. Family owned and operates forever in the east Milpas neighborhood. #3 tacos carnitas and #10 chorizo quesadilla plus a horchata. Get there early
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A-FREAKING-MAXING. First time in Santa Barbara and first spot I hit to eat. Line was out the door and let me tell you all, 100% worth the wait. Tortillas made fresh, steak cooked to absolute perfection. The number 16, oh my gosh, I can't even. Everything here so so delicious and the staff was so kind a friendly. Highly recommend!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"At 1:45pm on Friday, the line was quite long.  The wait was over 30 minutes long but I guess that was not too bad considering the popularity of this place.  

For such a small Mexican restaurant, the menu is quite extensive.  Good thing I already knew what I wanted based on the yelp reviews I've read.  I decided to get Tacos de Adobado and Tamal de Verduras.  BF chose Tacos de Bistec and Tacos de Chuleta.  As we were waiting to place our order, we saw one of their cook pressing/shaping tortillas and grilling them.  I don't think I've ever had fresh handmade tortillas in restaurants (in California) before.  

We waited about 15-20 minutes for our food.  Including the waiting time, it took a little over an hour before we actually got our food.  That said if you're super hungry and want food immediately, this restaurant is not for you.

Now the food.  The tortilla was very good.  I mean, really good.  The texture was delightfully soft and chewy - like a delicate steamed bun.  I didn't know tortillas could have that kind of texture.  Compared to the wonderful tortilla, the meat filling was somewhat disappointing.  I liked how the meat pieces were chunkier than typical tacos but the flavor was just average.  Salsa was decent.  I liked the tomatillo based salsa which had mild and citrus flavor.  If not for the tortilla, their tacos are average at best.  Tamal de Verduras on the other hand was a different story.  I usually don't like fresh tamales (because of the smell) and I don't really like vegetables very much but I really enjoyed their vegetable tamales.  Usually, fresh tamales have strong corn smell that I'm not fond of but their tamales had very mild and delicately sweet aroma of corn.  Some may find the dish a bit too sweet because of the cream sauce but the flavor was just right for me.  I would definitely come back and wait in line for this dish."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"To be fair, I don't eat here. My guys LOVE this place, but the line is usually so long that I just don't wan to wait. But my staff loves this place, my family loves this place and the super long line says others do to."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,fresh tortillas brings this nice little Mexican place to the next level.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I've been going here for a few years and just took my nephew and his girlfriend last Friday for their first time and it is still absolutely incredible. I think they may have increased the portion size, not sure because I was so excited about turning them on to it that I over-ordered but we did our best to devour it all. The tortillas are just like cake and they've been making them the same way for years. I always order the Especial and then one or two of the specials which never disappoint. Yes, I will drive the hour and half to eat there on a Saturday afternoon, it is worth it! The main thing to remember is that a) you will stand in line and b) the food takes a little longer to make so don't be in a rush-- plus, you want to enjoy your meal. This is NOT fast food! It is GREAT food made by people who care about continuing to make great food!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"#15 tocino especial SLAYS me.

do you like cheese?  do you like bacon? imagine both melted together in a bowl with three fresh tortillas... now I'm hungry.

be sure you have cash."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We didn't know how delicious authentic Mexican food was until we had this. Ordered the special tamal (great mole!), poblano relleno, beef tacos, chorizo taco, chicken taco, and guacamole taco. Homemade salsas on the side. So fresh. So delicious. Went there at 7:30 pm on Sunday night and the place was still pretty busy."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"i've only been to place twice and maybe i'm not getting the right things, but everything that i've tried has only been mediocre to me. the food expectations did not live up to everyones reviews on this place...but perhaps i need to give it another try."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This is a unique experience and one that I would recommend to anyone visiting Santa Barbara. We went twice and had enough items that we felt like we got a good taste of everything. 

Having said all of that, I have to admit Super Rica does not live up to the hype. The food was good but not worth standing in line for 30 minutes. I'm sorry about this because I really wanted it to be out of this world but it simply wasn't. 

My wife had the chile and onions taco and she thought it was the nuts. Other than that, this place is, unfortunately, just okay."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Look forward to eating here every time I am in Santa Barbara.  Always a treat. I like everything on the menu. The homemade tortillas are amazing and the tamal de verduras is fantastic.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is a great place! Everybody knows that Milpas can be an ""unsafe"" neighborhood, and there aren't many places I as a white person feel safe in this neck of the woods. Then there's Super-Rica! You can bring a family here, sit on the patio where you can keep your car in sight, no overly ""interesting"" or ""authentic"" weird flavors to turn off your typical child... We go here all the time. Keep up the good work!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I'm Mexican and I'll give it the seal of approval for Santa Barbara. However, if you like spicy salsa, bring your own. Homemade corn tortillas and food cooked to order. Come by and check this place out. Bring your money cause it's cash only!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Came to this place to eat because somebody recommended it to me.. well the wait for our food took forever and it was on a weekday so i don't understand.. Once i got my tacos, there was no limes or cilantro or onions so I had no choice but to just add salsa... my tacos were so dry, the meat was horrible the only good part was the hand made tortillas
Don't plan on ever going back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,A Santa Barbara tradition! I had tacos and some the best homemade pick de gallo ever!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Best Mexican food in So Cal hands down.  The line is long (extremely long). But the best things in life are well worth the wait.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Another over hyped restaurant just because of the Yelp reviews.  It was not bad, but definitely nothing that deserves a 20 min wait in line to order.  Yes, they have delicious homemade tortillas, but thats where it ends.

There really is nothing really exciting going on, and the ""large"" horchata is basically a regular water cup. I was also yearning for a burrito, but this is a tacos only place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Another great lunch at La Super-Rica! We have been here several times for lunch. In fact, we now stop any time we pass through on the way from LA to Paso. The enchiladas are terrific and all the tortillas are made to order.

On our most recent visit we had the enchilada special which was prepared with homemade red sauce, shredded chicken, cheese and topped with homemade guacamole. A side of guacamole and of beans completed the meal.

We miss California Mexican food a lot, so this spot is not to be missed!

Don't be discouraged by the line. It's worth the wait :-)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"it's different than the usual choices i see for ""taqueria"" street food places. it's a must try to see different choices. the staff is a well oiled machine and it's fun to see them go soooo fast. Food comes out within 10-15 min. I think I'm a fan for the specials menu: enchilada and tamale.

we stood in line about a 20 min for a Saturday night dinner. 

this street stand has tables and chairs, with windows to keep the wind out."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I had one more meal to enjoy on the road in my journey down the California coast. I had to enjoy it here. 
I ordered two tacos and their version of a pork quesadilla, with a large horchata. It came out to just over $11, and it was way too filling. Next time, I'd just stick with two items. The tacos could have been split up into four tiny ones. 

The tortillas, salsas, and pico de gallo were great! The meat was a tad on the dry side, but still tasted good. 

This is one of those places I'd want to plan a day trip up to Santa Barbara just to try again."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The fresh made tortillas are great but aside from that nothing special. I would definitely recommend the quesadilla over the tacos. The tacos don't have much flavor. But I did enjoy the chorizo quesadilla. But just an FYI, it's super small."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is a definitely a place you will enjoy!  
Fresh tortillas being made fresh to order!  A causal friendly place.  

So many good options:
* chorizo especial was amazing.  I watched them cook this delicious treat.  Grilled chorizo chopped and smothered with a cup of hot bubbly cheese.  Amazing!!! 
* the chicken sopes were also a star.  Perfect sopes, Tender inside slightly crisp underside.  Served with a garlic tomato sauce which I wish I had put on everything else.  
*  Cheese Rellenos were  one of groups favorites.  Mild chili with light fluffy batter smothered in a unique and delicious crema sauce.  
*  Super Rica Especial was delicious the meat was slightly too dry for my liking."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Wow what a nostalgia trip walking back in here. It's a very small place in a not-so-great part of Santa Barbara, but they sure are serving up some excellent Mexican food.

The menu is written big above the counter where you order, and they always have daily specials in addition to their staples.  Through the glass window, you can see the tiny and frantic kitchen, as well as a woman in the middle making fresh tortillas!

Most items here are small-plates style and range from ~$2-$7.50.  You order and sit in the back where plastic chairs and tables cover an empty dining room with a plastic overhang above.  It's dirty, it's real and I like it.  There is also a little salsa bar where you get your food that has pico de gallo and a few other spicier salsas.

The food is always delicious and any time you're passing through Santa Barbara, please PLEASE stop at La Super-Rica.  You won't regret it.

DISCLAIMER: Lines can be unfathomably long, so plan accordingly!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I came here based on a recommendation.  My friend loves this place.

I thought the food I got was fine, but it wasn't out of the ordinary: marinated pork tacos and guacamole. But I liked the atmosphere, so I will come back and try more dishes and possibly improve the rating.

The big issue is the line out the door. Waiting to order plus getting my order took 20-30 minutes. I had only ordered two dishes, which I found out later weren't a lot of food, so... I left hungry, because I didn't want to wait another 20-30 minutes."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I think these tacos are magical. 

No, not like the magical fruit.  These tacos actually make people nicer.  Case in point: When you are wandering around helplessly,  arms loaded full of tacos with nowhere to sit-- you will find someone to make room at their table and share their personal space with you.  Also, I can make these tacos disappear faster than you can say ""chile relleno de queso con crema"".  Freshly made tortillas always make me happy, and so does a nice cup of horchata.  

Nice & happy.  What more can you ask for?  (Well, besides a freakin' place to sit?)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is the 2nd time we've been here. I think I could eat here everyday if I lived anywhere within the county limits. Everything we had last time was delicious. 

The frijol ___ (blah blah - I can't remember the rest of what it was called) was sold out so its prolly awesome. I will have to try that next time. 

The speak English and are friendly!!! What more could u want in an authentic taco joint? 

....and I'm not racist, I just barely passed Spanish class.

CASH ONLY"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I read great reviews, so we decided to eat here.  After an hour long wait just to order, I can say that the food wasn't worth it. The asada and al pastor meat for the tacos had no flavor. This is not an authentic latin restaurant.  Others without an experienced pallet may think otherwise."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What a wonderful place! The food (especially the tortillas) tastes so fresh. The spices don't overwhelm the meat and the atmosphere is perfectly without any pretense. My wife, a native Southern Californian, has raved about this place being her favorite childhood eatery. Before Julia Child and Mario Batali raved about this place, my wife Sara was already gobbling up their tacos.

Sara now writes a wonderful food blog and he latest discusses our trip to Super Rica. Check it out:

6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Love the home made tortillas!  Food is authentic, delicious and reasonably priced.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants good Mexican food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"SMALL SMALL SMALL PORTIONS. Sopas were okay, chorizo and cheese quesadilla was mediocre and a little greasier than I would have liked. Not worth the hype--try lilly's instead."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Definitely not worth the wait for the tacos or the gorditas. The horchata and guacamole was the only good thing I had. Lastly, they have no fish tacos.....it's a coastal town. Geez! Major disappointment.

The wait is toooo long."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Always to freshest down-home Mexican food to be had!   Line up by 10:45 am.  Covered patio seating.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"A getaway weekend to SB wouldn't be complete without stopping and doing a little Los Agaves vs La Super Rica comparison.  Having lived in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Orange County all our lives, we definitely can appreciate good Mexican food.

We liked the family style, old-school ambiance of La Super Rica but was slightly irked as it took FOREVER to get our food once we ordered, and they got our order wrong TWICE.  We noticed the people before us and after us also had their orders wrong so maybe they were asleep behind the wheel that night.

The home made tortillas were good but a little thick in my opinion.  The pico de gallo was super fresh and definitely enhanced the meal.  The guacamole was good but not life changing.  My husband ordered the #16 and a chorizo taco...and received a #16 and a pork taco.  He liked his meal though. I got the veggie tamale (which I LOVED) and a quesadilla, which they had to be reminded about.

All in all, I'm glad we went, but if I had to choose one it would be Los Agaves (I understand that both are totally different animals though)."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Delicious! Suggested by friends at UCSB as the best Mexican place around - as echoed in the 200+ other reviews here - La Super-Rica is an awesome, unassuming little place that dishes up amazing food.

Moist, fresh tortillas are made on the spot, forming the base for delicious tacos and quesadillas as well as being served alongside soups or just about anything else on the menu.

Overhyped? Maybe -- lines were out the door in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, but the food was standout delicious enough that I would wait again in a heartbeat."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"La Superica is THE BEST Mexican restaurant in the world! I have been coming here for my entire life (31years), travelled all over looking for good Mexican food, but nothing compares to my Superica! Number 13 is my favorite dish! Love Isador and Martine and the entire gang!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"What luck! Purchased 15 tacos and we received the 15 tacos with meat that had no seasoning!!! Perhaps we went on a bad day when the cook must of been mad at the boss and decided not to even put a little salt on the meat?. Who knows what happened, all that i can say is this meat was just cooked plain. Perhaps it ok if you like food with no flavor or some type of zero sodium diet? Or perhaps we should say we want the meat marinated with lil onion, lemon, salt, cilantro and pepper while its cooking. And as for the maseca tortillas they ok! i would have preferred thy real hand made tortillas you know the kind that the masa comes from ""el molino"""
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We read the raves on Yelp and made a special trip to try it out, but were disappointed. Lack of flavor and limp greasy tortillas were what we got. We ordered the Beef tacos special of the day -not bad but a little chewy. Super Rica especially and guacamole were flavorless. We ate at Lily's yesterday and LOVED IT! We recommend that you go there when up in Santa Barbara and looking for good tacos! We finally gave up on this meal and returned to Lily's and it was GREAT!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"4 words: Tortillas made to order.

I have only been here once, so that should be acknowledged. But this place is probably one of the best restaurants I have ever been to for the value. The food is good, service fast and people are nice. There isn't much else to say. 

Fast, tasty, authentic and unique. It is certainly not a classically romantic place or anything like  that, but it is clean and has its own charm.

Highly recommend."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is always busy. Their plates are easy to share and come with 3 tortillas. It's vegetarian friendly and also for meat lovers. Their horchata is sweet and not grainy at the bottom. 

My friends and I like ordering several of their small plates and sharing them. Our favorites are the steak tacos, rajas with queso and chorizo and cheese dish. Don't come expecting silverware. You can expect some great fresh tortillas though!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Is it worth a drive to Santa Barbara?  YES.  Is it worth a wait in line for 30 minutes and then another 30 minutes for food?  YES, unless you are starving.  The people in line are friendly and you end up making new friends.  I'm not sure why the kitchen is ALWAYS so slow, even when the line is short.  But the food is wonderful.  My favorite is the over the top bowl of cheese and bacon with fresh tortillas.  ( I know, it's unhealthy but once in a while...)  I think its the tocino especial, #15.  
I have been coming here for many years and actually saw Julia Child here once with a group of young, rowdy chefs.  It was great to hear that voice sitting beside us!
Enjoy.
And remember no credit cards.  I have seen many a person stand in the long line, only to discover this when they start to order."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We tried the beef tacos and the beef fajita. Both were very bland and dry, even the guacamole was tasteless. My kids,who don't like too much spices on food , said the food was missing the basic salt and pepper. I don't think we will recommend it to any one."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Hands down best Mexican food in Santa Barbara.. The chorizo tacos are unreal!! So worth waiting in line. If you really enjoy good Mexican food w great attitudes. I recommend this place. Nevermind the atmosphere. The food is worth it..
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Very good for the price, be aware that the portions are small (they make sense due to the price) and if you are hungry order 3 tacos or so because the last thing you want to do is stand in line for another 30 minutes b/c you're still hungry.  No chips, order the guacamole and you will get 2 tortillas, I ordered the chicken and cheese it was sort of like a quesadilla/papusa/taco and was good (big chunks of chicken, not bite-size) and the pork tamale (not on the menu) and it was pretty good.  This place pretty much is a pork and beef place, which is what I'll order next time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Nice hole in the wall Mexican joint. Apparently Ms. Childs columbused it. 
I would recommend taco de hongo, tamales especial, and sopes."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Excellent food and vegetarian choices were incredible. Served piping hot and fresh. The condiment bar was great. Watermelon juice was amazing with loads of chunks of watermelon. Ordered a variety of entrees and all were fantastic.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Went here with a friend for lunch after driving up to SB from LA.

We got #11, #15, #16, and #17.

Overall, the food was decent but nothing that blew my mind. I do have to say that the home made tortillas were pretty tasty, as was the #16, but everything else was comparable to other quality Mexican places I have been to in California.

One of the biggest shortcomings for this place is definitely the lack of seating available and the salsas they offer. They really don't have much flavor in my opinion and just had a touch of heat.

Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area, and best to go during non-peak times/weekdays."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What can be said that hasn't already been said? Casual spot with long lines unless you come early. So affordable, very flavorful meat, and amazingly doughy tacos. Cash only!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is great!  A taco stand turned favorite of Santa Barbara residents and tourists alike, La Super-Rica has been featured in Sunset Magazine and I've been told Julia Child said it was one of her favorite Mexican restaurants.

Be aware that there is a very long wait most days, and the line can go down the block.  Get there early."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This place is legendary! The food is authentic. Be advised; it's cash only. I know that presidents have a eating here in the past. This doesn't surprise meeither. Such good food!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Fresh handmade tacos with enough meat for two tacos.... salsa bar was less than average
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We are usually in town for the weekend once a year for a golf tourney and we finally waited in the line and it was worth it.

I ordered the #16 and I would order it again and again."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We re-visited this cute little place after ten years. It was apparently remodeled, even still very small. The home made taco!!! Still the best! We ordered enough taco with different kind of meat, with a lot of salsa:)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Everyone (including my husband) has said this place was awesome, so I went there TWICE on my recent trip to Santa Barbara.  The first night I ordered the chorizo quesadilla and the guacamole.  The quesadilla was quite good, and the guacamole too...but I wasn't really in love with their tortillas, and they don't give you any chips to eat your guacamole with.  (In my opinion, the tortillas were kind of soggy and doughy.)  Also note that in portion size, the quesadilla was very small...so I should have ordered something else besides guac to go along with it.

My second night, I came back specifically for the sope special (only on Tuesday and Thursday).  I figured I learned a lesson, so I also ordered the Super Rica Especial too.  (Kind of like chopped up peppers and fried pork?)  Well, first off, these were two FULL-sized plates.  Second, I definitely didn't like the ""Especial"" and thought the sopes were just okay.  I've had much better sopes at other places.  Super-Rica's sopes needed a bit more flavor and also were very messy/soggy.

So, all in all...it seems like a hit-or-miss kind of place.  On my third night looking for great Mexican, I decided to try a different place altogether."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"CASH ONLY HERE! They make legit tortillas from scratch here!  They are very soft and delicious. I only like the place for the tortilla.  I am disappointed in the rest. I got the steak tacos (#1). The meat was not that great, lacking in taste and was dry.  They're $2.50 for steak on top of two tortillas. You have enough meat to split it into two tacos. Warning, there are no onions or cilantro on top like the typical tacqueria tacos. Lime is not available and must be asked for.  They literally just give you meat on tortillas.  I suggest you get the ones with other toppings (like cheese...I'm lactose so couldn't).  Maybe I'd have to come back and try some other meat.  Also, there are no burritos here.  Disappointed since this place is highly rated.

Side note: they speak perfect English here"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"If Julia Child said it was good, we all know that was a loooog time ago.  Doesn't live up to the rep.  Go down the street to El Bajio or La Colmena for some real taqueria food.  You won't have to wait in line behind the tourists."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Get the rajas. Just get it. Shut up and get it. Why are you still sitting there reading this when the rajas taco exists in this world?
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Very popular with the locals.  A Julia Child favorite.  Usually a line out the door.  Very inexpensive, picnic table kinda place.  Food is good, but IMO not terrific."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Not only my favorite Mexican food, but my favorite restaurant! The food couldn't be more fresh or authentic. Definitely worth the long line!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Great service and great food! We came at the perfect time on a rainy day so didn't have to wait in the usual long line. I ordered enchiladas which were yummy and cinnamon coffee. I can't wait to go back and order tacos next time, from the looks of it those ( lots of people order the tacos)  looked super yummy as well. I can see why Julia Child came here :)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"In 1990 I read an article about La Super Rica and I made the trek from LA to Santa Barbara. Well worth the drive. Now every time I head north on the 101, I take a detour off Milpas and stand in line for these delicious tacos. I recommend bistek, chorizo, and quesadillas---all prepared with homemade corn tortillas. Round it off with a bowl of beans and an order of guacamole and you're set, the latter two can be shared with a friend."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Overated. That was my impression after eating here many years ago. It seems a lot of people rave about this place mainly because Julia Child and other celebs ate here. But as a local who has eaten at many other taquerias along the same street, my opinion is that this place is nothing special. I find the food here to be a little bland, less flavorful for the same dish than other places on Milpas St. Truthfully, I never had a good vibe for this place because I hardly ever see Latinos standing in line out front. Whenever I hear of a ""good"" ethnic restaurant and I don't see members of that ethnic group eating there, it's a cause for hesitation. 

For good, inexpensive tacos, I used to always go to Taqueria El Buen Gusto a few blocks down. Also a few blocks away, Taqueria El Bajio is delicious for tortas. If you want seafood, Mariscos Boca De Rio has whole fried Tilapia & other items. I would go to any of these places before I go to La Super Rica."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I feel so bad for the people of Santa Barbara if they think this place is good Mexican food. It was the biggest disappointment. The food is not good at all. If you've ever been to Mexico, you know that this place is not authentic. Not only did the place not even have rice OR beans, but the food was incredibly bland. The only thing that had some flavor was the stuffed tortilla filled w beans and the only flavor that had was HOT. Overly spicy w not enough flavor. Boo to this place. Save yourself a trip and go to a real mexican restaurant. 

And to all the people waiting in the line halfway down the block, please do yourself a favor. Walk away now."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,In Santa Barbara for the weekend and was craving tacos. This place is simple yet very authentic. If you want to support small businesses this is the place.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Born and bred, 2nd gen, East LA/San Gabriel Valley couple on romantic weekend in SB, so we decided to check out what all the hubbub was all about!!!  Here's the deal.  Yes, I'd call this la super ""gringo"" tacqueria, but the food was curious enough that we plan to come back and try again next time we are in Santa Barbara.

For me, what popped out was the VARIETY of menu choices for such a small place.  Including some stuff I've never heard of, packaged with some random mexican comfort foods we all know and love.  To me, that's what separates this place.  Your typical corner LA or socal tacqueria?  Well, you can only order two ways (ie. taco or burritto) and choices are  Asada, al pastor, pollo...maybe lengua, buche, cabeza, that's it.  Here, you have maybe have 20-30 menu items to choose from in addition to tacos.  They also serve beer (ie. Dos Equis, Corona, Modelo, Pacifico)!  In reality, this is decent small restaurant operating as a taco stand, and that's how you should look at this place.  The prices reflect that, but not that expensive at all.  They have some unique menu items, and personally I'd go for the Specials to get your experience.  

As far as tacos, they were bland.  My bf had the Asada, Abodabo, and Al pastor.  Honestly, he prefers a run of the mill Tacqueria de Anda or King Taco over this.  The taco's weren't as greasy as he expected (lol...a good thing), and the cuts of meat were a little larger which is usually indicative of good quality meat.  The tortillas were fresh and hand made (woman was FAST), another sign of quality and a big thumbs up from me.  But it always comes down to how you marinade the meat, how flavorful the meat is, which generally should be salty and citrusy in all it's wonderful forms, and this had no pop whatsoever.  Ideally, a VERY good taco can be eaten by itself.  No salsa or onions/cilantro needed actually... if a taco is REALLY that good.  

Best Mexican food ever?  No.  Just different.  It's obvious when looking at some of dishes coming out, that owner came from region of Mexico that was different than my parents.  The Specials, in particular, looked really tasty, and I want to try, or at least make up my mind next time I come back again.  Overall, it's a nice family operation that's well run, and all the employees seemed nice.  If I lived in Santa Barbara, this would probably be one of my favorite places to grab Mexican food Plus handmade tortillas!!! ALWAYS A PLUS!!!!!."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"note to others: this ain't mexican food. it's el savaldoran, i believe.

this place gets five stars for a good reason: the food is delish, homemade right there in front of ya (including the tortillas) and it's simple, cheap and fun.

if you're looking for decor: don't bother.
If you're looking for a short line: don't bother.

BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU, MOTHERFUCKER.

it's worth it: plan ahead, save enough time and make friends while you wait in line. i try to go before concerts at the santa barbara bowl (which is right up the street, literally) and, inevitably, i'll meet folks in line going to the show and we can talk music and art while waiting in line.

figure on waiting in line at least 30 min. your food will ready within 15 minutes usually. order a beer: it'll make those 15 minutes go nice and smooth.

fave dish: cheese soup. i know. sounds ridic, but it's amazing and you can dip other things in it.

recommendation: get an extra order of tortillas and a large side of guacamole - that way there's enough to share and pass around with all the other dishes you're sure to get."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I wish everyone would shut up about how good this place is. Honestly its better than 2 stars but because of all the hype and unwarranted 5 star reviews it gets 2. There are so many great ""authentic"" places around town that are just as good or better but you don't have to wait in a line to eat at. Don't waste your time in line just to sit at a dirty table with all the other tourists that are heading to SF or LA"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This place has the best classic taqueria style Mexican food I've found anywhere! I have been going here for 25 years and I have never had a bad experience. I love the rajas. Its a mix of satiated onions and chilies mixed with melted cheese. I get tacos and add the rajas with some hot sauce. The tortillas are hand made and fresh to order. It has a great seating area in a covered patio. It's a kid friendly establishment complete with high chairs. Usually when you arrive its got a line out the door especially around meal times. It can take awhile to get through the line and the wait for food to be prepared can be a while too but its well worth it. So don't show up hangry. Its cash only and while the prices are reasonable the orders are small so you usually order multiple dishes and feeding the family can be more expensive in the end than you might anticipate. So make sure to bring enough cash.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Lived in SB for years and was never disappointed by La Super-Rica! Cash only though.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A must stop when your in Santa Barbara ! 
Say yes yes yes to the Saturday special enchiladas 
And bring cash there is no debit or cards of any kind. 
Delicious!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I accidentally found this place when I was trying to go to La Tolteca and found it had been closed down.  On the next block was La Super Rica with a line out the door.  I knew that was a good sign so I waited my turn.  The tortillas are made on premises and are wonderful.  Everything tasted very fresh and the price can't be beat!  Having said that,  I think it is pretty average otherwise.  I had no idea how hyped this place was until after I had been there.  I was shocked!  

If you are on a budget and need cheap eats then go here.  If the line is really long then I say skip it and try somewhere else.  It didn't really seem worth the twenty minute wait I had."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Within the 600 block of Milpas in Santa Barbara are two of the best Mexican restaurants in So Cal.  La Super-Rica is the famed taco stand of old which I have been coming to since the early 1990s.

It is great stuff, small plates of food that you order ala carte, almost tapas style.  You can try a great deal of different items at one sitting and I have tried so many things over the years I can't tell which is better than the other.  I can say I haven't had a miss.

The bad news...crowds and crowds.  It is only a taco stand and you are likely to be waiting in line to order and then having a hard time finding a seat (you order and wait for your number)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,It was worth the 45 minute wait. There is plenty of seating. We got a sampling of a few things to try it all. Everything was very good. Don't miss the pork tamale!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,What can i say every time I am in Santa Barbara I stop here THE best Mexican food i have had
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Grab a snack in between meals and was looking for fish tacos.  We drove by and saw the line and the sign outside that said no credit/debit card.  Went to grab cash and came back.  The line died down.  Since the main purpose was to grab a snack, and they don't offer fish tacos, we got the Chrizo taco and the pork taco.  It was super yummy!  We will come back for more!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Hand made tortillas and well marinated meats = awesome tacos. The salsa is nice and spicy. It's a cash only spot so make sure you bring cash, otherwise you'll end up like me running up and down the street to find an ATM. There's a dozen or so taco shops on this street that look the same, but this was the only one with a line. The steak tacos are super good. It's a must try if you're in the area.

This taco shop has been approved by a San Diegan (the home of the best tacos in California)."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Stopped here on our way up the coast. I had heard about this place on Yelp and I'm always up for some good Mexican food. The line was LONG...I waited 45 minutes just to order. After we ordered it only took about 10 minutes to get our food...not bad at all. But after you wait almost an hour you expect your food to be amazeballs! And I'm a little sad to say my family just thought it was OK. We ordered the steak tacos, marinated pork tacos, chorizo queso and #16 from Man vs. Food. 

Tacos were typical street tacos...not worth the hour wait.
Chorizo queso...awesome, especially with the homemade tortillas.
#16...amazeballs!

Overall food was good and just be prepared to wait. If you want something amazing try one of the specials."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Rajas. It's all about the rajas.  And the bacon and cheese melt with the hand-made corn tortillas. It's all made out of yum.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"All home made and delicious, portions and prices are great. Best horchata I've ever tasted too! Definitely recommend this place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is owned and operated by angels. Jessie hired all his best angels to make the best food I've ever had in my entire life. If there's a long line, please wait. Also it's insanely in-expensive so buy the whole menu. You'll thank me later!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place should be called ""La Mediocre Rica.""

It was alright.  Not what it was hyped to be.  The taco I had was decent and the tamale was under-seasoned.  I much prefer burrito places like the legendary, now defunct, Tio Alberto's.  And even Freebirds is generally better than this."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I have been to La Super Rica on multiple occasions and have never had a bad dish. 

In fact I would say that I probably like La Super Rica as much as the city of Santa Barbara itself, LOL... I swear I make that 1 1/2 hour drive just for those tacos... 

But really folks, you can't go wrong with any dish there. The tortillas are fresh and the guacamole is amazing. I've had the tamales, tortas, tacos and quesadillas and still haven't scratched the surface of the menu. 

It's a quaint little blue building right off of Milpas street (drive about 1 mile off of the freeway) and there is always a line out the door. The prices are awesome and it's worth the short walk as nearby street parking is sometimes full. 

Again, I HIGHLY recommend this place. If it was good enough for Julia Child (I've heard it was her favorite Mexican restaurant) then it's good enough for me!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"OVERATED  look at all the 5 star ratings, they mostly come from reviewers that dont have many reviews.

GRINGO FOOD,

Ok, straight up, food is good, price not so great, and a long line of white folk ( I am Caucasian, or what ever you want to call me, cracker!)  not so special, huh?  Yea yea yea, so what if Julia ate here and said she liked it.  Daniel Bullard likes hamburgers.  So what does this tell you...? Tourist Trap!  Dude seriously?  Try something different.  There are so many great Mexican restaurants here in town, that most get overlooked by this place because they are famous.  If you want good Tacos and cheap go to Lilly's ($1.50) and they do all the meats you want, cabeza, ojo, cachette, adobada. If you want good Chili Colorado or Verde, go to Lito's, they rock but have gotten popular, thanks to Guy F from TV network.  Oh and the place one block over, Los Agave's, pretty darn good but expensive, but I think is much better. Also a local fave, Los Arroyo's, most locals will tell you this is a great place.  You want good Mexican food, open your eyes essay, ask around!  You will see what I am talking about."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Food has been great for 30 years and the line doesn't get any better.  But I will still go on off hours when possible.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"There is a lot of hype about Super-Rica. In fact I heard about it before I moved to Santa Barbara and when I tried it out in person, I was a tad disappointed. There was a line outside when I got there so I expected the food to be amazing, but the meat I received was a bit dry and overall, it was just average for me."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We arrived a few minutes before it opened and there was already a line, if that tells you anything. We ordered chorizo quesadillas, the Super Rica Especial, tacos de calabacita, an agua Fresca de sandia (watermelon), and a coffee with canela and piloncillo. So tasty that we ended up returning for more quesadillas the same day. On the second trip we had to wait a really long time for our food, which was a little frustrating because we just wanted a quick snack. But overall, this place lives up to the hype."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Fresh food! made to order! 
Always eat here when Im in town... Highly recommend them!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,It doesn't get better than La Super Rica! I love their food and the owner who is always wonderful and manning the order window.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Always delicious! No scenary or fancy in any sense of the word, but amazing food!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I loved the #3 taco!  I wish I would have ordered more than 1.  I wasn't sure how small the tacos were going to be.  The #12 was like a chicken quesadilla, and was good too.  The chicken was moist and the cheese was pretty mild tasting.  I like the fresh pico de gallo and tomatillo salsa.  We went here on a Thursday afternoon and the line was short.  I've been told this place gets pretty packed on the weekends.  The food is reasonably priced too."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"My boyfriend and I saw this place in a video highlighting must go places in Santa Barbara on TripAdvisor. Seeing that this place had pretty good ratings and the line that was out the door right at opening, I thought this place was going to serve the most bomb Mexican food ever. Overall, I thought the place was just okay. My boyfriend said he'd give it 5 stars.

We ordered the rajas, tacos de bistec, guacamole, and agua fresca de sandía. I was pretty surprised when the total bill was only $13, but I soon realized after I got my food why. I completely misunderstood the menu when it said the tacos come with two tortillas - silly me I literally thought each order came with two tacos. Anyways. The tacos de bistec was good, but wasn't amazing. My boyfriend had to eat the rajas because I was not a fan. The guacamole was good however and definitely stood out along with the agua fresca de sandía (which was a definite must get).

Meh, I've actually had better Mexican food in San Jose. Oh and this place is cash only!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Yum yum yum. Every time I come to this place, everything is just great. Food is simply delish and fresh! Authentic Mexican food flavor. The only thing is over price for the amount of food you get. Other than that I would come everyday if I could. Service is a thumbs up aswell. Hightly recommend this place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The line was way too long for a dry steak taco, that when you order it...it literally comes with steak and tortilla. I think cheese is like the extra price of whole other taco.

I think after I ate here with my family, we all got in a huge fight too...

about the steak tacos.

ehhhh."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is legendary because it's sooo good. Make sure you have some cash in your pocket before waiting in the long line. For that matter check and make sure they are open before you drive over.

I come here frequently when in town. About the only place I will order a taco that comes without meat (sautéed pasilla pepper).

Everything is good and fairly cheap. I would recommend trying everything but I do get those tacos as a bumper every time. The ladies in the back are always busy making fresh tortillas and try the watermelon water if they have it.

The place appears to be an old burger drive in but don't be surprised if you see a celebrity or two eating here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Love this place, the handmade tortillas are worth the trip ! I regularly eat 
the carne asada here and its delicious, not dry like another reviewer said
none of thier product sits in a steam table they turn it all over so quickly.
A yummy spot at any time day or nite !"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I grew up here in Santa Barbara. La Super Rica is one of my FAVORITE Mexican restaurants in SB. I took my boyfriend there last weekend and he was IMPRESSED! 

I always love their simple menu; these dishes are so delicious! 

Don't let the long line scare you away. It is almost always packed. :-)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Ok- cash only is  a downer. Waiting in line for 10 minutes (when there are only 3 people ahead of you) is a downer. 

But OH what a flavor!  I had an order of marinated pork tacos, with a ""plain"" order of grilled pork tacos on the side. With homemade corn tortillas, natch! Nephew had a quesadilla... which he pronounced ""excellente!"". Not bad for a kid who doesn't speak spanish, yeah? And the house-made salsa's were great! 

Needless to say, we were on the way up the coast to Pismo Beach and got a hankering for lunch as we reached Santa Barbara.  Remembering this was Julia Child's fav go-to Mex place, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Yup, it's divey. Yup, it's got a cheap-as-all-get-out roof over the eating area. Yup, the place has a crappy selection of sodas and drinks...and their menu is a bit limited - but OH the flavors are great! They get a ding for the slow service and cash-only.  But for ""street"" food that's good? You can't beat it. You really can't."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"During a recent road trip, my boyfriend and I stopped here at 11:30am on a Sunday, after some friends in NorCal told us it was not to be missed. True to all other reviews, there was a 15 minute wait - but being huge Yelp fans, we were happy to chill in line since the reviews were so positive. 

Boy were we disappointed. After all the hype, the food was just so-so. My bf's tri-tip taco was pretty bland, and my pork suizo had an unexpected sweetness to it, and lacked much flavor. I also ordered the alhambre pechuga, which was diced chicken with green peppers, onions, mushrooms on a corn tortilla. Again, nothing very exciting, about as plain as the menu description itself.

The lone bright spots were the horchata (mexican rice milk - cold and sweet, served in paper cups with ice), fresh corn tortillas (chewy and soft), and the chorizo. 

That said, though, given the line and lack-luster cuisine, we won't be coming back here to get our Mexican food fix. Final note, this is my first Yelp review ever - this place was such a far cry from Yelp's usually consistent reviews, I had to speak up! Take it from a true foodie, Super-Rica Taqueria just isn't worth your time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We happened upon this place while trying to find parking for another place, and we were pulled in by its charm and the long line out the door. The smells coming out of this place were amazing! AND you get to see tortillas being made by hand through the windows. This place was delicious. From their Bistec tacos, to their Horchatas, I definitely recommend you come to eat here!!

Also: IT IS CASH ONLY. We learned that the hard way. But you can walk to a CVS a few blocks down for an ATM."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Best Mexican food anywhere! Lines can be long, sometimes an hour wait, but the line is full of friendly people from all over, so time passes quickly. Staff is friendly, and everything is delicious. Faves are the tacos, burritos, and tortas!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Let me first start off by saying I live in San Diego, so mexi food to me is available all over.  Now, to the review.  I saw that this place was heavily yelped, so I had to check it out.  And I was aware there would be a wait.  As soon as we pulled up, we noticed the line out the door.  A line has to be a good thing, right?  We got in line, and watched the kitchen staff make tortillas and grill meats.  Pretty neat.  About 45 mins later we were able to order.  We got the Chorizo and cheez plate, and the pork special.  My bf was told that was not enough food for 2 peeps, so he also ordered the tri tip.  This was a to-go order.  The chorizo came in a small lil cup container, sorta weird.  But it was damn tasty.  All of the food was very very good, but sorta on the small side.  To me, it was more like a snack, not a meal.  I do not think it was worth waiting 45 mins for.  If I am waiting in line for something, I want to be OMG blown away.  Sadly, I wasn't.  Don't get me wrong, it was very very good, just not the best ever."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Overrated? I respectfully disagree. If there is a god, the meal I want on my death bed will be a #16--marinated pork, pasillas, and cheese in mouthwatering freshly made tortillas. Isidoro is a fixture in this community and he stands for reliably great food at a fair price in a funky setting on Milpas.
It's the number 16 that I have a hankering for when I return to town.....Mmmmmm Milpas comfort food! Nomnomnom"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Awesome
Tacos homemade 
Handmade tortillas 

Cash only

Always a great place to eat lunch"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I used to love this place, but now I don't really think it's worth the super long (45-minutes or so) wait or the higher-than-average prices.  The homemade corn tortillas are good, but the rest of the food seems either super heavy/unhealthy or lacking in complex flavors (e.g., the bean gordita was very meh).

It's too bad.  Coming to La Super-Rica while visiting SB had been a long tradition of mine."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A friend of mine from the area recommended we stop here while spending a weekend in Santa Barbara and I am so glad we came by. We were lined up a few minutes before opening (per recommendation) and made friends with the couple in front of us who have been coming here for years. Following their recommendation we got the super rica, an assortment of tacos and made sure to get lots of salsa, as well as the horchata and watermelon Fresca. I haven't had a meal so fresh and authentic in a long time. Everything was superb in terms of flavor combination and quality, and the horchata was the perfect balance of sweet and so refreshing and cold. The watermelon Fresca was the same. We loved our meal so much we ended up coming back for dinner the next night. Can't recommend enough!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What can i say: homemade tortillas, taco game on point, salsa and pico always fresh. Got nothing but love for this spot. The only thing I would change is the amount of cheese they add to the tacos if you request cheese. It's almost too much cheese- 1/2 of what they add would be fine."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"So it's true?  Julia Child has stood in line for tacos here??  On multiple occasions??  Locals love to tell me that.  over and over and over again.

Honestly 3.5 stars for me.  I've come here a few times but still prefer the convenience of El Buen Gusto down the street (close to me so it makes for an easier walk).  The parking here is a bit of an issue.  You'll more than likely resort to finding parking in the neighborhood.  And there is ALWAYS a line (though it moves surprisingly fast).

""Inside,"" the seating is actually outside under a plastic awning.  This is fine for most SB weather.  While the line is long, I've never had a problem finding seating after my order.  Even for a party of 5+  The furniture consists of plastic chairs and rather rickety tables. They all have the look of heavy use on them, and a thin film not unlike the light dirt that patio furniture accumulates after sitting out too long.

But let's get to the food...

The tortillas are the best in SB.  Hands down.  They are handmade (hand ground and hand pressed) by a single woman in full view of all patrons.  Super fresh and delicious is sort of an understatement.  They are seriously my favorite part about coming here.  5 LARGE STARS all the way for the godliness of their tortillas.

The menu here is larger than most.  But I stick with the steak options, as steak isn't usually a taco option I see all that often.  Anyway, the steak doesn't actually blow my tastebuds away, and the sauces are just okay (pico de gallo is a bit watery), but mmmmmmmm, I REPEAT, their tortillas are fantastic.  So those 3 star components gain an extra star due to the superpowers of the tortillas.  ^_^  Yup, I'm pretty sure any taco selection is going to be amazing.

Not really sure how I feel about green peppers in my taco.  Or the white cheese on some of the meat choices.  But my family loooves it.  I usually prefer getting my tacos plain with just the protein, then garnishing it myself.  But apparently, the cheese really adds something special to the tacos, as witnessed by a particularly large family pigout session, haha; so I may just switch it up from my staple order the next time I swing by here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love, love, love this place. When you're in the mood for great Mexican food this is a must!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I was doing some shopping in SB and decided to stop by for some tacos. I've heard nothing but great things about this place and wanted to try it for myself. I went after the lunch rush so, they weren't too busy. I got up to the counter and placed my order only to find that they accept only cash. So I walked a couple blocks to a ATM and came back.  I ordered two steak tacos, and took a seat. I was really looking forward to tasting the homemade tortillas.  I was so disappointed :0(  The taste of the tortillas was great but, they were sope size, not taco size and the meat was bland. I took a look around and most people seemed to be students or tourists. I was so bummed and still hungry. I have never had such tiny, bland tacos. I bet some of the other taquerias on the same street offer better food. I will not be returning to La Super-Rica"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This is not a bad review. BTW Cash Only! 

I've known about La Super Rica for over twenty years and I finally stopped in while driving through SB. So long ago, that even my Zagat guide had it listed. I just couldn't bear waiting in a long line at a taqueria because I'm usually starved. 

Ok, here's the real deal. Their meats are all flavorful and for the $2.50 per taco with two home made tortillas, you can easily make two tacos out of one order because they give lots of tasty meat. 

I tried the tamale and it was not flavorful until I put salt on it. They are thin and not like your typical masa loaded tamale. The gordita had no flavor either. 

Now, the OFF THE HOOK Pozole soup, the best I've ever had. Flavors were spot on and it was loaded (see picture).

I also had the ""taco de hongo"" (mushroom) and that was huge and very flavorful, I've never had sauteed mushrooms like that. You could make four tacos with all the mushrooms they give you.

Your best bet is to see the limited menu online. They don't have burritos, fried tacos, taquitos, chips, etc, that you would normally get at a taqueria. 

Would I go back? Yes, I would for the pozole and the mushroom taco but not if the line was around the building. To sum it up, it's like Tito's Tacos in Culver City, some people just get used to that taste."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,i'm going to try every item on the menu and report back. this shit is delicious....
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"very yummy.

i really liked the beef tacos, despite the itty-bitty servings.

dee-lish enchiladas.

nice and quick too.

if you are driving through/visiting SB, you MUST come here.

6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Very authentic Mexican food but the menu is limited.  Pretty much only tacos.
And a few specials.  There are not a ton of veggie options and no chips!  Cash only."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"If you are looking for fresh authentic Mexican food in an authentic casual Mexican food stand setting then you will love this place!! It is literally a glorified taco stand so don't judge this book by its cover. The food is simple, fresh and authentic. The best thing on the menu is the Sopes de Pollo and they are only available on Tuesdays. Everything on the menu is delicious so be adventurous! It is CASH ONLY. Don't wait in the usual long line and then want to kill yourself when you realize you have no cash with you. (There is a bigger lesson here people.....always pay in cash its what makes this country free!)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"You know a place is good when you arrive to find a line stretched down the block at 8:30 on a Thursday night.

My father-in-law picked this out of a Santa Barbara travel guide for our dinner option one night while in town. I'm only mad he didn't choose it earlier in the trip so we could have gone more than once. 

We ordered way too much food because we wanted to try as much as possible. The guacamole was well-seasoned and the portion was huge. I loved the marinated pork -- it was tender and flavorful. The chile relleno was perfection. And, honestly, the horchata was so good it has ruined all future horchata for me. 

Bring cash and a good dose of patience. Make friends with the people around you in line. And enjoy the experience."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Ok... since I grew up in the SB area I could be biased, but as far as taquerias are concerned, this place is a SOLID 5 stars.  People... don't go here if you're thinking this is the freaking best place ever known to man, it's a taqueria, it is somewhat divey, but to me that's the charm of it.  Order some stuff, chase it down with a couple cold beers, and you're ""golden"".  ;o)

Anytime I am in town visiting family or otherwise, a meal here is a MUST.  I am a huge fan of the #16, three handmade corn tortillas topped with grilled pork and a grilled pasilla chile stuffed with cheese and chopped.  Delish!  Beyond that, I absolutely LOVE their Veggie Tamal with crema, and their Chorizo Quesadilla too.  Pozole on Sundays is a must, and anytime you can squeeze in a special or two along with any of the ""standard fare"" you're in good shape if you're sharing.  Personally, sharing everything is the way to go, then you can try more of the tasty things they serve up.  

I wish I were able to visit home more often, and that includes a trip to La Super Rica too.  Yum."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I have noticed that the lion's share of reviews here are from people from out of the area, and at least 1/2 mention Julia Child.  Well and good, Julia is an icon, and was nice enough to isidro the owner to attach her name to his star.   I ate here the day it opened, and perhaps once every year or so since.  The owner is delightful, the tortillas fresh, the meat fresh.  The flavors are bland, and the salsas, while fresh, have no flavor.  The customers are usually not locals, usually yelpers or people who read sunset magazine.   You won't see many ""locals"" there, mostly out of towners.  That said, if you like it, you like it- who am I to say otherwise?       P.S.-  Hypocrite alert- I complain about out of towners at my next to least fave taco place,  but I will drive to silverlake to eat at Rickys fish tacos!  Go Figure."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I am a fan. Not just because Julia Child came here. But because their chorizo special is legit. So good. I'd highly recommend any of their items with cheese. The chorizo and pork were better than the chicken, but the chicken was still good. The adobado taco (just meat and tortilla) was great as well. And it's true what everyone says about the agua frescas de sandia. So amazing!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. We only had $20 so I asked the waiter for help on what to order for 2 people to get a good sampling of the menu. He did an awesome job, we had a veggie/cheese taco that was incredible. I will be back even with waiting through that long line."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We stopped here on the way to Big Sur.  It was exactly when they opened (11 a.m.) so there was no line.  Not knowing what to expect we asked a couple of people around us what to order.  Everything we got was fresh tasting, clean and pretty yummy.  Growing up in Southern California, I am used to overly salted and tomato sauced Mexican food.  None of that here.  If anything, it was very unsalted.  I would definitely come again, but wouldn't wait more than 5 minutes in line."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love that someone actually compared this place to King Taco and even worse in an unfavorable light. First of all, this is Oaxacan food, its a regional Mexican cuisine. Its like comparing southern food to Chicago Deep Dish pizza's, its just not the same. 

The homemade tortillas, seasoned grilled meats on their taco's, their quesadilla's, their guacamole, fresh pico de gallo, and the specials are all amazing. It has been hyped up quite a bit over the last 10 years and there are other places that are also comparable in quality with less wait but they are damn good and damn consistent here. Everytime I am in SB I am coming by."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,My bistec was dry & the rest of my order was mediocre. I guess I had high expectations especially when the line was so long. Maybe it was an off day with the cook? Pro: Fresh corn tortilla was good.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Perfect Mexican taqueria
Not fancy but AWESOME, authentic, and uncommon mexican dishes.
I've been all over Mexico many times, this is the real deal.
Just don't be a wimp and order something like chicken with peppers and onions.  Don't get me wrong, it tastes good.  This is a rare opportunity to have some uncommon items such as roasted vegetable stuffed Chile Rellanos or Banana Leaf wrapped tamales.  
Here's a tip....order off of the smaller  ""Specials"" menu board over the window where you order.  You can't go wrong."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Does not live up to the hype!  Wanted to be wowed by the food but struggled. Waited...waited... and waited to order. Then, waited...waited... and waited for our food. Unfortunately, we were let down!  In summary - Not worth it!!!  Better options exist in in SB."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Recommended by co-worker when he heard I was going for a weekend pleasure drive up Hwy. 101 from Pasadena to Santa Barbara.  Enjoyed the  2 hr. drive on it's own, but  La Super-Rica made it a perfect day!  We had chicken quesadillas & shredded pork soft tacos for lunch and order pork tamales, tortillas and spanish rice ""to go"" for dinner.  All delicious because none of the dishes seamed ""heavy"".  Looking forward to our next trip to Santa Barbara and La Super-Rica!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would.  This is an inexpensive place that looks as if it wouldn't be anything special.  That said, the food is absolutely the best Mexican food I have ever had in my life.  There is usually a line out the door around meal-times and they are cash only.  There is nothing on the menu that isn't good."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Hells yes this is good food. We love eating here. The only gripe is all the damned tourists. There should be 30 minutes or so at every local restaurant for each meal locals can jump to the front of the line. Anyway delicious Mexican food great price.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,The rajas tacos are amazing! Expect a long line for this place-the food is worth it:)
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Too oily for my taste, but I guess it's authentic seeing fresh tortillas being pressed and consumed next to the sizzling grill. 

Supermarket-purchased tortillas ain't no comparison to these ones, which have less artificial flavors and are more...soggy in texture. I have long been blinded by Americanized Mexican food I guess. 

Upon piling some grilled tri-tip and bell pepper bacon on top, you'd better eat it fast along with all that greasy goodness! Otherwise, you get depressed like me seeing it gradually coagulates. Then again, I'm just that frantic health chic. Most guys really love the meat.

Them CHORIZO are good sausages. Little spicy, little overwhelming for a brunch stomach, but...must try.

There's also yummy watermelon juice with watermelon cubes, pretty sure they add tons of sugar to it, and contrary to popular belief, it's not thirst-quenching but the exact opposite. Be careful.

Like every other person in line, we came as tourists to SB while making a mandatory stop at La Super-Rica. And like every other person, we disliked how long it took to get our food (40mins; we were among the first few parties in line too). It went downhill afterward as the line wrapped around the little place, extending past that awkward tree I adored. 
Just saying, better occupy your spot before they open at 11am."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Food was cooked well, but somewhat bland tasting. The inconvenience of cash only and long lines also puts a bit of a damper on the experience."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I always recommend this restaurant to any folks asking me, ""where shall I eat today?"" Then I answer, ""well first off, there is the place that is in the Katy Perry song, the super Rica!"" Then they get sooo excited!  But all joking aside, the choriqueso is sooo good! salsa is deli-sh, Chile relieno is quiet tasty. Every one has their favorite, because there is quite a large menu!  There is always a line! I love that my mama worked there in high school!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"When I told my brother that we were headed up to Santa Barbara for a short visit, he immediately recommended that we visit La Super-Rica Taqueria. So, what do we do? Make it our first meal in the city.

We pulled in as the sun was setting and were immediately surprised by the smallness of this place. About the size of a garage, this little taqueria was extremely busy. We had about ten people ahead of us in line. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but with a toddler along, I wasn't so sure. After entertaining her with the kitchen antics inside, we eventually made it through the doors...only to wait a few more minutes while we perused the menu. We eventually decided to try several items: tamal verduras (filled with chayote, corn, zucchini, potato, chile strips, and cheese), tacos de chuleta (grilled strips of pork steak), tacos de adobado (strips of marinated pork steak), and the Super-Rica Especial (roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese; served with marinated pork and three tortillas).

My favorite, by far, was the taco de chuleta. The meat is super tasty, cooked thin and crispy, and served up on two of the freshest corn tortillas you'll ever shove down your throat (they're probably twenty or thirty seconds old by the time they make it to your table). The tamal was tasty, but had a slight bitterness that nearly ruined it for me. I found the taco de adobado to be just okay, but the Super-Rica Especial was pretty memorable. The roasted pasilla chile strips atop the marinated pork and tortillas gave a nice smokiness to the dish. It was well-balanced and deserves a try in my book. Overall, I found the food to be really good. I just hate long waits and trying to eat when people are constantly checking out your food. 4-1/2 stars really.

If you're ever in the Santa Barbara area, you should definitely check out La Super-Rica. Just be forewarned that this place is always busy."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I've lived in Santa Barbara my whole life but never got around to trying these tacos that I actually hear more praise about from my friends who actually don't live here. The line was long as expected but did move fast. It was also cool getting to see all the food being made even before you order. Me and my boyfriend split steak tacos #2, chile pasilla tacos #7? And the mushroom special tacos. The steak was really disappointing, and not flavorful and not that warm either, it was blah. The mushroom tacos were amazing but way to rich it made me feel sick. Overall the meal was just not that good. Unless you're going just for their delicious tortillas, go to el sitio or Lilly's for just hands down better tacos."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Good as ever ! Handmade tortillas are so good! Everything is delicious and the aromas from the kitchen only enhance the experience!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,I wish I could comment on the food but it was closed . . . Total fail.  Apparently it's closed on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hours and days need to be updated.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Went here on a recent Spring Break trip and it is even better than the reviews tout.  I thought I knew good Mexican food until I came to this little hole in the wall joint.  This humble place had incandescent food!  We ordered the specials, the veggie chile relleno, the asada tacos, the beans and the sopes.  Although the beans were soupy, cooked beautifully, they were a little wan and under-seasoned and I wouldn't order those again though it's clearly a customer favorite.  I would, however, order every single other thing on the menu.  Everything was fresh, beautifully-prepared, savory, and tasted clean and honest.  I don't know if that's a good enough description, but I wanted to come here every single meal for every single day.  When I hopped on to yelp to write a review and discovered that Julia Childs loved this place, my heart sang.  Of course she did, it's scrumptious."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Sorry - I just don't get the hype. It's not that I don't like it... Food is fine, just nothing special for me. I feel like I've eaten at plenty of other places with similar quality / flavor (and some of my meals have been on the greasy side). I just do not feel it is worth waiting so long when the Mexican restaurant 1 block away runs circles around this one."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,The food is great and the service is PERFECT! The ordering window being super friendly and helpful patiently explained what Agua Fresca is and gave us small cup sample to try. His warm greetings and kindly smile delighted my dining experience. :)
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I have heard about this place for years, the food is simple and straight forward. Had 2 pork tacos and was not  really excited about the meat, it was not tender or tasty just and ordinary simple taco. Save the drive - But at least we tried it. Cheap Eats LA"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"""Super?"" ... Cha, ""Super"" doesn't even get close to describing how seriously ""Rica"" this place is.  I propose ""Holy-freaking-build-a-monument-for-it-Super"" ... -Rica.""  Our Mamma and Papa GRUB used to hit up this spot back in the day, a random dude at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia told me to hit it up (side note ... Arcadia is like 100 miles from SB ... who is this guy? Or better question ... how ridiculously amazing is this place going to be?), and then when I caught my favorite radio show, The Petros and Money Show (PMS), talking them up ... it was like the holy-trifecta of Good Grub recommendation.  And so our mission to hit up La Super-Rica Taqueria was born.  And when my one year wedding anniversary rolled around, what better town to recommend to my bride than Santa Barbara?  Yeah ...  We can check out the amazing beaches, walk around downtown, take a stroll along the bike path down by the Zoo ... and did I mentioned we might be hitting up a legendary taco spot?  Can you say ... romance?  As you pull up to the joint, realizing there's no sign up on the building ... and the line is out the door ... well, let's just say brace for something epic.  I mean seriously ... it's a hole-in-the-wall if there ever was one, but not just a hole-in-the-wall, but a hole-in-the-wall frequented by Julia Child (sorry, but now I can't get this Julia Child SNL video out of my head).  Gazing up at the menu board, I remembered from my days back as a little kid about their amazingly scrumptious tacos, but is was Money from PMS that lead me to hitting up the Chorizo Especial ...  a bowl of gooey, melted cheese encasing hearty chunks of chorizo ... matched up with a pile of fluffy, hot tortillas to make your own mini-taco-quesadilla-creations.  To our order we added a taco de adobado (aka pork marinated in happiness), an order of chile con queso (for my veggie-loving-wife), and a heaping side of guacamole.  As we waited in line, we got to peak into the kitchen and see the fresh, hand-made-tortilla-making action up close.  Everything we got was pretty much unreal ... the meat was flavorful and tender, the tortillas were out-of-this-world, and the queso ... oh man, the queso.  Let's just agree on one thing ... you better make sure you can tolerate some lactose before you hit up La Super-Rica.  The cheese was thick and rich ... so much that Baby Carlos was pretty much in shock over how good it looked ... not at the table Carlos.  We bathed everything in their trio of dangerously good salsas ... a fresca, a roja, and a verde ... all with a tiny bit of bight and a ton of sweet flavor.  It was a magical way to spend our one year anniversary ... or any day for that matter.  So thank you La Super-Rica ... I can tell we're going to make it for the long hall ... is it two early to start thinking about coming back for year two?"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Best Mexican food in SB, HANDS DOWN! Maybe anywhere (from what I hear Julia Child said)

I've had a variety of dishes here, #16 always a great choice.
No matter what you get, you'll get happy service, with FANTASTIC food. If you're coming from out of town, get off at Milpas and EAT HERE. I've loved this place as I grew up here!

The plates are generous for the price, and you come out feeling full and satiated! Pair the food with a cold Modelo or Horchata and its a match made in heaven.

Oh and the horchata is addicting! Note that you feel an horchata hangover if you drink too much, but its a great feeling of satisfaction"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is Amazing!!! Love, love, love the Chilaquiles. Best I've ever had. We've been coming here for a long time and won't ever stop! :)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The perfect taqueria. Innovative, fancy, and challenging? No, it's simple, absolutely perfectly prepared Mexican food. Wonderful!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I always stop here for authentic and delicious Mexican food! The chile rajas with mushrooms and onions is my favorite. Everything is fresh and made to order.
Remember they only accept cash!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"As a tourist, after the build up of Julia Child's history with the place, as well as many sources recommending this as a must-stop along the California coast, we were disappointed that La Super-Rica wasn't all it was chalked up to be.

After about a 20 minute wait in a relatively short line, we had to make a quick decision on what we wanted- I would suggest a menu on the outside of the Taqueria, it might speed up the line!  We made some random choices as to what we thought looked good, and waited another 20 minutes or so for our order to be available.  

Out of the 5 dishes we ordered, several seemed relatively flavourless, and the others seemed like a bunch of meat and veggies piled on the flat tacos.  They were difficult to eat, and although the dishes were different, three of them tasted almost the same.  The best were the pork tacos, but it went downhill after that... which left us pretty disappointed.  Honestly, the best part of the experience were the hot sauces which we used to enhance the dishes to our tastes.

I usually try to have an optimistic outlook on restaurants, knowing that if I don't like it, maybe it's just not my taste, but this one just didn't live up to what we were expecting!

It didn't help that there was a huge group of parents and kids who were being pretty disrespectful of surrounding diners, which was pretty annoying."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Went on President's Day around 1pm and we had to wait 1 hour just to get to the ordering window... I've waited long for food but an hour felt like I was at Disneyland.  Enjoyed the food but the star of this little taqueria are the tortillas.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Lived in Santa Barbara from 1985, not counting UCSB. Been here too many times to count. Here's what I order.

Grab a number 16, the Super Rica Especial, an order of rice, an order of guacamole and maybe a half dozen extra tortillas. Take your Negra Modelo to the table and set up your salsas. When you pick up your stuff ask for an extra plate. 

Now it's time to start making tacos, a little bit of the pork, chile and cheese stuff goes in, just a spoon of rice and a glop of guacamole covered with salsa. Oh, don't forget the pico de gallo too. 

The extra plate is for enjoying your tacos without spilling all over. Repeat until full."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Of course we know that Julia made this place famous, and it's the perfect little hole that I usually pass while driving on Milpas.  but when you do find it, it's worth the wait.  I'm guessing this is about as authentic as mexican food gets.  Order a few different tacos and I think you'll be impressed with them all."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"A bowl of queso, cash only, there are no words to describe how good this place is. You won't be disappointed with anything. Just in case... I would be sure to order queso, rajas, guacamole, and a meat and you will be the happiest person on the planet. You can't go wrong."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The best place in California. I am a Mexican food professional and I know what is the best. Wait in line, talk to your new neighbor and scarf up on the finest food made by Izadoro and his family. These poor comments are made by people who do not know what is excellent. Oh wow, paper plates and plastic spoons......yes, this is how we do it."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Tacos de hongo is the best thing I ever ate.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Like always great food I order the 
chorizo especial # 14 and a carne Asada taco never could go wrong by eating here 
The o LU thing just be ready for a a wait especially on the weekend I try to avoid Friday Saturday & Sunday"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,we stopped here on our to sb and the taco are the bomb.  the lines were long and we had heard about his place in LAand give it a try and we were glad we did. The Mexican food is fantastic.   This is my new stop over on the way north.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"For $2.50+, the tacos are priced like other places in Santa Barbara (but still twice the price of Los Angeles). That said, this place does serve up a good amount of meat on each taco that is probably about equivalent to two $1 tacos in LA, to which you can add some of their pico de gallo (5 stars) or red or green salsa (which I'm not a big fan of, but found interesting, 3 stars). 

So, why only two stars? Well, the food is served cold--you wait for a good deal of time for your food... both in line and once you've ordered, and yet it is not hot. I dare say it's cold. What's going on? I know some places benefit from inefficiency (e.g., Pink's line is slow, but there's always a seat once you get your [hot] food), but this place doesn't seem to have a reason. So, I ask--if my food was ready, why was it sitting around getting cold? 

Bottom line: The food has potential, but until they learn to serve it hot, I won't be back on my dime."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Excellent, delicious food. Worth standing in line. It moves pretty quickly and is worth the wait. Cash only, so be prepared. 
Everything is tasty. I used to live in Santa Barbara, but now only visit a few times a year. This is my favorite meal in Santa Barbara."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"After reading that Julia Child visited this place, I just had to see what all the hype was about. We were full from our heavy lunch but so we just ordered a #11 which had marinated pork with melted cheese in between two homemade tortillas. After the put it on a grill and get it nice and toasted. The meat is perfectly marinated...now I know why Julia Child went here. We were going to originally try the #16 since a lot of people raved about it...but decided not to since we weren't sure if we liked grilled bell pepper....now looking back on it, I wish we had tried it too. They have homemade salsa and hot sauce which we put on our dish. It was so good. 

Next time we are in town, we are going here with an empty stomach so we can try several items from the menu. 

The Taqueria is not located in downtown where all the tourists go, so this place is still somewhat a hidden gem. Don't let the outside fool you...step in and enjoy the delicious authentic Mexican food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Love the food. Authentic delicious and made to order! Restaurant has been here for years. We always stop here when we travel through Santa Barbara.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We drove up from Los Angeles just to get these tacos again. We waited for 40 minutes and when we got our food... we were greatly disappointed. Where did the fabulous tacos in our past memories go? It was disappointing and a major let down.  The masa didn't taste right or was undercooked.  

I always think of this place as the epitome of the perfect taco. What we were served the other night was mediocre at best.  We could have gotten better eats at home at a King Taco.  La Super-Rica what happened?   I have to admit that having no choice but to put up and listen to the stupid, self-important conversations of the boorish crowd before us didn't help."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I have been here sooooooo many times it's ridiculous!!!!!!! I always have to wait forever in line, but it is always worth it!! the food comes out nice and hot on little plates and the horchata is delish. the little covered dining area is nice and i definitely see why julia child loved this place."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Clearly, this is a local favorite. We bumped into someone in line who has been coming every week for the last 9 years. 
I get there so many people love this place. But I don't. There were just so many people and the line was long. Then you have to wait for your food and it was like warm. The tortillas are good and the flavors are good, but after waiting for 30 mins altogether, the cold chili relleno in white sauce in not as good as it sounded on the special board. 
We went to Los Agave the next night and the experience and flavors were much better."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The first time I stepped foot at La Super-Rica was in 1989 - it's good to see that the menu hasn't changes as much and that the food was just as fantastic today!

I spent the 4th of July and my birthday here and this was the one place we had to visit above all the fancy-schmancy restaurants in all of SB.  We drove by at lunch and saw the line and decided that dinner might be better.  Unlike others, I view long lines as a sign of good eats.  It was just noon and really hot that day.   Later that night, I think we got there 5 minutes before they were about to shut the kitchen down. 

La Super-Rica is a true gem and the late Julia Child's favorite taco joint.  The best sign of this is seeing the big stainless steal bowl filled with masa and little craters of scooped out dough.  I really believe the heart of this joint lies in their always fresh tortillas.  Whatever you order, just ask for more.

I opted for the marinated pork and cheese between two tortillas and my bf enjoyed the beef tacos.  In fact he went back and got more tacos.  It's funny that others have complained about the menu.  I love the menu , the on-spot descriptions and the specials board - don't forget those.  Just take your time and read it.  Whatever catches your eye & stomach - that's what you order.  As simple as that.... and the prices?? You're having a gourmet taco and it's worth it every penny!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My FAVORITE Mexican food restaurant! If we had one in AZ ; where I now live. I'd gladly stand in line for their magnificent mexican meals! When back home in LA, a two hour drive to Santa Barbara and La Super Rica Taqueria is certainly on my top 5 things to do."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is only our 3rd time here in the past couple of years but ever since the first visit, we always talk about this place.

One of our favorites here is pozole which is their Sunday special and the previous time we made the mistake of coming on a Saturday looking for it so this time seemed like a special treat. At almost 2pm, the line wasn't as bad as we've seen it, however, it was moving as slowly as I remembered. That's my only pet peeve here. The line just moves extremely slow. 

So we ordered the pozole (it's a small bowl but it's filling so if you're getting other items, it can be shared) which comes full of tender pork pieces, hominy, shredded red cabbage, diced onions, sliced radish and slices of avocado as topping. There's really more meat and veggies than the broth. It also comes with a crispy tortilla. 

We also got the other Sunday special, the shredded beef taco (excellent!) which comes with creamy guacamole, then pork tacos, marinated chicken tacos with cheese, and a plate of guacamole which comes on 2 corn tortillas. 

Although we always order too much, we always love everything we get, usually a pork, chicken and beef dish. I think we order too much bc the plates/portions are small and by the time it's our turn to order, we're way hungrier than when we first got in line so our minds tell us to order more, better safe than sorry, or hungry in this case. 

Also, I don't know how much the daily specials are (they don't say on the specials board) but things add up pretty quickly (our total was $26.) so don't let the shack and the little ""inexpensive"" plates fool ya. 

That said, I can't wait til we go back there again on a Sunday for some pozole!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,It's so good. There is always a line to order food. Love their handmade tortillas. Thanks Yelp for list this place in my feeds.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is one of those ""hidden gems"" that a lot of people know about. I live in Ventura and usually see someone i know here. You always have to wait awhile is line and parking is a pain.
The food is off the charts good and there are lots of meatless options. The staff is very nice here, as well.
On our last visit there was a B-list celebrity here. his entourage was taking up a lot of table space and not eating; just being sure everyone else knew they were special. 
Go mid-week and not between 12 and 1 and you are in for a nice treat."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We go here every time a friend visits, because it's awesome, and that's how we keep ourselves from going all the time. We've been trying all the Mexican restaurants in Santa Barbara County, and La Super Rica remains one of our two favorites.

Our favorite dishes: 
The suizas and the cazuela de queso are all good. They're basically delicious bowls of cheese.

La Super Rica especial is my favorite. I seriously dig pork, chilis, and cheese. This dish puts them all together on top of fresh tortillas. When I move away from California, this will be the last dish I eat.

The rajas, a cheese and chili dish, is amazing.

The alambres seem to always come out a bit dry, but they're excellent if you need to cut the unrelenting cheesy deliciousness of another dish, e.g. the suizas. Of course, not everyone needs to do that.

The frijoles Super Rica are a mostly normal bowl of beans. I've yet to try the tacos. The guacomole is solid, but good homemade guac is probably better.

I don't know if it's technically allowed, but we've brought our own beer and sangria a couple times and had no issues. My Hispanic fiancee says that the horchata is good, but I've never had it.

Make sure to ask for a few extra tortillas!

Seating can be tight, and the line can be long on the weekend. Street parking has always been easy for me."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I absolutely love this place. Fresh, made-to-order authentic Mexican food. Down home deliciousness. Cheap, no frills.  Order anything off the board, grab an ice cold beer or fresca and enjoy. Service is friendly. Setting is ultra casual to the point of being ""divey"" but in a good way. It's all about the food here. An SB must visit."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love this place! It is by far one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. They have the best homemade corn tortias which are made fresh to order! Try everything!!. Be prepared to wait in line and bring cash, they don't take cards!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The reviews of this place are spot on so I'll just recap. We came because Lilly's taco's (higher reviews) was closed for the day. This taco joint is off the beaten path, essentially nowhere near state street. It's worth the trip because the ambiance is cool with a feeling of history. The hand made tortillas were fun to watch as you wait in line to order and worth a photo. Skip the steak taco as it was bland. And it's just steak on a tortilla. You have to use the salsa and order a side of guac just to call it a taco. The pork was a little better.  The chicken fajita was much better with fresh peppers and onions. The vegetable tamale and chilles rellonos were good also. Be sure to get that refreshing and seasonal watermelon drink."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The number 6 is where it's at!  Anyone who doesn't like this place, probably didn't read the food descriptions closely and screwed up by ordering the wrong thing.  Food descriptions here are very accurate.  If it says two tortillas and skirt steak, that's it. No onion, cilantro, etc. but the gooey vegetarian number 6 is too die for.  And I'm not vegetarian.  Also, if the mushroom taco is on special, get it!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Homemade tortillas- amazing! Cali girl all my live and I've eaten my share of tacos - Best tacos hands down! The pinto beans were tasty and the beer was cold! Friendly service and authentic food...my new favorite place in Santa Barbara.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Warning-- the food is OK, but I've had far better Mexican in the states and across the border. Most importantly-- NOT worth the wait!  We waited on the sidewalk over an hour to place an order (there were about 15-20 people in line in front of us, split in small groups) and then an additional 10-15 min to get our food. From what we saw in the kitchen, clearly super disorganized. So if you're more hungry than patient, go elsewhere.  And regardless please know there is much better Mexican on both sides of the border! Jeesh."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"A friend recommended we come here.  Said the food was exceptional.  When we got here, there was a long line, which is a good sign, but I found the food just okay."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"""I swear it looks strange, but it's delicious..."" 

I chose to believe my boyfriend and take a chance on this raved about, well, what looked to me like a shack. 

A small place, Super Rica is certainly not small in flavor and satisfaction. My stomach was beyond full and thanking me. You basically order standing up at the cashier, while tons of cooks are slaving away at what smelled short of heaven. They have about 20 things on the menu, including some specials, all at an excellent price. 

I would hardly call it ""Mexican"" as they have a variety of plates that seem like a combination of South American dishes. They make it fast, but boy do they make it good. 

All in all, it's not a fancy place but if you're looking for fast food that won't disappoint your tum or bum, get yourself to Super Rica. 

Also, GET THE GUAC."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The best tortilla I have ever had. Anything you put on it is made better by the sheer fact that they are on the best tortilla you will ever eat. 

Down side: Insanely long line and slow service. I recommend bringing a snack and a lawn chair for the line. Not kidding. This is the only reason it is 4 stars and not 5."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Came in last night at 9:15 pm on our way home from Monterey.  They were getting ready to close.  They were out of rice and beans, darn.  BUT...they made some fresh guac on the spot for me!  It was like butter...amazing.  I love La Super-Rica!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Maybe my husband & I didn't order the right thing... I hate to be negative but after hearing this is ""a must do"" we were SO disappointed.  Anybody could throw some meat, green peppers, onions and cook em up.  Add a little flavor next time please!!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"don't see what the big deal is with this place. People wait in long lines under the heat for these tacos and the tacos have no flavor! It's pretty Americanized, I went with a friend and thank god we didn't wait that long or i would've been upset. 
I give them two starts only because they take the time to hand make the tortillas but the meat has no flavor. it taste like a fast food chain place. there's better out there."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I don't understand the hype about this restaurant.  I'm from Los Angeles and I've had much better Mexican food than what they serve at La Super Rica Taqueria.  I was really looking forward to try this place out and I'm glad I got here early because the lines get really long really fast.  I ordered the famed #15.  Wasn't anything special about it, just a whole bunch of cheese.  I also ordered a tamal with chayote and squash.  It was drenched in a cream sauce yet it still lacked flavor.  I have to say that my favorite part about this place is their coffee.  They put piloncillo in it so it has a very sweet flavor to it.  I'm heading back up to Santa Barbara next weekend so maybe I'll give this place another shot and update my review."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"If I had to choose one restaurant to eat at every day for the rest of my life, it would be La Super Rica.
I was born & raised in SB & discovered this place when I was in 8th grade (before it blew up and became the attraction that it is today). 
This place is consistently incredible and we have Isidoro Gonzalez & family to thank for such a culinary milestone.
This is some of the best food on the planet. Period."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I love Mexican food.  I have made it a personal mission to travel all over this beautiful planet to try Mexican food and to seek out the best, and La Super-Rica is among the best.

Why is it that, in this world of copy-cats, no one has bothered to copy La Super-Rica?

Normally, I would discourage this practice, but these people are doing something so simple, yet so special, it begs to be shared with the world.  They use fresh, high quality, delicious ingredients, and more veggies (and more unique veggies) than most taquerias.  On my last visit, I had to wait about 40 minutes just to place my order, but the food was worth it.  Come prepared to wait, perhaps with a good book.  Parking will be tricky.

I ordered a quesadilla with grilled pasilla peppers and a queso fundido with chorizo.  My daughter had what she said was the best chicken quesadilla of her life.  To simply call it a chicken quesadilla is sort of an insult, because that's what they make at Chevy's or El Torito, and this was something so much better.

La Super-Rica is closed on Tuesdays, so plan accordingly!  You don't want to get your heart broken."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Just amazing!  Fresh unique flavors and fast friendly service. Special chicken enchiladas with cream sauce had so many layers of flavor but so simple. Great place for kids too. Can't ask for more
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Wow. I am not sure I can add much more insight to how good this food is. This is place is amazing. 

I would drive the 3 hours to Santa Barbara just to eat here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"My boyfriend and I go here all the time. It's amazing. We order the La Superrica Especial (#16) every single time. Make sure you look out for the daily specials. All of the tamales (vegetable, fish) are really good. The plates are way better than the tacos, so unless you're short on cash or not that hungry, don't bother with the tacos. The tortillas are AMAZING. They offer 3 amazing salsas (in order of personal preference): tomatillo, pico de gallo, and salsa roja.

Drinks: The horchata is not traditional, but it tastes like heaven. It's a little bit sweet, so let the ice melt a little before you start sipping away. The jamaica is tart, refreshing, and addictive. If you go during the spring/summer, sometimes they have aguas frescas. YOU MUST order one (sharing isn't the best idea in this situation).

It's cash only, so make sure you stop by an ATM before you get in line!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,I don't hate the tacos (which are just meat on a tortilla) but the wait was super long and they got our order wrong twice. They don't put anything on the taco but they have a bar to put things on it. All the toppings were gone and the few that were there are covered in flies. Nowhere to sit and overpriced for how basic the tacos are. Might as well go to Taco Bell.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"After years of coming here, I have to finally update my review. Sorry La Super-Rica.... o used to love coming in every time we would be in the area or driving through but lately, a lot is left to be desired. The specials are still my go-to, love love the Chile Relleno with cream sauce. But the meat tacos portions have grown smaller over time as well as the size of the tortillas that I dream about. Pretty bummed. Our last there was quite disappointing.

2 stars for the super friendly guy at the cash/order window. He is so sweet and always smiling."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Way overrated. The tortillas are good and I liked the enchiladas however the meat in the steak taco were dry and the flavor sucked.. Its not terrible however its far from authentic Mexican food and is something I would expect to get from a crappy Mall cafeteria.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"The food is really fresh, they make the tortillas there and we saw how they roasted the fresh peppers. Prices are affordable and the line long. Unfortunately, the meat was very hard. We ordered bistec and costilla and both were hard to chew. Guacamole was superb."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Okay so I saw this place on Man vs. Food and since I had a trip planned over there I was destined to see what the fuss was about. waiting in line is probably the least fun, this place gets super busy! Never a short line, so that in itself tells you something. I got grilled chicken tacos and they were alright, above average I would say. The number 16 is awesome though! The chorizo quesadillas are amaaaazing as well I went back and ordered two more to go and waited an additional 45 mins. So basically you gotta go big when you come here to avoid waiting in line again. Portions are not too too big so that's another reason to order as much as you think you are going to want. over all good place, I'd go again next time."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This place is Amazing let me just put it this way I am a Mexican from Mexico and this place feels like if I was eating at my moms they know what they are doing in the kitchen
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The best Mexican food in Santa Barbara? I believe it deserves that title... La Super Rica always has a line. The food is worth waiting for. I always order the #15. Lots of melted cheese and bacon served with fresh tortillas!!! The tortillas are hand made and delicious. The guacamole is excellent on their tortillas. The tacos are delicious, they have a good variety. I have also had several of their different tamales that they offer on the special menu. They are all good! I also like the Chile relleno, it is served with a cream sauce that is to die for... order many different items, the portions aren't huge... you can always take home the leftovers, they'll still be delicious the next day. I highly recommend eating here every time you want good Mexican food."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I was really hoping that this would be amazing because the line was so long but it's only okay. We had the bistec, tritip, beans, chorizo, and oaxacan tamale. The tamale was on special and definitely the best part of the meal. In general, the meat was overcooked and undersalted. A lot of the food had bacon in it but the food didn't taste like it. The tortillas were really nice and soft but were missing the balance of tasty meat."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"This place is incredibly slow. Not just a long line - incredibly slow. When I was there, it was so disorganized that half the people in the kitchen were doing nothing. Once we ordered, we waited more than 45 minutes for our food. 

Which was not that filling for the price, and totally mediocre.

I would never go back."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Agree with some of the other reviews...way too hyped up.  There is definitely potential here.  But the food lacked seasoning for the most part.  We ordered #16, which was good.  But our guacamole and the other meat dish we ordered needed salt.  My bf said the horchata was too sweet and the large was in a small-ish cup."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is just awesome!!  I've had the #7 (grilled tri-tip), the #16 (roasted chile with pork), and the tacos de hongo (mushroom tacos).  All of them have been amazing!!  Their green salsa is delicious.  I can't praise this place enough...  My friends and I have driven from LA to Santa Barbara for the express purpose of eating here.  It doesn't get much better than this."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"the sopes were out of this world. but the line sucks... i have no idea why it takes so long to order. seriously, we stood in line for over 1 hour. by the time we were able to order we were famished and spent way too much money! (ok, so we ate it all, but we could have ordered 1/2 if the line weren't so long!)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I came here on a recent trip to SB because I have heard so much about it and it isn't everyday I find myself 1500 miles from home on the Central CA Coast. I came here with some friends. I ordered my usual, 2 tacos, horchata and some arroz Mexicana. Of the 2 tacos a I tried, I recommend the the adobada (similar to al pastor) more than the bistec. I found the steak to be a little chewy, and it's hard to argue with the flavorful marinade on the pork. My friend ordered the Super-Rica Especial and I definitely want to order that next time. It has a generous portion of the pork and pasilla pepper strips and cheese on top of tortillas. This place is legit and I want to come here every time I visit SB."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We stopped by here on the way to SF from SD and enjoyed it so much that we stopped for lunch again on our way back. I like everything about this place except for the line you have to wait in and that I can't go here often. I can't blame them for having a line. A lot of really good places are really popular. The food was great! I had sopes which were freshly made and delicious and I also had some tacos and tried some enchiladas (remember I went twice, I didn't eat this all at once). Their food is different, it is like other taco shop food, but with fresher, more vibrant flavors. I found the guy taking orders to be really helpful. Is it worth it to wait in line and possibly drive out of your way? That depends on you. It depends on whether you eat because you have to or go out of your way to eat something really good and different. If you do the latter then I think you will like it here."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"La Superica is a good old fashioned taco stand where you order your food, pick it up at the window and grab a table on the patio. A nice cold beer and some authentic mexican food - just my speed.  It has become a Santa Barbara tradition for us on the way home from wine tasting. 

I recommend ordering a bunch of different items to try (they are all small). They always have daily specials which are usually my favorite dishes - especially the tortas.  I really like the guacamole,  fresh tortillas and assorted salsas.  We usually just order extra tortillas and make tacos out of everything we ordered - just be sure to order something with melted cheese!

Tip: Go on a weekday at an off time.  Drop someone off to get in line while you drive around to find parking. Then, while they are ordering grab a table on the patio."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place gets my first 5-star yelp rating! I was stuck in CA b/c of the snow storm in NYC (I know, I know, poor me) and ended up tagging along with Meg to Santa Barbara (oh, 101 how I love you). We went here for lunch and waited about 45 minutes in line, but the weather was nice and I was in desperate need of vitamin D, so I didn't mind. Once we got in, we ordered a #16, a chorizo quesidilla, guacamole and pacifico. The food was super delish and all made totally fresh - even the tortillas! There is nothing, NOTHING better than home made corn tortillas! The only way the experience could have been improved was if the patio was uncovered and I could have sat in direct sun. Thank you La Supre-Rica - you made this former CA-ian very, very happy!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"What a cute little restaurant with a large outdoor patio for seating. We arrived 20 minutes before the restaurant opened. By 11:00AM, there was a line outside and around the corner. Glad we were the 2nd,  3rd, 4th, and 5th in line. What did we order...we ordered some tacos, the quesadillas, and some chile rellenos. To describe the food, it is fresh, flavorful, delicate, and definitely gourmet. The prices are reasonable and comparable to the other taqueria a few blocks over. This was a surprise to me, because the food quality is much better and less greasy at La Super Rica Taqueria than the other taquerias a few blocks away. 

The tortillas are hand-made right in front of you. You can ask them to cook them a little longer. The chorizo is homemade because I saw the cook pull a handful of it from a container before plopping it on the grill. The marinated pork was light, not greasy, and it had a hint of smokiness. The chile rellenos can't get any fresher especially when the entire bin of chiles are sitting in the kitchen right in front of you to see that they are indeed fresh. Unfortunately I can't say much for their salsas because it was basic. I can imagine that if additional attention was made to upscale the salsa, it would elevate the flavors of the tacos even more. 

In all, La Super Rica Taqueria is a must for a Foodie in search of real ethnic food far from the commercialize State Street. It's outdoor covered patio seating only with a few limited tables indoors. The lines are always long. The prices range from $2.50 to $12. It's paper plate and plastic forks so don't expect any servers. A ""must go to"" if you are in town. It's great simple food at it's best!!!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We were curious because we read that Julia Child used to come here often. We decided to give a try. Line was too long, which was probably a good sign. We waited in line for 15 minutes and finally gave our orders through window. There were many items in the menu, my friend told me that only one item may be very small, so I picked three items: one steak taco, one chicken taco and another cheese taco. We waited another 15 mins for the food because they were making fresh tortillas from zero. They were delicious. They have seating. Only one restroom for all. Prices were very reasonable. I also got Mexican coke with real sugar, which tasted nice. My friends had a special rice drink with cinnamon. Overall, good food if you have time to wait. Plenty of street parking, they have parking enough for three cars."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place is delicious! The staff is friendly, the food is reasonably priced, it is mellow and always packed, which is a testament to the business. Definitely coming back as soon as the opportunity allows."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Are these reviews fake? I literally came here for the first time and I kid you not, but these tacos are absolute trash!!! The meat is dry, has absolutely no flavor, and tastes god awful. The service was just as bad as well. I waited an hour for the food, and they still messed up the order. I had to wait an extra 30 minutes and was forced to wait at the window begging them to just get my drink. I didn't pay for such garbage service and food. Literally, the tacos at Taco Bell are 10x better than the shit I received. It's absolutely embarrassing to even see Mexicans sitting down enjoying the food. Why is there even a line???? Seriously this food was so bad. This was my first time here, and expected way more. I am extremely disappointed and even more disappointed in Katy Pery for even recommending this in her song. Garbage ass crap tasting over hyped piece of trash place to eat. No wonder there's a sign on the window that says ""cook wanted"" lol. I can literally make better tacos than this at home. Should I open up a restaurant and call it ""MEJOR QUE BASURA""?"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This was just what I wanted. Lots of meat (me pork, bf steak, I tried cheese, too). Fabulous homemade tortillas. The agua fresca de melon was the best I've ever had for sure - chunks of cantaloupe. Salsas were great - fresh and variety. Tried them all. Comboed and made it perfect! Sooooooo good for the ride home!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Tried to go to Lito's, but it closed at 5:00, so we went back here.
Loved the # 16 though it wasn't as described on the menu. It was described as a stuffed chile, and it was all chopped up and covered with cheese, not stuffed.
The tamale was just ok. We've had the tacos before, and really liked them."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"If your in Santa Barbara and you want tacos this is a must. A small little taqueria so it's easy to miss even tho it's on a corner the dead give away would be the line of ppl waiting to order. DONT BE DISCOURAGED , it's worth the wait. Trust me. The menu is easy to read and the tacos are simple but delicious. The meats are tasty and tender I ordered the chorizo quesadilla, adobado quesadilla and 2 beef tacos all were great but the star of the dishes are the homemade tortillas omg!!!! So light, soft and good can eat them all day. So if you're looking for some good tacos check them out lines don't lie."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,This place is great! Stopped here on my drive home to LA from the central coast for the first time. I was lucky enough to be there when there was no line. The food is totally worth the wait tough. One of the best things on the menu is the chile stuffed with cheese. I can't wait for the next time that I pass through SB again.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"So we did a road trip from LA to SF and wanted to hit cheap eats along with the way.  First stop: La Super Rica.  Located in a rather unimpressive building, the first thing that caught my attention was the line out the door.  After about a half hour wait (and getting hungrier by the minute), I admittedly ordered much more than I should have.  For two of us, we had:

- #16 Super Rica especial (roasted chile pasilla stuffed with cheese and marinated pork) - good with a nice kick
- #4 Tacos de adobado (strips of marinated pork steak) - really juicy and full of hot, steaming strips of flavorful meat) - huge portion
- Chorizo especial (basically sausage with quickly coagulating cheese) w/ fresh homemade tortillas - unexpectedly, this was my favorite.
- Side of guacamole
- Horchata (so yummy)

This was a great place.  The homemade tortillas were the best part.  Overall, a bit on the pricy side (and very ""gringo"").  But definitely would hit it up again if I'm ever in SB."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Love the steak tacos! Best steak in town and a whole meal for only $2.50! Took a star off because the wait time is ridiculous.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Nope. The food isn't free-range or organic yes (horror, you have to wait outside in the sunshine in line) and maybe it's not going to wow an East-Coaster (some of these reviews defy logic.) But I've lived here my whole life and I appreciate a good SB taco or burrito when I taste one. 

There's a reason that this place is so popular and it's definitely not because of Yelp. It had lines going out the door and down the street BEFORE THE INTERNET EXISTED. 

In the good old days, if you didn't speak Spanish viably, you might not have gotten what you expected. Mostly local Mexicans used to frequent this place and you'd see the odd gringo in line (and yes, sometimes Julia Child) so that's a testament to how authentic this place can be with it's choices. The homemade tortillas a revelation (made with white corn, not yellow, a huge difference.) If you're used to East Coast Mexican food (what on earth is that, really?)....well, you will probably be disappointed. 

If you want great food and don't want to wait in line too long, go off-peak hours and enjoy the simple, perfected Mexican food that you can get here for a small amount of money relative to the tastiness!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"We really enjoyed the food here. Essentially Mexican small plates.  I wish we'd known that when we ordered, we would have ordered more!  The food was excellent!  Although not typical cheap Mexican food prices, it was typical cheap (albeit good) Mexican food either.  It was definitely worth it! We'll  definitely return if back in Santa Barbara!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,The chicken enchilada special was off the hook. The tacos tasted really bland and whatever. Guacamole was tasty. Be sure to was it all down with horchata because their free water tasted disgusting; they probably collect and store it in a plastic container.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Its good, gross bathroom, plastic chairs, duct tape on wall, little parking, and yes, I'll be back, its that good. 

Number 16 and 17 are good and cheesy. One had tons of peppers, but not the hot parts. Good! 

I'm from Seattle, so I don't eat a lot of good Mexican food. But there is a lot of good food there. 

Tacos here are top notch, cheese melted just right, not greasy"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"I had the special which consisted of marinated pork and cheese mixed with a charred chipotle chile over freshy made tortillas. Pretty tasty. That plus a Jamaica agua fresca cost about $10. So why just two stars? Two reasons: 1) the food is fine, but I've had much better at many places in San Diego and San Francisco for the same price and 2) the service is very, very slow. By the time I had made it through the line and received by food it had been an hour and 15 minutes. This was on the day after Thanksgiving at around 1:30. Simply not worth that wait."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"I like La Super-Rica but be warned, as others have pointed out you need to order several tacos to have a meal since the portions are small.  The location is a bit sketchy so unless you want to use your leftover change to pick up a prostitute, I'd eat and run."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This was an impromptu stop for lunch today as we drove down the coast.  Great food, great service, and fun experience.  

Like others have said -- there's a line (our wait was about 30 minutes), the menu is on a board once you get into the shop (so be able to make somewhat quick decisions), and the owner who takes the orders is very helpful in answering questions and making recommendations.  There is no sense of being rushed even though you're conscious of the long line behind you.  Yes, they run out of things. Yes, the specials are particularly notable.  But, so's the guacamole, the horchata, and the #16!  The place is clean, family friendly (except for the wait), and one-of-a-kind.  

Enjoy!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Glad that Julia Child was willing to review a taqueria!!!  This restaurant is an amazing find in the high rent Santa Barbara district.

The tortillas are FRESH and TO DIE FOR!!  Many restaurants have a good marinade, but the tortilla makes it extra special.

My only nit is that they don't offer chips and salsa as an appetizer.  Otherwise, it's the best restaurant of it's kind."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is one of the best taco stands I have been to in the US.  On my last visit, I had the posole (A pork and hominy soup) and it was great. The chile con queso was also great."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,I have been here many times and I have ordered the mushroom taco every time. I highly recommend it. The rajas con queso are also worth having. It is well worth the 45 minute dive and half hour line wait. I hope to try everything on the menu as a New Years resolution.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Our family favorite for 25 years! Gotta get the super-rica special. My grown sons come home to their favorite lunch spot every chance they get.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Summary: overrated. tasteless food, long wait that isn't worth it, and more pricey than it seems. Go elsewhere..........

We came on a Sunday night around 7 and waited 40 minutes to get our food. So be prepared to wait while hungry if you do decide to come to this taqueria. It's about how much you might wait at a popular restaurant without a reservation.

We ordered our food, which was the beef tacos, tamales, quesadilla with pork, guacamole, and the side of beans. While the prices were seemingly low, for the amount we paid we felt like we should have gotten more food. about 2-3 items would just satisfy but not fill a person. It was about 50$ for a family of 4 after drinks and all. 

The food wasn't as great as any of us expected it to be. The beef for the tacos was dry, and plain. I would have expected some sauce or something but it was just tortilla and meat. I understand thats the style of the food but it wasn't particularly tasteful so why bother. Wouldn't want them again if I had a choice. 
The tamales were better in flavor(they were vegetarian) but in 2 of the 4 we ordered, we found pieces of plastic lodged in the middle of the tamale! We concluded they were those zipper sliders from ziploc plastic bags. Not edible! Really?

So yeah, its overrated. 
Service(wait time) 4/10
Food taste 3/10

6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"We had to check this place out with all the Julia Child hype!  Though I definitely think it was fun to try once - I can see why it has some mixed reviews!  It's definitely not your typical Americanized Mexican food - so don't go in expected that.  We tried the steak tacos, pork tacos, quesadilla, chille relleno with cream, horchata, and cafe de olla.  Here's the Pros & Cons:

Pros:  
- Yummy & soft tortillas - they seem very fresh!
- The Horchata was delicious -  Very flavorful!!
- The Cafe de olla we got iced and that was also surprisingly good!

 Cons
- The line! They open at 11am and we got there at 11:06am - there was already a relatively small line forming.  The staff seemed pretty slow and we waited in line much longer than expected.  There's no shade so bring a hat & sunscreen!

-  The lack of flavors and ingredients in the tacos.  The tacos were simply meat and tortilla.  No cheese, no lettuce, no spices, no veggies, no tomatoes... just literally meat and tortilla!!  This made them pretty plain : (.  The meat wasn't even special.  You can add your own salsa -- but the salsas are nothing to get excited about.

- The lack of side-dishes.  You get exactly what you order.  This is no fun because our typical Americanized-Mexican restaurants usually give you chips, beans, rice, etc.  So, I missed my sides!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"They get great reviews.   The food is unique and not truadional burritos.  My wife and I both love the #16 special.   Pork, poblano pepper, onions, served on freshly made tortillas.   Delicious."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,Went on a Sunday after church and the line was fairly short when we arrived. Not for long tho. The food is fresh fresh and so flavorful. Prices are ok but you eat on paper plates and with you plastic utensils. Just a situation I don't like. Salads delicious. As long as your mind knows it's picnic style you'll enjoy. We did!
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"The line snakes down the block for this place for a reason.  It is AWESOME!   The tortillas are hand made before your eyes and the food is inventive, authentic and tasty.   A must visit whenever we come to Santa Barbara or Ventura."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This place doesn't require another good review for you to finally give in and try it.

The lines are long and slow, for his reason, the food is outstanding! I had the #15, bacon queso, and it's sooo good. They even have 805 in a bottle.

Seating can be a challenge, but just be prepared, and come with plenty of time to spare."
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,"Reviews like this place are given make yelp soooo frustrating... I might just be spoiled coming from San Fran with some of the countries best food, but this place is NOT no where close to what its rated. I was encouraged by the smell and hand made tortillas I saw, but when it came down to taste... Blah blah bland!! I feel bad for all you people who have this place 4 and 5 stars! I just want to grab you by your simple little hands and take you to try some actually GOOD Mexican food! Oh we'll, just drove through and saw the ratings, I won't make the effort next time. I had the 11, 1 and 3, and the horchata, which was waaaay too sweet.. Enjoy SB, ima leave this place with y'all :)"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"Ohhhhh a foodies delight! A favorite of Julia Child (true story), la Super-Rica is indeed super. Have taken many a die-hard mexican food critic here and they all walked out the door with the same happy ""cat that ate the canary"" expression on their faces... A must visit whether you are a visitor or a resident of this fine little town. Yummmmm!"
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,negative,Overhyped. As in there was a Ferrari parked in the lot outside because it's popular amongst Angelinos.  It's just straight up Mexican food. Seriously nothing special and definitely not worth the ridiculous wait. They had tamalitos which vaguely reminded me of my mom's pastels (or pasteles) but only because they were wrapped in banana leaves not because of the taste.  The husband tried it 20 years ago and it's still not that great. Listen to the lovely Julia Child in regards to French food. Go to El Sitio taqueria or Los Arroyos for sit down Mexican.
6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,La Super-Rica Taqueria,Mexican,positive,"This is my food sanctuary in Santa Barbara. I'm convinced that chorizo especial is the key to longevity and happiness. 

As much as I can think of positive things to say or write about this place it just doesn't seem to do it justice...

If I was on death row and they asked me what I wanted for my last meal I would say ""chorizo especial and an order of guacamole with extra tortillas.""

Sometimes I worry this place will close. I have nightmares about it, really.  C'mon Martin - find someone to take over the family business when you guys decide you can't do it anymore. Let me rest easy - I'd be glad to start the first franchise (who am I kidding - I'd overdose on chorizo especial in about a week and a half). 

I've heard that it was one of Julia Child's favorite places to eat in SB and I totally believe it!"

cbX2XHrun39yJBND451_oA,Goleta Bakery,Mexican,negative,Mexican pastry bakery with donuts too.  Street parking only.  Grab a tray and pick your own pastries.
