bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"The chick that works here is seriously retarded. Spacey as fck, dosent pay attention, and can't take an order. 

Its IV, so can't expect much. 

The pho was a little funky... wanst a huge fan of the broth, but it had a lot of veggies and tofu in it, so i was fairly satisfied. 

Iced coffee was good. 

meh."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"It's okay. If you do not have a car and need some photos after a crazy night I guess this would be the best spot available in Isla Vista.  The broth needs depth, there is some flavor, but you need to add tons of spices and other sauces to make it worth while."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Honestly this place is pretty good. I've gone here several times and never had a bad experience. Food is good and the workers have all been cool, the only negative I could say about the place is that it's slightly over priced, specially for being in IV. I typically go to noodle city but if I wanna go somewhere close then pho bistro is convenient and pretty good, would suggest going there if you want a quick pho fix."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"My son got a pho and thought it was ok. My daughter got the tofu pad Thai and she said it was horrible. It tasted very bland, with almost no flavor, also, it was super spicy!! All in all, we didn't really like the food here."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,The pineapple fried rice that I ordered was very delicious. Also service is good and the environment is very positive.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I wish this place was more awesome. I love hanging on Pardall. The food was not the best. In fact, not very authentic either. Service was def not with a smile either."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Boba was hard and smoothies were overly sweet. If you're used to going to good boba places don't bother here. Very disappointing.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"This place is relatively smaller than other pho places in Santa Barbara. The food in general is tasty although I think they probably include MSG in it. I love their beef sandwich and the chicken one too. However, their boba is slightly pricy."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"New owner, things have changed. Drink menu has grown. Haven't tried many. I personally think the Thai Iced Tea is no longer the same. However, the Vietnamese Iced Coffee is pretty good. Sadly, last time I ordered boba it was too mushy. It was near closing time, I don't know if that had anything to do with it.

There's a menu insert with newer items, I would skip it. Maybe some of the items are worth a shot but I'm too scared to try now. One night I ordered the Chicken Pan Fried noodle to go and, to my despair, it was not what I expected. I don't know what happened, in my mind the dish looked different, even the picture on the menu was different. I even wondered if it was a mistake. Imagine crispy deep fried noodles like the ones you put on top of a Chinese chicken salad drenched in a sauce with barely any chicken. Not the most pleasant experience.

For now, I'm sticking to the egg rolls, Bánh Mi sandwiches, Rice dishes, Bún bowls, and Iced Coffee. I wish the broth was tastier... don't usually buy Pho here unless I'm craving a hot bowl of soup. I genuinely enjoy Vietnamese cuisine and crave it often, but some menu items here are a miss. I really like those places where the menu is small, but you know everything tastes amazing. This place has variety, but most dishes are mediocre. Alas!!!! I still come here. It's conveniently near campus and sometimes you need some egg rolls to get you through finals, right? ;-)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I was really hesitant to try this place because of the poor reviews. It isn't ""oh my gosh"" amazing, but it was good enough. I would definitely go back if I was in need of a pho fix. Noodle city is much closer to me, but they fail to cater to a vegetarian audience, so I never go there. 

I ordered the vegetable noodle soup with tofu and it was good. There were tons of noodles and vegetables. So much so that I ate some at the tables outside of pho bistro and the rest at home and promptly passed out afterwards. I'm not sure if that is a good or bad sign. I also had a taro milkshake, and I can't complain. It was tasty. If I was craving pho in IV, I wouldn't hesitate to come here. The service was good as well."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I recently found out that their ""veggie"" pho broth is actually beef-based and they never had a veggie broth. I guess I was being lied to every time I asked. Misleading costumers about the ingredients of their food is pretty shitty. But if that doesn't do it for you, my roommate also found a bug in her bag of sprouts. 

If you do decide to eat here, order your food to go and wash your veggies at home."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"When this place first opened, it was terrible. Then, It got better, and then gradually got worse again. I got vermicelli today for lunch and could not get over the fact that some ingredient in the dish tasted like propane. I literally could not get over it. Whether, it was the fish sauce or the vermicelli or the meat, I couldn't finish it. I don't get sick from eating a lot of stuff, I mean, I've put down spoiled milk and bad food and been fine. But I definitely got sick after this. I've been raised on Viet food all my life, but good god, nothing ever tasted like this. Pho is decent though."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"The servers & managers are honestly the nicest people ever. Mr. Lee and Miss Kelly are the cutest and friendliest workers ever as well! They just speak really loudly, which gives the impression that they're rude...but that's how a lot of Vietnamese people speak! 

Service: A lot of people complain about the service, but do keep in mind that they are very understaffed. It is extremely difficult to both cook and serve at the same time, especially on busy days. They really do try their best! Pho takes HOURS to prepare and the broth takes a lot of work to maintain-- this goes for most Vietnamese food. Cut them some slack. They even offer free samples! And the other workers are extremely sweet as well.

As for the food: my boyfriend and I love their beef fried rice. It's simple and yummy. Their pho is delicious on cold, SB days when you're too lazy to go out (and of course...they're the best cure for your IV hangovers). I also love love love their coffee milk tea!!! Their banh mi isn't how they're traditionally made in most SoCal places (cold cut meat, veggies, etc) but their beef banh mi is still really really good!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"The fried rice is a decent deal if you're really hungry. A huge plate for $8. It's a really convenient location so people go here. Typical IV food place. 2 stars say ""Meh. I've experienced better."""
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Went there for lunch and the place must have changed owners and chefs. The food got bland and the staff has been replaced with slow and sloppy staff. Our waiter brought me a cup of water with a tiny rock and spilled sauce all over my backpack. 

The sandwiches are still a good deal but the vermicelli Bun bowl is mediocre. I will now be returning there."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Solid not going to complain, I mean they are doing it... bringing pho to mainstream America (well UCSB that is).  I wish they were here when I attended UCSB but better late than never.  

I had the Pho Tai and if you are craving pho then this may satisfy your craving.  However, I prefer my thin slices of meat rare and thin.  My noodles were a bit limp and I like my bean sprouts crisper.  I also would have loved me some more jalapeno, limes and Thai Basil.  Can't get enough of the Thai Basil.

My sister got her usual bowl and WOW that was amazing.  I would definately reccommend that.  Ban Cha Gio Tom Thit Nuong a lovely medley of Rice noodles, egg roll, grilled shrimp choice of pork or chicken served atop of lettuce, cucumbers, bean sprouts, cilantro, crushed peanuts and served with a ddipping sauce (containing fish sauce I'm guessing).  Solid.  It's also called the #32 in case you are wondering.  This bowl is bursting with flavors.  My sister got the pork and it was tender and full of flavor.  Addiciting.

The 2 young men behind the counter were very sweet and lovely.  Although I'm more of a salty girl but when it comes to Vietnamese Coffee, I go all out.  Give me the 2 inches of condensed milk.   They go light here, maybe just looking out for you.

Yeah a bit pricey for a Vietnamese joint but I'd rather spend 10 bucks on a meal here then spend $7 at a drive thru.  Much better for you and go ahead and titilate your senses.  You can alwasy douse your pho with Siracha or Hoisin Sauce."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"It kinda surprises me to see the bad reviews! I think I've had good luck (or some others have had bad luck :/), but I've gone here quite a few times over the years, and had really good experiences. The food isn't the best Viet food in the world (I mean, it's SB), but it's definitely one of the better places in town. And they had great late-night hours. Both of the servers working were super friendly, and regularly checking in to see if we had been helped, or how everything was (but didn't check in too much). They were also really great with recommendations. Also - get the sunset passion tea with rainbow jelly! Holy crap, that was delicious."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Got spring rolls and their shrimp fried rice since we were skeptical of getting pho at a place where the people did not know how to speak vietnamese. Spring rolls were alright, definitely not the best I've ever had but they were decent although a little plain tasting if you didn't douse it with sauce. Whatever, the thing that was really bad was the fried rice! First of all, it was all orange... And tasted like I don't know did they use ketchup or some tomato sauce to make it? The rice itself wasn't even good. The shrimp were orange too and gross. It was super greasy too. Not appetizing at all. It was shared between three girls and we didn't even make a dent in it. Van D lost her appetite and didn't even want to try it... Have we been too spoiled by the Vietnamese food we have available in the San Gabriel Valley and Westminster/Garden Grove area?! I dont know, either way it didn't taste good."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Despite what many people say, the pho here is pretty decent, for IV at least. Yes it's expensive (8 dollars for a bowl), but I tried Noodle City's, Saigon Noodle House's, and New China's pho, and nowhere beats this place's noodles. I really like the noodles here because it's not too soft and it's quite chewy. I usually get their egg rolls and either the rare beef or brisket. Also, their extra noodles is only 50 cents! Quite worth it in my opinion. Good place to go when you want pho and in a hurry. :)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,Pho bistro is amazing! Every time I eat there I get great food and fast service!! I would highly recommend eating here!!
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Good god- food as crummy as this should be cheaper. Here's my review in 5 words: bland, poor quality and overpriced "". Go to free birds it's right around the corner."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"My roommates & I decided to try this place out. The pho is okay but it's pretty pricey. We also got pork fried rice, beef chow fun and the tofu pad thai at about $9.45 per plate. All of the dishes were mediocre at best. I would definitely try somewhere else. However, their smoothies/drinks are very yummy but again pretty pricey starting at 5$."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Brand Spanking New Opening.

The pho here looks better than the ones from Saigon Express around the corner, but their dry dishes (vermicelli and rice plates) did not make me happy...not at all!

I ordered the bbq beef vermicelli with fried egg roll, when i received my food there was a bowl full of vermicelli, one egg roll (about 1.5 inches long) cut into two bite sized pieces, and a handfull of lettuce. 

thats not what it's supposed to look like! its supposed to have carrots and bean sprouts and more meat and more egg roll! and whatsup with the fish sauce? isn't it supposed to be orangey red? why did they give me a soysaucy one...is that something that's usually put it in? i'm not used to it. 

this is not a review of their pho, so when and if i do go back, i will update."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Pretty expensive compared to other pho restaurants. The banh mi and pho are both smaller but more expensive. Got the chicken pad Thai once and it was the blandest thing I've ever tasted before. Do not get it. It's in IV though so I'm not complaining much. The food is decent. The service is not that great. Would go again, but only because there's no other Vietnamese place nearby."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,I love this place. The pho is good and they give you huge portions. The fried rice is yellow so thats wierd and the egg rolls are so so- there's something off about the dipping sauce. The spring rolls are good though. The owner is really friendly too. Check this place out its one of the better places in IV- if your in the mood for pho..
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I ordered an order of egg rolls and to go pineapple fried rice, by the time when I opened it. It stupidly didn't have any pineapple nor flavor in it ,and their egg roll wasn't not as good as it used to be. Not sure if I'm going to this place again."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I HIGHLY recommend this place. They make everything fresh themselves, the Pho broth, Thai tea, egg rolls, cream cheese wontons etc. They have really good prices too. For example, the sandwiches are huge and only cost $3.75. This is a great place to check out"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"When I went here, I ordered a #15. Pho Dac Biet: rice noodle soup with rare beef, beef brisket and beef meat balls ($8.95). For the price, it's a little expensive. While they do give you a decent amount, I'd recommend Noodle City, for something a little cheaper and a place that gives you more (see my Noodle City review!).

I will say, though, that their Thai tea with boba is great! It's a little pricey compared to other places, but it's good. I also hear that their Bahn Mi sandwiches are really good, so that might be something I go back for."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Wow, this place has gone down the drain. I used to actually like Pho Bistro because of their amazing noodle and fried rice dishes. After their re-opening due to management issues, the entire place has changed. The servers are still slow, but my regular order of the combo fried rice was disgusting. The rice was yellow and there were very few pieces of meat. It was so salty, I couldn't even finish half of it. 

The new chicken popcorn is not chicken popcorn. It's f*%king soggy chicken nuggets that's been frozen and breaded so badly, that you can't tell if you're eating toilet paper or food. 

Won't be coming back."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Worst pad Thai and ""white"" rice ever. The white rice I got is the same color as my ORANGE pad Thai"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"allright allright allright people,  we all know this is nothing compared to some LA pho. Broth kinda sorta really sucks but when you're hungover at 11am in the morning on a Sunday and Noodle City isn't open, this is your best bet. Add a nice swirl of that sriracha and you have some decent pho. Plus, there's plenty of other stuff on the menu that's worth your money. And the owners of this place are always so nice!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Went with a friend around 12pm for lunch. I got their #11 Pho Tai ($7.95)and their Thai tea with boba(around $2, I don't remember quite what the price was), friend got vegetarian fried rice($7.75). The place was a little claustrophobic, tables and counters were greasy. Mostly two and four seaters. Chair cushions punctured and not wiped. The pho broth was pretty watered down, a lot less flavour than there should have been, but all in all it was just the right amount of noodle for lunch. The beef wasn't anything special but it wasn't terrible. Distinct lack of bean sprouts. 

Friend's fried rice was unevenly salted. The portion was big enough that he couldn't finish; got take-away. According to him it was a little bland. From my end of the table, definitely did not look like it was worth 8 bucks. 

The Thai tea was actually quite good, but their boba was hard(undercooked, not old) and not sweet once bit into. Get your drinks without boba, or perhaps go later in the day so it's had more time to cook. It seems like they begin to cook the boba when they open up at midday, rather than cooking it during their prep time."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Well, noodles are our best friend when you are too lazy to cook or go anywhere else to for a dinner.

Their boba is quite tasteful."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I've never actually left a review on any place because it feels really mean but honestly I'm so poor and those $10 I spent were really a lot so I want to save everyone else from making the mistake I did. The name of the place is pho bistro, don't get the damn pad Thai. Literally do not do it. The name is PHO not Thai food, there unfortunately are very very limited options in the area so I was desperate but honestly just do not do it. I wanted authentic Thai not made by a lady named Sharon and...it was honestly the most disappointing and depressing pad Thai I've ever had. And I pretty much try to get pad Thai wherever I go. It was literally bright orange noodles with zero flavor and I feel so mean saying that because I work in food/service whatever (starbucks for over a year) and I get it, I know sometimes shit happens and the service was honestly great! Super nice, really friendly, food came out fast...it just sucked :( it was bright orange you guys what even is that, the chicken was...weird and scary, just had a bad taste, it didn't taste like pad Thai at all and I'm really bummed bc I can't even afford to be spending money like that and I should've just gone with their pho. I've had their pho before, that shit was hella dank I recommend that 100% the place is great their pad Thai just...I'm scarred tbh. Should've known better than to go for Thai at a place literally called pho bistro. Excuse me while I cry over the $10 down the drain (I couldn't finish it, honestly it just wasn't pad Thai the noodles literally looked like angel hair pasta I'm really upset and sad mostly sad because I feel like if I was a dish I would be that sad sorry excuse of pad Thai) anywho, their pho is great and they give you a good amount too. Don't get the pad Thai though. :-)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"After giving it a few more tries, I'm willing to give it a better review. I think the food is def. passable and the people that work there have also begun to warm up. ON Pardall, you can't expect much, but this is certainly passable in college town."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"When I have Asian food cravings this is the only place nearby that will satisfy them. I always get the vegetarian pho and its usually great. One time the soup was too salty and sometimes the veggies aren't too fresh, but the service is great and the taste is usually on point."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,This is awesome!!!!!!! I go to this spot every week. The Bon bu hue is so great!!!!!! I love it !!!!!!!!
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"At least 90% of pho places throughout SoCal are likely better than Pho Bistro. In hindsight, every time I ate here I thought it would have been better eating nearly anywhere else in IV. The pho soup is terrible:

- the broth lacks any dimension
- the sprout and veggie toppings are lacking and not fresh
- the meat is skimpy in portion too
- the meat choices are limited, with mostly a few types of tough meat as your only options. If you like less common cuts of meat like tripe and tendons you are out of luck here. The meatballs are the most flavorful option available.

As a UCSB student, I ate here a couple times out of desperation for pho, and I can now happily say I will never dine here again. 

One recent night I was craving pho and Pho Bistro was the only place still open in town, so I went on in. A waitress asked my party if we would like to dine in or order take out. We chose the latter and were promptly seated.

The same waitress came around again about five minutes later and asked if we knew what we wanted to order. I asked for a few more minutes, and eventually we placed our orders. Well, the girl came back from the kitchen asking if we minded ordering take out.

If you haven't tried it, to-go pho, in particular, is not very palatable, especially in large styrofoam cups. This place closed early and led us into thinking we could dine in. Being led on like this was very upsetting. This misleading service on top of terrible pho is why I'll never go back."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"The banh mi at Pho Bistro was huge and stuffed with grilled meat of your choice, cucumber, jalapeno, carrot, mayo, onion, tomato, and cilantro.  At under $4 each,  it makes a great meal for hungry students.  The grilled pork and beef had a sweet robust marinade and were more flavorful than the other Vietnamese places in town.  The downside was that the grilled meat had too much char.  A little char and smoke is great for flavor, but in this instance, there were several pieces of meat that I had to pick out because I didn't want to put that much polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in my body.

The cha gio was generously sized, but the filling had an unappetizing sour note.  I don't know if they purposely seasoned it that way or was it because the filling wasn't fresh.  The nouc mam was nicely concocted, not too watery, with a good balance of salty and sweet."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I don't understand how this place is rated as 1 $ in price. Dinner here will cost a single person about $20. I went alone last time and that's what my bill (including tip, probably) came out to. To get my fix of Viet food in IV, this is the place to go. But I've definitely experienced better and for cheaper."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I love the service of this place, they were very friendly. However, their food was kinda bland. It wasn't spicy and made me feel full but unfulfilled with what I ate. The place made me feel empty, although, the servers were kind I wasn't a huge fan of their food. I recommend other places for Vietnamese cuisine."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I gave this 5 stars just because I'm so excited that there's pho in IV, but I have since reviewed my rating because they close at 8 PM on saturday. What kind of restaurant does that? I'm from the bay area so I'm accustomed to much better pho for way less, but since I can't be there, this is really good for IV standards. It's perfect for a rainy day and you can't go wrong with the brisket pho. Last time I went I came around closing time and went next door to IV drip and when it was ready he brought it over to me. I think I'm going to have some pho tonight. Wish they delivered or let SB menus deliver though : /"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"4 stars mean Yay! I'm a fan, and I am. It has good, fresh, food at a IV price. 

I get #31, because a friend showed me it, it looked good and it taste."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Very disappointed with the chicken pad Thai. There just wasn't enough flavor. I've had a lot better elsewhere, but then again this is a Vietnamese food restaurant and not a Thai food restaurant. However, their pho soups are pretty good."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"This place is very small, but it's cute and really clean.  They're located in IV, but surprisingly make a good bowl of pho!  The pieces of beef are already cooked in the broth, which isn't how Pho Tai is supposed to be... but I'll let it slide because the beef is actually nice and tender.  If you don't live in IV, it's kind of an inconvenience to eat here because there's no parking (it IS Isla Vista, after all)."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I go to this place often because of how friendly the owner guy is, and the fact that there aren't very many asian food places in IV in the first place. Overpriced compared to Noodle City and Saigon, but the proximity to campus is worth the money. Pho is pretty decent, not the best but definitely good enough. Egg rolls are amazing. Waiters often lack in service, like bringing water, but it won't be a problem once you go there enough and they recognize your face."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Thought I would give IV pho a try myself after hearing all the horrible things about it, and most definitely those things are true. The Vietnamese coffee is horrible, straight horrible. I was hoping for some authentic Vietnamese food, but I was very disappointed. 
The staff however are very nice. Restaurant itself is very small."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Wow, really bland Pho and powder milk tea. 

However, the service is really nice but I do not think I'll go again."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,Would highly recommend this place for delicious lunch! Shrimp vermicelli was very tasty. Check out my experience on Picdish: http://picdish.com/experience/16779-59533
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Since it's Santa Barbara, Pho Bistro is alright. I had the vermicelli a while back and I just had a bowl of Pho (Dac Biet, or means special) recently. I think I had the beef vermicelli. I was a bit disappointed. There were a good portion of beef and vermicelli but there wasn't a lot variety of veggies. They only had lettuce. I was hoping for bean sprouts, cucumbers and more. It came with one eggroll. It was good but it wasn't enough. 

I'm from the Bay Area where there's Pho restaurants every 3-5 miles. The pho from the Pho Bistro was alright. The soup was kind of bland and needed more flavor and a bit more salt. I was wondering if they had those small sauce dishes. There was a good amount of bean spouts but there wasn't enough herbs like basil. I had a Thai Tea along with my pho. The Thai tea was good. :) The prices are a bit high but it's Santa Barbara afterall. I didn't expect a lot from this bistro. I just wanted to try it out. Overall, like I said since it's Santa Barbara, Pho Bistro is alright. :)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Not so vegetarian friendly. Their cream cheese wontons has crab in it and they tried to give me fish sauce.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,I came in on a Thursday night and has the best customer service!! Van and Jocelyne the two waitresses were working and were very attentive and helpful. I ordered cream cheese wontons and wings which were both very delicious and fresh!
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Great food, great service. Lovely family owned restaurant. There are so many options: Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and a bit of Japanese."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"As a pho connoisseur of sorts (my parents are from Vietnam), I have to say that Pho Bistro has the best pho in the Santa Barbara area.  I was pleasantly surprised when I got a huge steaming bowl with all the appropriate cuts of meat in it.  The broth has a deep beefy flavor (unlike all the other Vietnamese places in town that give you a bland broth) and will definitely quell any pho cravings you may have.  My only issue is that it was pretty pricey for a bowl of pho.  I think I paid about $8 for my bowl, which is way overpriced.  It should be under 6 bucks in my opinion, but then again I come from the Bay Area where prices for great Asian food are way lower."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I like coming here for lunch because it isn't as busy in the afternoon. Love the coconuts, decent price too. Can't say much about the pho, I don't eat that much, but the fried rice is good, and the servers are always friendly."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"My high rating is based only on their bahn mi sandwiches.  Their menu is quite overpriced as compared to Noodle City, but the best kept secret of this restaurant are their sandwiches. Such a great value! $4 for something that can fill me up in Isla Vista."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Have tried all the Pho's in the vicinity of IV and it's by far the best Pho!!! Try the wontons, your taste buds will love you."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I honestly have tried their Pho before, so this will be a two-item review. 

Part one: The Pho
- The Pho was decent, it wasn't what you would expect. The meat seemed a little rubbery, they put way too much MSG in the soup so much so that I literally had to chug ice water. The customer service was stellar, seeing as college students work here. In all, I was sort of disappointed at the quality of the meal.

Part two: The Bun Bo Hue
- The Bun Bo Hue DEFINITELY does not look like your standard one. For one thing, they use Thin vermicelli, instead of the big, thick Vermicelli. Second, the meat looked like it came from a Pho bowl, lighter than what you would expect. Thirdly, the greens looked a little old, especially the lemon slice I was provided with. Fourth, the slices of peppered... I don't know what they are... they are like pieces of rubber. I do have to give them chops for the soup. The soup is very authentic, typical to what you get in Little Saigon.


Overall:
I'm not going to recommend this place, but I'm not going to encourage people to stay away from this place. For some things, it does better, but for these types of main cuisine. They could improve. Sure, the 10% off with cash is nice, but I would not mind a modest price increase to be served what I expect, with better ingredients. I'm part Vietnamese, so I grew up eating this, so it's not quite up to par as I hoped it to be."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I love their Bahn Mi sandwiches.  The veggies in the sandwich can be a little more pickled but I think they use a better meat then most Vietnamese places.  Also, I highly recommend their thai iced tea.  They don't use the nasty powder stuff and instead they freshly brew the tea."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,One of my favorite places to eat in IV during my undergrad! The pho is always good and their customer service is excellent. The lady who works there is friendly and even remembered my usual order. I will definitely be stopping by the next time I'm in the Santa Barbara area.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Ordered:
Combination Fried Rice (Beef, Chicken , Shrimp)
- Cleaned the plate, good flavor for fried rice dish, good meat portion
Vegetarian Lo Mein
- Substantial amount of vegetables, slightly oily but tasty and satisfying
Ambiance:
-Warm, noise level average
Service:
-Super fast, got food within 10 minutes"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"My friends and I got the rice combinations and while the meat was tasty, the rice was an odd cheddar yellow color that (surprisingly due to it's outstanding color) tasted like normal white rice. So odd."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I gave four stars( more like a 3.5 star) because I think the food is really a bomb, especially the vermicelli and Pho noodle soup( such as # 15, 17 and 24). The only downside is that the place is too small, and compact. There is not that much room for people to come in and sit."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I come here often out of desperation for some Asian food but if you can, I suggest you go to Noodle City or Pattaya. 

Don't Togo. You'll get more dining in.
Food is overpriced and check the bill often before paying. Don't buy the drinks unless it's Thai tea. You'll just be paying a lot for disappointment. Chow fun dishes are no fun. Pho is decent. Pad Thai is eh. 

Service is nice by the student workers but not from the owner."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"This place is ok. I'd never had Pho before so that through me off a bit, and I had to add quite a bit of sauces to spice it up, but not bad."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"How this place stays in business is baffling, even with its location. The food was disgusting and way overpriced. I managed a few bites before throwing it away and just writing off my $10. Spend your money elsewhere."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"So it's pretty regular as pho goes. I enjoyed the spring rolls cuz it had a lot of mushroom in it. I had the well done beef pho and the meat was a bit thick. otherwise, the broth was on the bland side, but the meal wasn't offensive."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I always feel so conflicted when I write a review for a place with a really friendly waiter. The guy that I have often seen working here is very friendly and very attentive. The food quality here is what cause my internal conflict. I ordered the ban mi sandwich combo (it comes with any drink on their milk tea menu or a fountain drink). They offer chicken, pork, and beef. I opted for the chicken. One of the parts of a ban mi that can make or break it the most if the french roll; in this case they used day-old bread (at least a day, probably more) it was hard from age, not from being toasted. The chicken was really (visibly) dry and probably reheated. The toppings were on the older side, with the jalapeño being visibly dry from being sliced likely days ahead of time. I ended up having to bathe the meat in sriracha, hoisin, and chili paste since it didn't have much of a flavor of its own. I got the taro milk tea; it was decent but grainy at the end. They finally got better lychee jelly with a more pleasant texture than what they used to sell so I was glad about that. My partner got the pho and it contained an assortment of noticeably bad cuts of meat (when was served the tough, inedible type of tendons that showed their meat was clearly not trimmed). They also served her basil that was soggy and brown, literally expired already. On top of it all, their pho is overpriced, a small bowl, and the broth is very bland. The broth should be the most important focus and they neglected making it taste like something. You can get a larger bowl of better pho at any of the pho restaurants in the goleta area (I've tried them all multiple times each to make sure) Overall don't recommend this place."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"fastest, most delicious pho i've had in a long time. super great service, the waiter even explained the differences on the menu to us and offered his recommendations. The milk tea was really good too! They even came by halfway through our email and gave us more broth for our pho. Ramen was good, but i'd recommend the spicy soup. Great place to go on a rainy day :)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"My boyfriend and I stopped here for some boba. We ordered together but got separate tabs because they didn't hear me when I said it was going to be on the same tab. It was whatever, so we paid and waited. I ordered a taro smoothie and my bf ordered a regular Thai tea w/boba. After waiting for a good 10 mins, they came out with a Taro tea instead of smoothie. I went back inside and told them I ordered a smoothie and the employee in the front gave me a confused face. Another employee came, I think it was the owner, I told him and he said they will make it after showing him the receipt. 5 mins it came out, it was half smoothie and half tea, and it was so powdery! I could taste and see the clumps of taro powder and cream. So freaken disappointed. Everything is overpriced too. Horrible service. Don't ever eat here!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Since its the only pho place in iv..might as well..pretty good for a rainy evening..cmon, experiment a lil!! enuff with the burritos!!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Ordered a smoothie and it had huge chunks of ice in it making it almost un drinkable, would not recommend"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I like it as a little place in college town to get Asian food, but I still have a hard time giving this place more than three stars. My latest rant is that it lacks class. For example, tables are taped with packing tape, and the chairs in the place don't match. If they class it up, I could bump this up to 4 stars."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I don't know why people are so hard on Pho Bistro. I have eaten here probably 10 times and never gotten food poisoning or diarrhea (which is more than I can say for Caje). I alway get the raw beef and meatballs (which admittedly look a little grey but they are delicious). If you are recalling craving hot beef soup, look no further than Pho Bistro."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I've not had too much Vietnamese food, so maybe I'm not the best judge here, but their food is pretty tasty.

Unfortunately there is only one veggie dish on the menu: rice noodle veggie stir fry with mushrooms, chopped up spring rolls and tofu, but it is really good.  They also give you a ton of food and are always super nice.  Like I said, I wish they had more veggie options, but I do enjoy what I've had!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"This review is based mainly on the Pho, I haven't really tried the other items on the menu.

Having grown up around a lot of Pho restaurants back in Orange County I think I am pretty picky when it comes to Pho, but Pho Bistro really satisfies my cravings. This place has a bunch of lower reviews, but most of those are from '09. This place has really improved from when it tried  it back then too. The noodles used to have a stale taste to me and the soup seemed bland in the past, however this year I have gone so many times, and none have failed to disappoint. Most of the newer reviews seem be positive, except for a few that don't make sense to me. 

Pros: 
Taste- After trying Saigon Noodle and Noodle City, I think Pho Bistro has the best broth of the 3. This to me is a pretty big deal, since Pho is all about the broth. It's much heartier then the other restaurants and you can see it for yourself, the soup just looks dense and taste heartier while the other places broths are just clear and much lighter tasting. When it comes to taste, this place beats out the others easily. 

Location - It's right in ""The Loop"", so if you live in the Isla Vista area you can just bike/walk/skate there in a matter of minutes. Great for college students in the area. 

Setting- The people working here are always nice. Usually it's just one person working, but every time I've eaten there I've had good service. It's a small place with a few tables, but it's always clean. 

Takeout - Since it's a small place I usually prefer to just go pick up some food and eat in the comfort of my house. They always package everything really nice so it doesn't fall out or spill everywhere, and I've never had to wait more then 10 minutes to get my order, if anything it's usually around 5 minutes.

Tase - Tastiest PHO in Goleta.

Cons:
Price - It's IV so you can't expect too much of a good deal I suppose. It's rather pricey compared to the cheaper prices/larger portions you get at the other pho restaurants in the area (definitely doesn't compare to the $3.00 bowls you can get in Westminster). 

Portion Size - There's only one size and I find it pretty small. The bowls could have more noodles and meat. I can take down the whole bowl including all the soup pretty easily. I really think they should consider offering a larger size,. 

No Tripe - I know it's catered to a broader crowd, but I feel as though there are enough people in the community in Isla Vista that would appreciate tripe with their Pho and wouldn't be grossed out by it. I feel as though Tripe and Pho kind of belong together. Don't really know many Vietnamese restaurants that don't have tripe at all. 

Setting- I wouldn't come here with a party greater then 4, it's going to get cramped real quick. It wont be fun for your party or the people working."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Service was great, menu was priced right, food was amazing and the portions were generous.  I'll definitely be back!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"WHAT THE EFF HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE.

I used to go here so often, cause their cooking was decent/good. There aren't that many other Asian places to go to. They started expanding their menus, and gaining more customers while the quality of everything was going down. Some of the new items are good, especially the ones in the separate Chinese menu.

Once they got a bit more busy though, they couldn't keep up. The employees there suck. They're so disorganized and forgetful, I wondered if they even knew what they were doing. Now, every time I go there I always think ""I could do a better job than this."" My friend and I waited 40-50 minutes for ONE of my orders to arrive, 25-30 minutes of that time in which I had no water even though I asked. When we finally got the food though, the fried rice wasn't even fried rice. We sent it back and asked for a new one cause we thought it wasn't fried enough. That wasn't the problem. The rice wasn't cooked properly. It was overcooked with too much water, making it lumpy and mushy. We were so disappointed we ended up eating less than half of it and didn't take it to go. 

When we were ordering, we decided to go out of our comfort zone and try their recently added popcorn chicken for $6. Damn, did we regret it. Popcorn chicken is supposed to be crunchy. I thought I was eating microwaved, then deep-fried frozen Dino nuggets. Also, who charges $4 for fries? There's a Habit across the street.

I could go on and on about my disappointments that have been accumulating since my initial experiences with this place. I'm just gonna stick to their pho and egg rolls from now on."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I love this place!

I come here all the time, especially when I'm craving Asian comfort food. I usually get Pho 17 or the #42 rice/meat, and they're both great. The lady who serves me is always nice and attentive, and one of the main reasons I always return is because of her great service. 

The Pho they serve here is almost $10 and comes in one size only. I love the shape of the bowls that they serve it in (large and deep), but it's too much to eat in one sitting. It usually takes me two meals to finish it, so I would suggest asking them to split it into two orders (half ""for here"" and the other half ""to go"") if you decide to dine in. I do recommend eating in because the place emits a homey feel.

For coffee drinkers out there, try the Vietnamese coffee. It'll blow your mind away. If there was such a thing as a rugged (bittersweet) taste, that's how Vietnamese coffee will taste like on your palate. They also have boba!

And in my opinion, this place is way better than the Saigon Noodle/Pho place next to KMart."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I love the Vietnamese coffee, so fresh. Spring rolls are equally good and the fried rice is perfect. However, the place is a little dirty and poorly decorated. Also, the bathroom is in the back so as you're making your way through the kitchen you can see some poor hygeine habits. The outside seating is nice though."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,The fried rice and pho are really delicious. The people who work there are also nice.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Came here to recover after Deltopia. The service and food were on point, even though this place gets a bad rep as people claim that it isn't authentic Vietnamese food, I would have to disagree (seeing that the cook was Vietnamese.) Living in IV means rarely being able to find authentic Asian food so if the drive to Noodle City is too far, try out Pho Bistro!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"doesnt taste good... =/ overpriced 9 dollars small portions pho hahah

small place

I asked for my rare thinly sliced beef on the side
It said it came with it on the menu

I ordered in vietnamese but had to use english for them =D no problem hah
She came back later and said the cook said it doesnt come with rare thin beef

I said its on the menu, and i can read the vietnamese XD
She said no..

I said forget it just cancel it.
She came back and gave me the meat and was like, ""Do you still want it?!""

I said fk yes!
should have said no, it wasnt good. Im pretty sad that I have to stay here for school another few years and theres nothing good to eat around here. ;_;"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Had the lemongrass beef over vermicelli.  Presentation was solid, but there was something off about the dish..the sprouts were old and had a funky taste.  Service is cool, the guy is friendly."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,As a restaurant who serves pho I would've expected them to have a good supply of sprouts but nope. They were completely out which I don't understand; they're one of the very few items to put in your pho. Disappointed. Also the basil and cilantro they were able to give me were brown and not fresh.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,Rare Vietnamese place in Santa Barbara that is good for vegetarians. The vegetarian pho was great! Thanks!
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Gave this place a try and wasn't pleased.  It's nothing compared to many of the pho places in LA.  My friend and I got the beef pho bowl and it just didn't have the flavor there.  The broth tasted like water.. The people working there was friendly, but the food just wasn't there for me."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! 
After looking at the other stores nearby, all the other places seemed to be expensive, for mediocre food. I can get pizza, sandwiches, and all that other stuff other places. But good pho in IV? Only this place! The wife and husband were really nice, sat down immediately, got our drinks and ordered our food just like that. Ordered the Thai Ice Tea and that was really good, some days they even make boba so make sure you ask when they do cause it makes your drink that much better. I ordered the Pho Tai, It came in a huge bowl, lots of beansprouts/veggies/limes. The meat was good, noodles and veggies were fresh, and the broth was perfect. If your not into Pho, They have a bunch of rice dishes, noodle dishes, they even have fried rice and salads! The Banh Mi sandwich looked really good and cheap, so I will definitely have to try that the next time.

Its a small place, but can't get better vietnamese food anywhere else!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"AMAZING and authentic Vietnamese food... Great service and convenient location... Prices are great and food amazing!!! Try the pork ribs... Juicy and tender!! ""Great delivery service... Food to die for!!!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I tried their pineapple fried rice and it ruined pineapple fried Rices for me. there's no flavor, tasted so bland. It's like they put some really gross rice and mixed it w more gross chicken( also bland). Usually pineapple fried Rice's come with nuts & raisins which they didnt have. I threw the whole thing away after taking maybe 2 bites bc it was that bad."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Pho Bistro used to be somewhat decent until they remodeled and got new management (and new chefs, presumably). The dishes make no sense and almost half the time I went there I ended up with the wrong thing. 

The noodles are served cold and lifeless, and there's not enough sauce on them, EVER.  There's always a friggin MOUNTAIN of bean sprouts heaped on the plate posing as noodles. You're not fooling anyone, Pho Bistro. We know those aren't noodles.

Even when this place was tolerable it still wasn't great, and I only went there because it was close to my apartment. As with every food-joint in the hellhole of Isla Vista, it's incredibly overpriced -- you'll spend at least $10 for a meager meal which is almost guaranteed to be half bean sprouts. 

Never eating here again. I won't miss it."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"my wife and i just discovered this pho restaurant when we were visiting Santa Barbara  
the pho noodle soup was surprising good because i was a little skeptical when i saw the bad reviews.  my wife got the fried shrimp rolls and they were very crunchy and tasty! our drinks were also delicious, we got a thai tea and a milk tea. we will definitely come back here whenever we are in town!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I was craving chicken pad thai and it was the closest place that served it so I ordered take out over the phone. When I came in I had to wait like 5-10 min to pay for my meal because the cashier was on the phone, possibly taking an order, which was really nerve-wracking because I was on my way to work. The pad thai alone was extremely dissatisfying so I added the hot sauce and lemon which made it taste 10x better, but the chicken still lacked a lot of flavor and the noodles resembled angel hair noodles as opposed to the normal stir fry rice noodles. I have also tried the beef pho and the meat was pretty gross, but the soup itself was okay. The thai tea boba was probably the best thing I had, but it was still not the best. Also, they have their straws in a bin without the wrapper, so I do not think that is very sanitary."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"It's alright 
The boba is half the time good half the Time not good
The pho on the other hand is pretty good. Tip! Don't order it to go or for delivery because they give less and it's mostly water 
However when you eat there, they give SOOOOO MUCH FOOD! It'll be hard to stay hungry after
Good if you want some non canned soup and stuff"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Very yummy pho place! My girlfriend had the vegetable pho and was expecting it to be bland but she really enjoyed it. I had the meatball and sliced beef pho and it was good as well. The waiter was also nice, definitely recommend this place."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,It's super oily! And also the entire place smells bad. The service is good though. I don't recommend t be honest
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Judged strictly on their pho absolutely terrible. Broth is the worst pho broth I have ever tasted, they even found a way to phock it up with shitty low quality noodles, and then they have the audacity to serve imitation crab in their crab pho without disclosing it as such. Also very overpriced."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Yes, their vietnamese food is pretty decent - it's enough to satisfy your cravings for Vietnamese food. However, their prices are very high. I can order Pho for $5 in OC but here, it's nearly double that.

Their spring rolls and won ton cheesecake are delicious."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Well from a vietnamese place in Isla vista, my expectations were not really high.

They have a wide range of boba and various milk tea drinks that are alright, I like their thai tea. One thing that I regret is that their fried rice is literally disgusting. Very oily & greasy, as well as their chicken that honestly tastes bad. I have also tried the noodles over there, not very impressed either.

They tend to open and close at random times of the day. Also, one very important point is that you cannot eat at this place on a hot day, you have to take to go, unless you want to feel a very dusty fan on your head in the small and hot restaurant.

Not a terrible place, you just have to be smart regarding what kind of food you choose and where you want to eat it."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Honestly its a blessing in disguise not to have good pho in IV otherwise I wouldn't have any money... go to noodle city

~~ I heard their springrolls are good so maybe some things are hit or miss but the pho is a miss"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Food and drinks are decently good. I got the Vermecelli and my boyfriend got the pork fried rice ! I also got the Thai tea which was not as sweet as Hana kitchen and had its own good flavor. The fried rice flavor is also bomb! I would come back if I'm craving Chinese food. Just not the cleanest place but will do in IV...
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I'm somewhat new to SB, so when I heard about a Pho place in a town that is mostly White, I was a bit hesitant. But regardless, a friend and I went there for lunch because we wanted something Asian. We walk in and it seems nice enough: relax feel, quiet sitting and friendly staff. 

The waiter came to take our order and we both ordered the regular Pho with some sort of beef. I didn't see any tripe (which I am a huge fan of) so I asked if they had any. The waiter said they took it off the menu because it didn't sell well. Our silence slowly turned into a smirk- we both knew what we were thinking. White people don't like tripe.

So other than the fact that they don't have some essentials due to some supply and demand, the Pho wasn't half bad. I've had better but what do you expect? It's a Pho shop in a White town."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"The food, decent; the service, poor: the owner or the manager."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"My Rating of Pho Bistro is ""Meh. I've experienced better.""."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Came here strictly for the boba drinks.

I was tired of the super sweetness of Hana Kitchen's drinks and the slow service at Naan Stop, so I decided to try Pho Bistro for their boba. They have such a wide selection of drinks but I always judge a boba place based on my go to flavor - taro milk tea with boba. 

Ordered and got my drink within five minutes. Overall, it was very good by IV standards! Taro milk tea was okay, not much special. The boba was great! Sweet and was a great consistency. Four stars because it wasn't terrible and I have a new place to get decent boba in an otherwise boba-less town. Will be back more often!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Pho bistro has gotten significantly better since they changed owners. Their beef chow fun is BOMB and their pho is debatably more flavorful than the pho from noodle city. You should definitely check this place out, it's way better than before!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I'm not a Vietnamese food expert, but I've had a fair amount of it growing up in Garden Grove. The first time I had a bowl of pho here it felt a little off and I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. After ordering it again I've decided that I don't care for it much here. I've had much better broth and I'd rather not eat pho here unless I'm desperately craving some. 

I agree with the previous reviewers about the Bahn Mi sandwiches, they're good...especially considering this is Isla Vista. Also, the price is great and the sandwich has a good amount of meat.

Their grilled pork is good here, so any dish that has it I would recommend. Also, their egg rolls are great... different than egg rolls at other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to...in a good way. Their thai iced tea is also good.

Like I said, I don't know how authentic this place is since I'm not Viet...but it's my favorite place to eat in Isla Vista. Vietnamese and Asian cuisine in general is comfort food for me so I'll eat here over Freebirds any day. And to top it off the owner is nice."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Overpriced and skimpy portions. If you can, catch a bus and opt for the one in dt Goleta. It's worth the trip."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Really love their noodle dish with Chicken, forget what it's called, but it's very good. Their spring rolls are fucking amazing too. 

This is the best place to go on a cold foggy night. The dude who usually runs it (has some tattoos) is pretty nice as well."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,Honestly the best food I've had in IV. They have huge portions and it is delicious! Its a gem around here haha
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"A lot of people told me the pho place in IV sucks. But it's actually better than all the other pho places in the area, in food and in service. The store recently changed owner, so all the reviews from around 09 and 10 doesnt really apply. Give it a try. Pho is great for hangovers

The combo fried rice there is pretty good too."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"This pho place wasn't always this good. They recently underwent some management/menu changes, and it's really awesome. The pho is average. Decent noodles, decent broth. However, the new menu additions are really something. BBQ pork chops or beef on rice with veggies are good. 
The reason this place gets 4 starts instead of the 3 it realistically deserves is solely because of their Banh Mi (with BBQ Pork)! For $3.50 (yes $3.50) you get a 9-10 inch sandwich on fresh baguette with hot BBQ pork and crisp delicious veggies. Absolutely to die for and the price is so great."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Honestly this places costumer service is bomb. I really like there food, and every time i've gone there i've had a great experience."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Gaucho Pho

Our daughter, who goes to UCSB, introduced her parents to a local Vietnamese restaurant in ""I.V."" [Isla Vista] during Spring Break.   It's a family owned restaurant with limited indoor and outdoor seating.  If you want to support a small business that employs Gauchos, you'd be pleased to know that our friendly and attentive server was also a current UCSB student.
  
I tried their Banh Mi Bo [Beef Sandwich] and was pleasantly surprised about how good it was and its reasonable price.  It was listed as # 8 on their menu for $4.25.  [Compare that to nearby ""Subway's"" $5 foot longs, which are now $6].  If you want one of their fancy drink concoctions, then opt for their ""sandwich combo"" for about $3 more and it's included.  [You'll save a few dollars by not going ala carte.]  The grilled beef tasted like ""boneless"" - Korean bbq style short ribs and there was plenty of it.  It's served on a French roll with typical Vietnamese veggies.  Beware of the sliced [jalapeno?] pepper in the mix, because it gives the sandwich some kick, if you prefer milder fare.  I enjoyed it very much and would order it again.

My wife and daughter had their Pho which was OK, but a bit pricey.  But, when you're over a hundred miles away from home, your alternatives are few, due to the lack of competition, and your mode of transportation being just your feet.

Perhaps, if Pho Bistro doesn't already do this, it should consider giving a ""Student Discount"" to patrons that show their UCSB ID card or offer a ""freebie"" to repeat customers, after so many meals are purchased to reward their loyalty."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Chucky was super helpful in picking what I wanted to order, seeing as how I've never been here. He made some good recommendations and I ended up getting the ribs with fried rice which were super big and really good. Can't wait to try more from this place!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I got the grilled pork plate and it was delicious. Slightly overpriced, but so are most things in IV. The portion is large and the meat is super tasty. I also got peach green tea with boba and lychee jelly, which was the best boba I've had in IV so far. I would recommend this place for your Vietnamese cravings!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"If you are reading ANY of the reviews here and still are thinking of going, then just go. You deserve the pain. Dear owner, get your damn act together, or just leave. You own a restaurant for gods sake, and are lucky that your ""bistro"" hasn't already been legally shut down."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"If you know what you want, you gonna get the best quality asian food around here with chef Lee back in the kitchengood variety as well"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Pho Bistro was easy to find and seating was pretty easy. The inside is small except there are outside seats as well. I would say sitting outside would be nicer, so you could watch the IV hustle and bustle. 

Pho Bistro has ALOT of different drinks! I'm tempted to try some but then I heard that basically all their drinks are 4.95! That's a little too expensive for my tastes, especially as a broke college student. Guess I'll have to try them next time! Seems like you can pretty much mix anything with whatever tea you want, or make it into an icy or smoothie. 

My friends and I ordered egg rolls to share. They were decent, don't really know what else to say about it. Was definitely not the best I've had from a pho restaurant though.

I always pho with rare steak. Pho Bistro doesn't give that many pieces of steak....about 6 pieces. Maybe it's because back home, most of the Pho places I went to always gave more steak if it was the only meat I ordered. And especially because Pho Bistro is EXPENSIVE! $9.25 for my bowl of pho with 6 pieces of steak?!?! I'm a broke college student!! The soup did not taste bad, it was pretty decent though. 

Have nothing else to say about it actually except that if it was cheaper, I would definitely be coming back! Next time, I'll probably try a different pho place...hopefully they give me some more meat for the price I pay!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Bit pricey but great tasting food and excellent customer service! Order their fried rice, bun bo hue, short ribs rice, or BBQ pork sandwich. I also like their passion fruit tea with popping boba. Sweet 10% discount if you pay with cash...convenient location close to three different banks if you want to grab cash. I think this place definitely needs an upgrade though."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"My husband & I are in town on the last night of our honeymoons and craving Asian. The first place we ordered on Doordash cancelled on us, so this was runner up. We eat pad Thai pretty regularly, and this is awful. I don't know how this place stays in business around here. The cream cheese wontons were terrible too. Extremely disappointed with our order. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Ordered this place on DoorDash and got the beef pho. It came with almost clear, bland and pure oily broth, four small pieces of meat, sticky gross noodles, and none of the sprouts, lime, cilantro etc. Got my tonsils out and was really looking forward to this and didn't get what I ordered and oily bland pho."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,the worst pad thai i ever have! the meat is not fresh and the taste is bad
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,I usually order the ramen and it always tastes marvelous! The folks who own the place are also very sweet! Definitely recommend when you're in IV.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Well tonight I ordered takes from the pho bistro only because I am very sick and in need of some warm broth to fill me up. Anyways I chose the chicken ramen which probably was a bad choice considering this is a pho shop, anyways I open it up and right away the quality is a somewhat middle class version of microwave top ramen. Coming from San Diego and eating at very good ramen houses this was slightly appalling. It was $10 for a bowl of shitty noodles covered in random vegetables and a minimal amount of tough chicken slices.  It was fine with me because I was on the verge of tears from hunger and the ordering was convenient but on a typical night where I'm not half unconscious in bed I would never ever eat here, the prices are ridiculous for the quality. Very disappointed at the food selection in Santa Barbara and Goleta for Asian food."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I was going to give it 4 stars but read the other reviews and thought.. oh yeah, I thought the same thing.  Areas they are lacking: 8 bucks for a bowl of Pho?  Ridonkulous! No little bowls to mix up your Srirachia and plum sauce, no sugar at the table, not a variety of Pho choices, and they served my pho with 1 sprig of basil and 1 sprig of cilantro.. and very little bean sprout.  Additionally, they don't have spring rolls--I've never been to a Pho joint and been denied rolls... it just isn't the same if you can't have spring rolls with your soup.  

As for service: once again, not a place where people smile but, if you're lucky, the cute Asian girl will be working.  She puts the radio on and smiles like the Dickens, and i like that a lot.  A smile goes a long way when you're surrounded by sour pusses all day."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"How has this place not been shut down, honestly hoping my stomach is ok after making the mistake of going here. I've eaten vietnamese food in LA and SF - and I'm not sure what I ate, but it did not make me feel good. 

The banh mi here is one part stale bread, cilantro leaf, old tomato, two spoons of miracle whip, and topped off with a dash of depression.

The waitresses are nice tho!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Service quite all right , Food below average , Owner Suck !!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Really good pho, and the pork fried rice is delicious. I ordered off of postmates and the order was missing a soup. I called in and they were very helpful. The manager came and delivered the soup to me! Very good restaurant."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"seems to have gotten worse lately, was served very old n hard crispy chicken pieces in their cheap pho baguettes.
Also got some cold shrimp served that were supposed to be deep-fried :/ They re-fried them so they got chewy and crispy, almost burnt. Not very delicious..."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,Amazing boba smoothies! I always go here for all my abg needs. Place is cute and cozy. Boba is always the perfect consistency and just the right amount of sweet.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"No idea this gem was tucked away in IV, such good phó! Reasonable prices & they give a 10% discount if you pay with cash (not sure if that's an all-time thing). Either way, the staff are nice and hospitable. Quick service! Pho Tai (rare sliced beef) & Thai tea w/ boba highly recommended! Use the sauces on the table, you won't regret it."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I really wanted to like this place, but it all started off bad when I walked in 10 minutes before close and they asked me, ""for here or to go?"" Then when I replied ""for here,"" they said ""Sorry we're closing in 5 minutes.""  In my head I couldnt stop myself from thinking, then why the heck did you ask?!  But of course I held my tongue because I didn't want to piss off the person preparing my food. 

Anyways- I ordered just the standard beef pho. Got home and I was pleased to see that everything was packed neat and in separate bags and containers. I dumped everything out into a large bowl. I thought that this would be good enough to satisfy my late night pho craving. However, the more bites I took, it was hard to ignore how GREASY the broth was. I can still feel the grease on my lips.  I was actually quite amused watching the grease in the broth separate and come together.  Aside from the grease, there was no flavor either. Definitely not coming back."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Ate here with my family several months back when visiting Santa Barbara. The pho broth was plain. We also ordered eggrolls and the meat was bad. The service was ok, so the 2 stars."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,First time I tried the food was during the summer quarter. I sensed that the lack of business resulted in a lower quality of the food. It took me a while to want to try it again but the last three times I have gone I have been very impressed. Delicious broth and fresh protein. I would definitely feel confident recommending their food to others now that I have had multiple good experiences!
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I am speaking on behalf of a to-go chicken pho I ordered. The chicken was such poor quality, I ended up scooping it out of the pho. It was really chewy, and the other look and taste of it was...off. After eating one piece, I decided it wasn't worth it to eat all of the pieces. I do not want to eat poor quality meat. 
I ALWAYS regret my decision from ordering from this place. Save your money or go to other pho spots. Don't get it delivered even if you really want pho but don't want to drive some where else!!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Food 3/5
Service: Doordashed it so 5/5

It's okay, but I've definitely had better. I was surprised when my bun bo hue came without lime, bean sprouts, or anything. Just lettuce LMAO."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Went there for chicken pho. It smelled very foul, was cut in chunks(instead of sliced) and had a bad texture. When I asked why they said the chicken was ""freshly cooked the previous day"". What restaurant would do that?"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"This place make the best spring rolls and egg rolls the price is decent too, and it's walking distance from ucsb!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Terrible chicken Chowmein/ chow fun. Got chicken fat and no chicken pieces in the food. The owner should not have served the dish if they didn't have enough ingredients.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Being 100% fresh off the boat from Vietnam, I didn't expect much from this place at all compared to the authentic dishes in my home country. But come on, we're in SANTA BARBARA guys, so cut these people some slack. The most authentic Pho you can find in the states would be located in California cities of Garden Grove, Westminster, or San Jose. The cooks are Vietnamese, so it made me feel sort of at home when I hear them talk in Vietnamese in the kitchen. I felt pretty alone in Santa Barbara due to the lack of people from Vietnam, until I came here. 
 
Now about the food, it's quite delicious! HUGE drink selection! I definitely recommend the taro, mixed berry, marcha, or banana smoothie! But honestly....all of the smoothies are amazing. If you upgrade to a milkshake it comes with ice cream!! I had the Combination Pho and it was pretty decent! $10 is what's expected in Isla Vista...taking in consideration the owner has to go a long way to get the necessary resources since Santa Barbara literally has no good asian market. The bowl was filling. However, if you want to order a large, go for it! That portion is amazingly generous!!  ***For all you chili lovers, ask for chili paste to go with your soup!!*** trust me it makes a huge difference.

Also, the cups they use for water is so VIETNAMESE it made so happy lol!

The girls working there are super cute haha, but I also wish they hired a waitress who spoke Vietnamese as well (like me )!

I'll be coming back to try the Bun Bo Hue and Bap Xao. Will keep updating this review.

UPDATE: they ran out of Bap Xao but no biggie I tried their Bun Bo Hue and I'd recommend this for everyone! I actually prefer this over their Pho. If you're on a quick run and need a cheap meal to go get their Banh Mi special. They have fresh coconut here to drink right out of the fruit. Very nostalgic :)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I am soo disappointed, I've gotten the pad thai here before and i remember it being decent but today it was literally the worst thing ever!! i ordered chicken pad thai and pork spring rolls.

the pad thai had all the color of pad thai but didn't have any flavor, the onions were raw, the chicken was bland as fuuuck, ON TOP of all that, they were using the PHO NOODLES for PAD THAI???? i was literally so confused like if you're out of pad thai noodles then don't sell pad thai... 

also received shrimp spring rolls instead of what i ordered.. literally never coming back"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Hey guys LISTEN UP. I worked at this Pho place for about 5 months or so. It's definitely not the cleanest restaurant and the food is alright but I do recommend a few dishes that I think are actually really good. The fried rice is definitely good. Just the shrimp one though cause I think the other meats used in the the fried rice are bland. THE PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS ARE BOMB. Sure its a little pricey but its reallyyyy good. The chowfun is bomb too btw so get that. The eggrolls are decent and so are the spring rolls. The drinks are good when I MAKE THEM FOR SURE. I got that ingredient ratio on point my friends. I actually ate here a lot even though I worked here because I love pho and it was the only decent pho place in the area besides Noodle City. Also 50% off so woohooo. When I first came here I thought it was like really bad pho but then I got used to it and I think it started tasting better and better LOLLL. Obviously its not the best pho around but its decent and id still eat here like 3 times a week cause thats how much I love pho.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Servers are terrible, they were upset when I asked for an extra bowl. food was terrible! I ordered a sandwich, the baguette was too old, and hard like a stone, the meat was smelly for some reason.Never come back.  I give it 1 stars, but i think they are worth only no star if there was an option."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Ordered to go here for the first time and was happy with my order. I got the red beef pho and it was good and it was packaged great (broth and noodles separate) they gave me so many noodles that I couldn't even finish it lol (but it's good bc I like noodles) food was quick, lady working was nice. Only downside was the bean sprouts weren't really fresh and there wasn't too much meat. However will come again when I'm craving pho :)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Fresh Vietnamese food!
I really loved their noodles, eating the noodles with some juicy beef right there from a bowl is the freshest food in all IV if you ask me.
The meals are pretty affordable, and a take away bowl takes only around 10 minutes! Amazing!
Only minor drawback, there is not too many tables in there, so it could be hard to find a table during some times of the day."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"aesthetics: 1/5
food: 1/5
service: 3/5

i'm a very picky eater, but the one dish that usually doesn't fail me is tofu pad thai.

my friend and i were craving noodles the other night and decided to try pho bistro, despite seeing the low rating. however, when i ordered the pad thai from pho bistro, it was so disgusting. the order came out a bit too fast...i usually wait for 10-15 minutes, but this pad thai was already out, just minutes after ordering? 
after my 1st bite, i was done with my meal. i've never seen pad thai looking like a sickly orange - honestly, i could have mistaken the noodles for carrots. the food had no flavor at all; even though i added so much sauce, the food was very bleh-tasting. 

overall, do NOT come here if you want to waste 13 dollars on a nasty, unauthentic asian meal. go to empty bowl or tap thai if you want high-quality tasting pad thai instead!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,2 stars for the service. Pho is not good enough to me and the restaurant doesn't seem very clean.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I go there at least twice a week. Their noodles are very Q, thai iced tea+boba's really good and customer service's great. Jeff, the guy who used to own pho bistro, is awesome. ..gave me relationship advice and discounts haha ^.^ 

Definitely check out this place and say hi to mr. lee :D

On thurs-saturday they open till 2am so it's a great place to go after partying/during beer runs. 

Oh and I saw steve aoki there last year lol."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"bad food. not just the taste but quality. very dirty kitchen. for health reasons, i will never ever come back here."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,This shit tasted like my exs Ass hole and the after taste has been lingering in my mouth for over an hour now . I would suggest going somewhere else or maybe drinking mud water instead of the broth. Maybe dig up some worms to eat instead of the noodles
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I don't get the people who say that it's authentic Vietnamese food, like, have you ever had true Vietnamese food??  Because this place is definitely not authentic.  

My parents and I tried three different items on their menu: pho dac biet, bun thit nuong, and cha gio.  The pho and bun were bland and frugal; the nuoc mam was not the sweet nuoc you typically have with this type of bun; and the meats were strangely colored.  And the cha gio wasn't very good, there was very little meat and it was dry.

If you want a good pho/bun place, Saigon Noodle House makes much, much better food; the only disappointing is in the lack of herbs, but it's expected with opening a Vietnamese restaurant with no Vietnamese market nearby!

Hell, I'd pick the bad restaurants down in OC than this place."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Best Asian place in Isla Vista. 

My favorite things to eat here:

Chicken Wings:
Best chicken wings I've ever had in my life. The flavor is unreal. So good I almost feel like I'm spoiling myself too much whenever I order it.

Pho:
Very flavorful broth. You can request which broth you want!! (Beef, Veggie, or Chicken) the bowls come in two sizes: regular & large. And large is an amazingly generous portion! I'm a fan of the combination Pho personally. **pro tip: if you're a chili head like I am, ask for chili oil paste! 

Bun Bo Hue (Spicy beef soup):
EXTREMELY flavorful broth! mild-medium spice level. This is my all time favorite noodle soup here. I always get the large portion. I can eat this everyday.

Fried rice:
My favorite is the shrimp fried rice, but pork fried rice is amazing too if you're not a seafood fan. Portions are beyond filling!

Vermicelli: 
I get this sometimes when I'm craving fish sauce. That's right, I said fish sauce. It comes dry with LOADED meat and veggies and side of fish sauce you can drench it in!!! Mmmmmm. 

last but not least

Sandwiches:
THE SANDWICHES!!! SOO CHEAP (under $5) BUT SOOOOO GOOD. Meat portions in the sandwich are insane!!! Get the BBQ Pork Sandwich! Get the sandwich combo and it comes with a drink if your choice!!

On to DRINKS...

The smoothies and flavored teas are delicious here. For smoothies, Taro is BOMB. For teas I recommend passion fruit tea with popping boba! 

I have yet to try the Chinese dishes here but I will update when I do!

Only con is pricing can be expensive but we're in IV so $10 filling meals are reasonable. Plus they give you a 10% discount if you bring cash lol I always forget but the place is conveniently located near bank ATMs."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"i'd rather stay home and starve then go here. Just go a little further into Goleta and anything is better then this ]: Just the thought that i could get two delicious bowls of pho for the price of one pho bistro bowl. WEnt once, never went back."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Usually terrible service, watery pho, vermicelli is sometimes okay and the spring rolls and shrimp are okay also. Asian workers are bluntly racist. My boyfriend had to pull out cash (we are both african american) and while he was gone I just paid instead because they weren't accepting cards. The employees started asking if he was going to kill them if they let me pay because he's black. Really now? Really. I don't know how this place still has business. Gross milk tea as well. Shame on this establishment. The people there for take out will 9/10 times get their food long before you will dining in. Gross dollar tree cups. Overpriced. Just avoid this place..."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I've had way better pho and much better service than this place. And it's super greasy, I feel as though half the broth is just grease."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"DoorDash was super fast, but man. This is the worst food I've ever gotten from a restaurant. I'm sure they're trying their best, but the pork had an awful and bizarre burnt taste, the chicken had a positively mysterious color and texture, and everything but the meat was totally flavorless. The only tolerable item was the beef banh mi. Utter waste of $40."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,Love pho bistro!!!! Great food! Been going here for years and it just keeps getting better.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Pho Bistro is a pretty good restaurant! My best friend and I often grab a bit to eat here, so much so that the people working here know us by sight, LOL...Anyway, the food is quite good, with reasonable prices. I especially enjoy their fresh juices and their Pad Thai. I'm not much of a one for ordering delivery, but I did once to satisfy a craving for this Pad Thai in particular. Though not my absolute favorite spot in Isla Vista/Goleta for pho (see my review of Saigon Noodle House for that), their pho is also quite good. Their spring and egg rolls are very tasty and more than enough for two people to share. Finally, I've had good experiences all around with the staff who work here; they've always been very nice, and provide fast, efficient service as well. If you're looking for a reasonably priced Asian place in IV, and some damn good Pad Thai, stop in!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"This place was awesome!  great taste and superb value, I got the pork banh mi and it was only $4 or $5 and it was massive!  A lot of food for a little price, and great flavor, that's my kind of place!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"I am not an expert on Vietnamese cuisine by any means, but I really love the vermicelli here. My favorite is #32 with chicken and shrimp. It's really flavorful with the perfect amount of peanuts and basil. It's a nice change from all the burritos and pizza so readily available in Isla Vista. 

Hint: Do not eat this on a date. The noodles are quite messy to eat and can splatter all over the place if you're not careful. :)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"We all know that IV is not the place for the best Asian food. This place is decent, the vegetable is fresh, and the lady running the business is very nice. I hope the rare beef could be rare when it's handed to me so I can put it in hot soup (like what most other pho places do)."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Ordered from this place on DoorDash a handful of times and my experience is mostly pleasant. They have a huge menu, from pho to Chinese. This is definitely not a gourmet restaurant, given that it's in a college town.. the food I get sometimes seems rushed and they messed up my drink order once by adding boba (I'm not a fan!)

But overall the food taste good and it's by far the fastest restaurant on DoorDash near my area. My food gets to my house 5 miles away in less than 35 minutes every time and I've been happy with the quality so far! I'm definitely gonna keep ordering from this place!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Pho is my favorite hangover cure, but definitely not when it's from Pho Bistro.

Straight to the point: overpriced and awful. 

The pho was just plain bad. As the only pho place in Isla Vista, my theory is that there's no pressure from competition for them to cook up quality food for a good price. The broth (which has a pretty dominant influence on your meal, and my favorite part) was extremely greasy. Gross.

I've never tried anything else here but I noticed a lot of others were getting the fried rice. I came here to fix my pho craving, but my recommendation is to just wait until you can get your hands on something better."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Ordered the Pho Chin, which came out a bit too fast (approximately one minute after ordering); while there was plenty of meat to go around, the meat consisted of primarily gelatinous fat. Additionally, it was super gray in color/veiny, incredibly difficult to chew, and tasted stale. Texture-wise, the noodles were clumpy and a bit too firm as well. The broth was suspiciously bubbly and tasted like there was soap in it. (Even the water served tasted like chlorine.) Needless to say, I didn't end up finishing. 

All of this would equate to a two-star review, but what really lowered the rating for me was how nauseous I felt after my meal. My stomach roiled and I kept running to the toilet the whole night. Since I didn't eat anything after this disappointment, I'm thinking it might have been the meat. It's a huge pity because when I came earlier this summer, the pho was nowhere near as bad, and (most of the time) the service is pretty welcoming. However, for the sake of my gut, I won't be back."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I actually usually like this place for it's pho. Not as good as actual Vietnamese places but this works for what's in the area. Service is alright. Last time me and my date ate here though, there was a roach in my pho. A full on roach. I still paid for the food after because I didn't want to be *that* customer. But yeah, I don't think I can come back to this place after that. Real shame though, it was good food for the past couple years I've been here."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"Pho Bistro is pretty good for pho being available in the IV area. The only thing that I would really have to say here is that the food is slightly overpriced for my liking. Also, I feel like every time I ask for no cilantro in my pho, they don't deliver my requests. Depending on what time you come here, it may be really rowdy due to the crowds outside, but aside from that, the food comes out fairly quickly, which I can always appreciate. I would recommend Pho Bistro to anyone who enjoys Vietnamese food!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"This pho place has the best quality pho soup. The food here never disappoint me time and time again. Every time I'm in town I have to stop by pho bistro. Beside the pho soup, I also love their crunchy shrimp rolls, omg yummy !!! The soup tasted even more delicious as a hang over cure lol. Especially when it's cold, the soup is perfect for my tummy.  The staffs are pretty friendly and attentive. When I'm not in the mood for the pho soup, I would switch to the fried rice. I love this place and would definitely go back!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Made the mistake of coming by here before since the smell was so delicious, but I was sorely disappointed upon trying their pho. With small portions for the price, as well as blow quality, hardened noodles, I'm definitely not coming back :)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,I only ever leave 1 star reviews if i have to and i think this was the time. I ordered chicken phad thai and while the noodles were pretty i okay the chicken was AWFUL. it had a very fishy taste and smell which should never happen since it is CHICKEN. I also got the shrimp egg rolls which were very bitter and had a fishy aftertaste like the shrimp was old. After only a few bites my stomach hurt. I will never order from here again
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Taste of the coffee is good strong and a good bitter but not sweet enough for my taste. Outdoor seating available good vibes.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"The pho is not the best in Santa Barbara, but I've gone here a few times. The pho is pricier than other places away from Isla Vista and not as good but I definitely come here when there's no one to drive me to Goleta. 

The atmosphere is different from other pho restaurants I've been too in California. They show you the ingredients they put in the pho in a little jar and I think that's a pretty neat idea. I can make pho myself and the stuff 
they have in there is actually a major part of the pho flavor.

Also, the customer service is good. Really friendly."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Nice to see that there's a Vietnamese restaurant in Isla Vista near UCSB. However, since I've tried Vietnamese food at many places in the 626 San Gabriel Valley area like GD, I think I know what good Vietnamese food tastes like. 

Pho Bistro did not meet my expectations. Their milk tea boba lacked flavor and the chicken on their banh mi sandwich was chewy & bland. Their spring roll also looked a little anemic."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"DISGUSTING!! Avoid at all costs, i feel like i need to throw up after eating the food from here!!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"One star for the food, and to remind my future self to never return.
Service was decent when we came but gosh, the food was not. I ordered their chicken pad thai and it pains me to say this (given how friendly the server was) but the pad thai was honestly the WORST pad thai I've ever had. How can someone mess up such a simple dish? The pad thai was tasteless and the chicken had a strong baking soda aftertaste (it was just weird).

Tips: there's a 10% discount if paid by cash"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I always went to Pho Bistro while I was attending UCSB so I honestly would like to give it a good review, but because of the lack of consistency at this restaurant, I'm gonna go ahead and give it 3 stars. Why am I posting this review when I graduated in Dec 2019? I just happened to find a draft of the review below that I forgot to post in 2019 so here it is:

I don't like their pho (it has a very strong cinnamon-y taste for some reason).
I really like their grilled pork vermicelli and passionfruit juice on their GOOD DAYS. However, at least 1 out of every 5 times i go there, there is always a problem with my order. For example, the fish sauce they give you with the vermicelli has tasted expired ~5 times (i've probably ordered it like more than 20 times LOL) and their passionfruit juice can be SO good but it definitely is a hit or miss depending on the day. 1 out of 3 times the passionfruit juice also tastes like it has gone bad. It's usually more like a juice, but on the bad days it tastes a bit like alcohol and also a little carbonated, which probably means that it's gone bad. I try to ask for a little sample before I order so that I can check on the quality of the drink that day. 

The boss will also argue with you that there's nothing wrong with it or that they make the two things fresh every day, but I'm pretty sure something's wrong when it doesn't taste like it usually does. But one of the workers that used to work there (Sunny) was super friendly and nice!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I have always liked the soup and most meals prepared by this restaurant.  However, recently the customer service has been extremely POOR.  It took about 10 minutes to have one of the waiters bring my girlfriend and I a cup of water and about 20 minutes later our soups finally arrived only to have multiple GNATS in both of our soups.  If you are looking for a place with shitty customer service and BUGS IN YOUR SOUP then Pho Bistro is the right place for you!  Oh yeah... they also didn't give us a discount :)"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"To be honest, value wise you're getting the most-mostly noodles with a few pieces of beef and bits of cilantro, onion, and green onion. It's a little lacking  for the price.

That being said, the broth is good and for a sad college student it kinda hits"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I got a shrimp bun bowl (rice vermicelli bowl).  The shrimp itself was tasty, but beyond that, the bowl had hardly any flavor.  Maybe the chef forgot some ingredients that day, but I've never tasted a bun bowl like that with no flavor.  Beyond that, I went to the back to use the restroom, and the restaurant just seemed dirty like grime on walls and light switch plates.  That type of thing just tells me that ownership is okay with dirt/grime, and I just don't want that where I'm eating.  The staff was friendly."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Had a banh mi. The bread was completely stale and meat was cold. Not worth your money
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Just ordered the curry w/ rice and found metal from what looks like a kitchen scrubber in my food. Wondering how it got there. Lost my appetite. This is also a safety hazard as the metal is quite sharp.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,Pho was awful the manager was rude to the customers and i believe the old guy was being fake by acting all nice but i overheard him yelling and talking in viet about their workers that aren't viets about how bad they are. I am a son of a manager at a Pho place in OC and my father don't treat customers/workers with disrespect and yells at them.. I think this place is bad overall plus the pho taste bad if you want good pho i suggest you drive down to Orange County WHERE THE TRUE Viet Pho is made at!
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"The food here is okay, and the boba and drinks are pretty good, but to be honest, I don't think I'll be coming here again.
I've been here a few times and I've known for a while that the service is not great. But I decided to keep coming back because its the only place that serves pho in IV. The last time I came here, however, I found a HUGE bug in my vegetable/toppings bag in my to go order! Good thing I double checked to make sure the food was right! But when I went back inside to ask for a refund, they would only refund me for the pho, not the entire meal. 
I was very disappointed, in many aspects, and am sad to say I will not be coming back:/"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Home of the driest chicken north of the Sahara dessert... I hope you brought some Vaseline and eye drops with to eat at Pho bistro because they have bbq chicken and rice so dry it'll chap your lips, crack your knuckles, and dry out your contact lenses. I honestly couldn't tell where the meat stopped and where the bone started. I heard this chicken spontaneously combusted when someone added hot sauce and sparked the 2018 Goleta wild fires. Put this chicken at the bottom of your desiccants bottle to keep them dry."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Ugh! Terrible pho and it has no flavor. I got mine as take out, so I ordered just the Pho Ga(chicken pho) and the chicken was dry and the broth was so plain. I was sick, and pho is my go to food, so I had no choice but to bear the bland pho from Pho Bistro. Such a disappointment, but oh well. I haven't tried anything else, and I don't plan on it."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,"The pho is quite good. I would say that it is a bummer that they don't offer tendon or tripe which is what really makes a bowl of pho ""shine"" in my opinion, and there was a relatively scarce amount of meat, but the broth did have a relatively complex development of flavor, though not ""phenomenal.""

Their drinks were quite good and they even had fresh coconut which was surprising given the setting of the restaurant. The servers were really nice and friendly to talk to and even offered a free drink on the house!"
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Honestly, the food is not good. If you want an honest review of ethnic food, look for someone who is of that ethnicity to get an honest opinion of it. Especially for the price, it is definitely not worth it. I am Vietnamese and grew up eating authentic delicious Vietnamese food and this is far from it. Yes it will satisfy those who have never had Vietnamese food before or who don't know what good pho tastes like. I've walked by and seen broccoli and carrots in their soups like bun bo hue or pho, broccoli and carrots are definitely not supposed to be in those soups. Also it is way too overpriced for the small portion. Would only eat here if I was extremely desperate and had no means of going to Noodle City, but I will exhaust every option I can to go there rather than having to come here. Two stars because they're trying but I would not recommend."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"Strolled here desperate for pho because Noodle City was closed. We asked if they were still open and yes they were. We were seated and after mulling over the menu settled on some orders of Pho. 

But then...waitress comes back from kitchen and is like ""would you mind taking this to go?"". Wtf hell nah. I was already settling on your lame pho and now you want me to take it to go? Nah

I hope they made it to the party they were talking about because I went that Friday night without a bowl of pho.

Avoid."
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,I tried the chicken pho here and it tasted like there was fish sauce in it- I asked them and they said there wasn't which had me believe they may not have washed the dish very well or perhaps some cross contamination because it was definitely fishy. Anyway I hate fish sauce so I couldn't enjoy the soup. The second time I went I tried a vegan pho so that there would be no chance of fish sauce and it was alright. Perhaps they shouldn't have named the place pho bistro because I hear that there sandwiches are really good. It's hard to find good soup in Isla Vista and state street in my opinion. Maybe I'm just use to Irvine/ Westminster/ and Korea town quality so my standards are higher.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,positive,The owner is so great! Such good food and great vibe! We got so much food and it was really inexpensive.
bdfZdB2MTXlT6-RBjSIpQg,Pho Bistro,Chinese,negative,"I needed a hot bowl of something to warm me up so I decided to try Pho Bistro. It was neither impressive nor terrible. I ordered pho with meatballs. The meatballs were pretty juicy, but the broth was subpar and the bean sprouts served alongside the soup seemed a bit old. 

This is the only pho place in IV. That being said, my meal wasn't bad enough that I'd venture outside of IV for pho, but it wasn't good enough that I'd go back unless I had a killer craving for pho."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"Went here today and the food was authentic and delicious! Ordered the shredded potato and steamed noodles and they were great. It's hard finding good and authentic Chinese restaurants in the area, so I'm glad I checked this place out. Servers were nice and helpful and made always made sure that me and my friends were doing well while we were eating"
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"I'm so thankful for the existence of Su's Bowl in IV. When I didn't want Dumpling King nor Mojo but a bigger variety of Asian food, I loved going here. My favorite food is the mapo tofu. It has that szechuan pepper sensation that makes your mouth a little numb. Eat it with rice and the portion easily made two meals for me because the flavors are quite intense. It comes super hot and the oil may spill a bit in your bag. 

I also got the dan dan noodles and they were quite dry and very peanut butter-y, not as easy to pull up with my chopsticks as with other places I've had before. I think it could've used more salty flavoring.

Lastly, I got the meat up pot. I loved the amount of cabbage and again, this can last two meals. It is so flavorful. I think it's meant to be shared because it's pretty expensive ($24 I believe) but I didn't mind eating it on two separate days.

The service here has always been prompt when I did to-go during quarantine. It takes normally 15-20 minutes for a phone order. Overall, it gets expensive but that's the price of Asian food in Santa Barbara. Also, I tend to lower my standards for Asian food in this area but Su's Bowl has had big hits with me each time for the mapo tofu and meat up pot."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,negative,"I want to love this place so badly. I went yesterday and today, getting the minced pork over noodles yesterday and the shanghainese stewed pork today. Even though it was definitely pricey both times, I'm homesick enough for my mom's cooking that I'm more than willing to pay extra for good food. And while both dishes were good, the wait times were more than ridiculous. Today we went and ordered at 5:05 (grantees, pretty soon after they opened) and didn't get our food until 5:50ish despite being the only people waiting. I would have even been okay with it if they'd warned us they had many mobile orders and needed extra time or something, but they seemed more than okay with leaving us standing by the door for almost an hour. I might return one last time to see if it was a fluke of the past couple days, but today was frustrating enough that it's hard for me to return here."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"This location went through 3 or 4 slightly different versions of Chinese restaurant in the last 5 years.  There were problems with execution, consistency, service, and pace.  Even with those problems, the goal was always the same, provide relatively authentic Chinese food to Chinese students who crave home cooking.  Su's Bowl took the rein from We Cook, trimmed down the menu size, and introduced a couple of Western Chinese dishes in addition to the popular Sichuan cuisine.  I liked the pork burger, a popular Western Chinese street food consisted of tender chopped braised meat in between a thick split griddled pancakes.  The beef noodle soup was a little watery, but the braised beef was cooked to perfection.  The steamed noodle, another common Western Chinese dish was so flavorful and I actually preferred it over the beef noodle soup."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,I haven't been to this location since the other Chinese restaurant was here. They seemed to clean the place up and made the menu more manageable. They kept my favorite dish which is the pig intestines tossed in dry chile pepper. The new manager suggest the hot pepper pork but instead of jalapeños he made it with Serranos which made it much more spicy. Thank you for accommodating my love of spicy food! They also have a buy one get one on Axxess.
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,Authentic and delicious food! The noodles had the perfect texture and were super flavorful. The Chinese hamburgers were great as well. Only concern is that the food tends to be on the greasy side Atmosphere is casual and was great for a family lunch!
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,negative,"This restaurant is experiencing the same problems as the 3-4 previous Chinese restaurants at this location.  They can't maintain a consistent quality.  The lamb burger was so spicy that you can't taste other flavors.  The pork burger was still pretty good, but there were no cilantro and scallions like last time.  The beef burger was flavored with cumin, but had a too mushy texture.  The steamed noodle wasn't as fresh this time as some of the noodles were hard and dry.  Lastly, the chili oil noodle consisted of 2 very long strands of noodle served with chili oil.  Whatever happened to vegetables, scallions, and cilantro?"
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,negative,"Good food, but they never answer their phone. Also, they never have hours posted anywhere, in store or online. It's a shame because they have really good food, but you never know when it's available."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,Best Chinese food in  town. Loved the Mongolian beef and the sizzling pot. The menu might seems confusing but the food are actually really good. They also provide excellent service. Definitely will come again!!
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"First time here! Had the lamb noodle soup and spicy and sour potato. Both were so good!! Loved the 3 different kinds of noodles in the soup (wide, bean, and tofu noodles I think). Highly recommend! My boyfriend from China approves :)"
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"Food here is always yummy.  I've had the mongolian chicken bento, which was delicious, and the potato bell pepper eggplant stir fry, which is my go-to favorite.  Flavorful, fresh, good quality.  A bit more expensive than the competitive takeout asian food, but worth it."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"A great place for some real Chinese food!
Not over priced. Love the noodles and the Chinese burger."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"Good food, but they never answer their phone. I have to call multiple times for them to answer and it's quite irritating."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"I had the spicy squid. I'm a pretty white guy but I like spice, so I was expecting something with maybe some spicy Mayo or whatever, a few pieces of squid, and some rice. I had a date to go on with this new guy so I wanted something that could be a fun talking point. 

It was a talking point alright. 

Five seconds in and it's the spiciest thing I've ever eaten. My entire face burns with the intensity of crunching red-hot coals in the pits of hell. A few minutes in and my tongue goes completely numb. My lips tingle so much they're practically vibrating. My entire body is screaming for help but I dont stop eating this amazing squid. It was fresh, done to perfection, and a good ratio of meat to vegetables. 

Now this guy is being pretty nice about offering me water and whatnot, but I have never looked more unattractive. Snot is drizzling down my face. I'm practically crying. But it's so good I dont stop eating (plus it was kinda expensive and I didnt want to waste it). We're both laughing over this food and I'm trying to offer him some but he's vegetarian. He'll never know how spicy that was, or how good the meal tasted to make me keep eating it even though I was dying. We did not have a second date. Probably because he thinks I'm some sort of culinary masochist. I guess I kind of am."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,negative,"If you are looking for average food that takes forever, messed up dishes and wrong order, and waitresses that ignore you and treat you like an enemy, you got it! No a 'sorry' after missing one dish from our order and keep us waiting for 40 minutes, no Answer until called very loudly, and cursing on us after check out in Chinese. She said something like fucking idiot, can't imagine how such a women full of hatred and zero gratitude can work in a service industry. Would never go again. I mean, one of the drawbacks, bad luck for us, all of these drawbacks? I wonder how this place operates."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,negative,"Great place if you want to ruin your day. WORST EXPERIENCE ever. First time they gave me my dishes with hair on it, which I understand is just an unintended mistake. So I asked for changing the dish instead of recook one for me. They gave me the exactly same dish in two minutes. Not sure how they did it or if it was still the same one. After I told the waitress the dish I want and she returned to the kitchen. I heard the cook cursing out on me in Chinese. And NO apology at all."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"Ordered the spicy intestine and lamb soup with vermicelli and Chinese biscuit.  Super delicious and authentic tasting.  I can't believe I found such authentic northern Chinese cuisine in Santa Barbara.  


The spicy intestine was loaded with chili's and it was a very large portion. 

The lamb soup came with a ton of sliced lamb meat and the broth was rich and fragrant.  The biscuit is perfect to use to sop up the soup.  

The man who took my order was also friendly and nice.  

10/10 would recommend"
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,negative,"Worse service ever, the waiters do not look at you unless you call them, I ordered take out and they said they put the rice into the bag, but there was no rice when I got home. This place needs to get new waiters instantly."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,negative,"Double post featuring two dishes at Su's Bowl! Given the extremely large menu, it was difficult to pick which items to try but alas these were the chosen ones. Really like everything in the beef noodle soup except the beef; the broth was flavorful and had a mild kick of spice. It was very refreshing with the classic pairing with some poached veggies. The noodles were well made as well, and was springy and soft at the same time. The beef, however, was tough and chewy.

The pork bun was suboptimal, it was salty, oily, and hard to eat. However, the fact that the bun was seared was interesting. Needs some much needed pickled vegetable in the dish."
MiMRlsXOpHJMSTDAuw8s1w,Su’s Bowl,Chinese,positive,"This place is AMAZING!!!
Passed by this place all the time but never stoped by. Finally decided to give it a try and it was bomb!! 
Me and my friend ordered big plate spicy chicken, beef stewed noodle, and lamb soup.
What surprised me was the spicy chicken was so flavorful and the portion was BIG. We were told they made this dish with their secret sauce. The noodles came with it was great too! It's different from the regular noodles you have from the other places, this wide and flat kind bring out the flavor so well. I have to say the noodles literally amazed me!!!
Go try it out guysss!
One thing to keep in mind is the portion is pretty big, so go with friends!!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"SO good! Not very healthy, but I can't resist the orange chicken, broccoli beef, and grilled teriyaki chicken (and this is coming from a Chinese girl!)

Here's a tip: each time you order, complete the survey on the back of the receipt for a free entree next time you come. If you keep doing this you'll get an endless cycle of free entrees :)"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Love Panda, this location has serious management issues. 2 stars is a stretch, but when you do get the food it is good.

Every time I go, they never have adequate staffing and the staff always complain that they've been short-staffed all day.

One time I went in they had 2 options for entrees (orange chicken and something else) and everything else had a wait, and the line was to the door with about 15 people in line, which is what another reviewer mentioned as well as the posted pictures. And this has happened on multiple occasions. They seem to have 2 people cooking, 1 person washing dishes, and 1 person serving food (maybe 2).

One time there was a line to the door and only 1 poor girl to serve food while there was 1 girl and 1 cook sitting down at the table in clear sight. I understand they legally have to take their lunch, but don't do it in front of a line of customers who are watching you.

I asked for one of the ""premium"" items one time that costs $1 more and they said its frozen and has to be ""prepared"" and would take at least 20 minutes...if I wanted to wait that long, I would have went to a sit-down restaurant.

Please review this place if you experience similar as they hopefully will make some changes."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,The service gets extremely slow once the sun goes down. I guess since they figure they are two hours to closing time they should just have one person helping customers behind the counter? They also let this weird old lady hang around the store and disturb customers. Not a pleasant experience all in all. The only good thing is the TV's they have on the walls.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"There are lots of people waiting in line! But it's really clean place to eat inside. I had really good experience ordering online, using coupon code and just waited for pick up! That will save your time!!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"The food is 5-star.  I do miss the eggplant and tofu, and barb-b-que pork dishes being dropped from the menu."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I've lived here for about 5 years but never even ate here because I was scared of the reviews! Solid, quick, but I could def see that many items were low or gone and options were limited as a result. Id recommend getting half chow mein and fried rice as the base!

Portions provided in the combos aren't always even which is a bit disappointing opening your box and seeing mostly a small portion of mostly green beans with 3 pieces of chicken in a 2-3 item combo. Orange chicken is usually on point. The beef with broccoli was alright, slightly sketchy taste but beware of the sauce cause it can spill all over the bag and everywhere and be a no fun why did I choose you mess!

I was surprised to see how long the line can get for this place! I like how they offer you hot sauce when you leave now and wish they had the sweet & sour soup here also!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Many times I ordered a bowl with one entry. But what I got was a bowl full of white rice but very little entry. This is my firsthand experience. I had the similar review on another Panda Express, just because I had the same experience there. I will not choose these places any more."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I really miss the tofu and spicy eggplant. I always get half chow mein and half steamed vegetables, mostly very good. But under no circumstances should you even put one of those awful carrots into your mouth. I can't imagine what they have done to the carrots, but they taste like poison.  And maybe cut the broccoli just a little bit more...."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Place still doesn't seem to have improved. Constantly low on all items to where if the 2 people in front of you happen to want the same thing you want, then you have to wait for them to make more. Come in too early or too late, they have even fewer items and don't have the lights on. Most recently, I could tell the teriyaki chicken they were cutting for me was very pink and she still put it in the box. They seem to rarely ever have more than 1 person working the food, and sometimes the same person is running back and forth between the food and ringing you up. I would stick to the higher volume mall locations"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"Love the teriyaki chicken with brown rice after a workout. 36g of protein in the chicken, but skip the high calorie sauce."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,Every time I come here they literally have NOTHING. They really need to make the food when it's half way gone instead of making it when everything is gone. I left after they started filling my box with rice and chow mien since there was no orange or teriyaki chicken ready they said i would have to wait 5 minutes.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Yeah, they'll totally mop all around your feet with stinky mop water while you're eating."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I give it 3.5 

My go to place when I don't know what to eat. I always get their honey walnut shrimp and sweet fire chicken breast, they're my favorites. 

I honestly think the food here is decent and not as bad as people think it is. They have a variety of entrées to choose from and for a person who is looking for cheap eats, this place is good... but definitely not gourmet though. 

Service is ok. It can be really busy during peak hours and a line usually forms. The servers are kind of slow sometimes and not the friendliest."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,I go there for lunch sometimes and the service is always great ! They are quick to get the line down and the cashiers are always friendly !
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"There are lots of people waiting in line! But it's really clean place to eat inside. I had really good experience ordering online, using coupon code and just waited for pick up! That will save your time!!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,Served by a blonde white female with the dirtiest nails. It was so disgusting that I had to refuse her service and ask the older Asian lady to attend me. Im horrified by the idea that this woman could have served my lunch with her nails that looked like she had just came from putting an engine in a car. Makes wonder how clean the cook's hands are...
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,Mattae was great! Customer service was on point! Couldn't have had a better experience at Panda Express all the guys were working hard to get that line down and customers there food!
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,How many ways can you say slow. Not just a little slow like TSA at the airport; I mean so slow you forgot what you ordered by the time they ask you to pay.  Mystery meat and copious amounts of salt. In a single word BAD!
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I arrived 40 minutes before closing and they took all food off the buffet. The only thing available to order was rice, chow main, and spring rolls. I asked if they had any more food and they told me ""I guess we could cook something if you want .""  So much for customer service. I know it's just food, but still..."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"I never thought I'd be writing a review for a Panda Express, but it has sincerely become my go-to Asian restaurant that a college student could afford in SB.  All Panda Expresses are the same but I like how I always get $1 off for taking the phone/online survey when ordering a paw plate. $5.49 for a 3 item plate with non-premium entrees. Not too bad... Food for two meals."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,Months later and things still have not improved. I have to change my order because two items are completely empty.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"Not comparing it to a nicer restaurant, but for a Panda, it's 5/5. 

Servings are very generous especially compared for the excuse of a meal you usually get the the UCen Panda.

Staff is nice and service is relatively expedient. Interior is clean and there is plenty of parking."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"SLOW.

I know the shift changes and the people who work the front are changing all the time, but I ran into the worst front crew. They we're so slow, the line behind me ran 13 people long. I counted. Not making it up. To further justify what I'm saying, as opposed to a bunch of people just showing up at the same time, I can tell you that it took 4 separate scoops of friend rice before the quantity seemed right to this person's liking.  Just a sample of why that line stacked up."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Staff always tries t o up sell me, other than that I love this place when I need a quick lunch. Not gourmet dining though!

oh, yea parkings sucks tho. Park behind OSH if you can."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"I went back to try Panda Express again.  I hate to give a bad review and leave it at that.

Once again, a few issues.  First, always check your order in the store if you are going to take it out.  On more than one occasion the order was not completed correctly.  Second, plan to spend time there.  Many popular dishes are not kept ready to go.  You have to wait and wait.  While I applaud many restaurants for factoring in waste, sometimes they carry it to excess.  Keep trying!  The recipes are very good, it's just hard to get the really good help today.  I think they're trying to improve."

Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"We are loyal customers here. We've been coming here for 10+yrs as we work in Goleta. 

The past few times we have been disappointed, enough to write a review. It's hard to mess up Panda, but this location has managed to do it. 

The serving size has gradually gotten smaller and smaller and smaller. I used to take food to go. Now I leave hungry. 

It's one very small scoop of your choice (don't choose anything with veggies as you will get 90% veggies and 10% meat). VERY SMALL. 
One time the server put a little bit too much on my plate and she took a few pieces of chicken off!! Ridiculous! The scoops are terrible small lately. 

Also, the pre-packaged teriyaki sauce is awful. If it sits out too long it turns jello-ey. 
And now the sweet and sour sauce is also pre packaged. WHY!?!? 
Nobody likes dipping hot fried Panda in COLD SAUCE!

I will continue to eat here. We miss Astrid!!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,The staff is awesome and the manager Noah is always friendly and welcoming. I can't go wrong choosing to eat their.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"My fried rice was dry and crunchy, the wait for Mushroom Chicken was long and the orange chicken was also dry.  So I waited a long time for a lousy meal. What a bummer."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,The staff is extremely nice and helpful.. the food it very on point and very fresh. Great for my daughter and myself!
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Well what can I say about this particular panda. I've been to plenty and this one is pretty big with lots of seating and the place was clean. Food was good but it normally is unless they don't rotate a fresh batch of whatever you pick. 
Overall good place for quick Chinese food since I still have yet to a tasty Chinese food spot, in the area. So this panda satisfies my craving.

My order was beef and broccoli and Orange chicken. Half fried rice and chow mein"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I went back to try Panda Express again.  I hate to give a bad review and leave it at that.

Once again, a few issues.  First, always check your order in the store if you are going to take it out.  On more than one occasion the order was not completed correctly.  Second, plan to spend time there.  Many popular dishes are not kept ready to go.  You have to wait and wait.  While I applaud many restaurants for factoring in waste, sometimes they carry it to excess.  Keep trying!  The recipes are very good, it's just hard to get the really good help today.  Well, we tried PE again, and once again, the excuse for the lack of food is ""we had a rush.""  Someone there doesn't get it.  What's the point of going if they are always out?

They have been critiqued negatively before, but they're not taking it to heart!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Came in 50 minutes before closing time and all they had left was base entrees and fresh orange chicken. My family and I were ready to drop around $50-60 dollars on Panda Express but they refused to make anything fresh or to order for us because they were ""closing soon."" AKA in 50 MINUTES. Now I'm not trying to be a Karen here, but your business could make a lot more money if you just cooked to order when it's late. It's alright because we settled for Taco Bell, but after seeing the reviews on here for this franchise, I can understand that they lack in quality AND customer service. 

Their fried rice is also extremely chewy and hard, and the chow mein was dry. Hopefully someone will start taking care of this business."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Always the go to place for fresh food. Today was very disappointing, only 2 employees trying to handle the dinner crowd. Food was not fresh tonite and portions were small. 
Hopefully you hire more people so you continue to stay in business. 
Not very many good places to eat out in Goleta."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Closed "" until further notice""

It is fast food so ...

I found the food fresh, good variety, healthy, low fat, very salty. 

The restaurant, tables, and restrooms are plentiful and clean. 

I going down the cafeteria line the staff tends to yell at you about what you want from 10 feet ahead of you. This really hurts the experience because:
1) you don't know what you want because it is yet to far away. 
2) you can't hear because they are screaming at you
3) it raises the tension because the server in front of you is screaming at the person 10 feet behind you. 

It contributes to a hurry and get it done attitude rather that a friendly ""how can I help you"" atmosphere. I am sure these highly compensated employees time is valuable, but not screaming is nice"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"One of the worst managed restaurants I've ever had the misfortune to use. Open at 10 am and at 11 am have less than half of their entrees cooked. Asked how long for what I wanted and was told 5 minutes.  20 minutes later they hadn't even started it. 

Previously ordered online at 7:40 pm , said it would be 15 minutes. Then at 7:55 they call me and say they weren't doing my order since they were closing at 8 even though their hours were until 9. Then asked if I wanted it for the next day!!!! Then they charged me !!!  I had to call my credit card company to get it reversed. 

This is a management issue"

Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"This is by far the most unreliable Panda restaurant that ever existed. Imagine walking in, eager to eat some delicious food you have been craving, and after waiting 20 mins in line they tell you they are out of their main ingredient because of miss communication. That's like walking into Apple and them not carrying the iPhone... 
Get it together Panda Goleta. 

For all you customers, to avoid disappointment, drive to the next closest Panda. 

-pissed off customer"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,This location has some of the most inconsiderate and rude employees. I'm not sure if it's the pandemic or that they just have to be working. The employees get angry when you order something that they actually have to make on the spot rather than something already made. I hope management can change some attitudes here.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"They say they close at 10 but by 9 they only have chow mien, rice and deep fried leftovers."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I asked for a free sample, which they do.
However, they said they stopped giving free samples because of the the coronavirus.
Which is bullshit, they are just trying to save money. Sticking a toothpick into a small piece of food is not going to make a person sick. Besides, why bother serving food all together if they won't serve one small piece?
They, actually have argoance to think that their customers are stupid enough to believe that serving a small sample causes the spread of the coronavirus.
Think about it, if any employee has the virus, they should not be working, if any utensil, equipment and or surface has the virus then the place will be closed.

I currently work at a kitchen and every employee is checked for symptoms by a nurse prior to clocking in for their shift.

After, I mentioned my opinion about their current status of free samples, think they did something to my food, it tasted different, not the same as before.

I could be wrong, just not sure.

Anyway, a business that treats customers by lying to them, makes me question their ethics to the greater good of the people they serve.

Thank you"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"The veggies are not fully cooked, and the trays here are way too dirty.  Sometimes they stink, and often they are sticky and wet to touch. To make it worse, when you ask for a water cup the employee places the cup upside down on the tray. Yuk!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Came here at 1120 , an hour and a half after they opened and they only had 3 dishes ready. They walked around leisurely while there were customers waiting, not even taking the time to acknowledge anybody. Waited an additional 20 mins to get my food . Absolute worst service ever"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I don't know how but they have 4-5 entrees empty at the same time and it isn't busy. What happened? I saw them throw away a batch of string beans, but why are there 4 more empty entrees.

The food is consistent as a Panda Express but I paid 15 minutes ago and I'm still waiting for my entrees to be cooked. If they were busy, they'd be screwed."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Phuong is the cashier most of the time and hates serving just about everyone. Always in a terrible mood, should just quit. Been there way too long.

Most of the time the scoops are garbage, especially if you are white. Witnessed proof of this multiple times. 

The sweet and sour sauces are all pre made and tiny. Need three of them to equal one. Same with the teriyaki sauce. Not even heated up or anything. Garbage.

If Phuong is your scooper, she will put a scoop on your plate, and if it's too much for her liking, she will literally SCOOP A PIECE OFF YOUR PLATE AND PUT IT BACK. Unreal.

If she forgets to put something in your bag and you have to ask again, it's like the end of the world for her. Garbage. 

Will not be back. Enjoy."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"The fact that this establishment has below a 5 star rating is truly absurd. Panda Express is the pinnacle of class and represents a fusion of exquisite tastes. Panda Express team members, thank you for your service, dedication and sacrifice."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST panda I've ever experienced. I love panda and this time when I order online they totally slandered my order. My chow Leon was an absolute JOKE. My egg rolls were cold .My order didn't contain any sweet and sour sauce for my ragoons. My Roomate didn't get ANY teriyaki on his TERIYAKI chicken. That's right plain bare chicken that was soggy and mushy. They also gave me white rice when there was no white rice ordered AT ALL. No soy sauce was added. Service was just awful. DO NOT GO
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"If yelp allowed for it, I would not give any stars to Panda. Today I walked in and Will who greeted us was very professional and pleasant. However, I waited for nearly 10 minutes at the register while the Hispanic girl (I don't know her name) was flirting in the back book with another coworker... then began speaking to another customer at the counter who had already eaten. She never acknowledged me standing there once. When she finally walked over to the cash register she answered her cell phone! We walked out. When customer service is that bad, the establishment does not deserve my money. I hope you retrain your cashiers/employees on proper customer service. That experience was ridiculous."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,This place has horrible customer service. The employees will rush you. They treat you like you should already know what to get before you come into that door. Due to being rushed one of the employees missed one of my items. I do not recommend this place.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"I usually like to eat panda but from the right places and make sure to go at the right time. This place was ok but if its not busy the food is not that worm, and the workers don't put much food ether."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"As much as I love Panda, I'm very disappointed with today's service. There are 6 people working and half of their items were empty. They didn't even have the courtesy to let anyone know how long it would take to make an item they were waiting for. I was waiting for an item and after already waiting 5 minutes I asked how much longer it would take to make my string bean chicken and the cook said 5 min cuz they were making Kung pow chicken instead which wasn't asked for until after my order. When I let the Cook know my order was supposed to be done first he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away. When my food was finally completely ready I asked the young man working behind the glass if he could ask his manager if I could have a free chicken eggroll for me waiting so long and the manager said no but I can have a veggie one. Thanks a lot panda I appreciate the free veggie eggroll I already know what those taste like I wanted to try the chicken one for my long wait...

And to top it off, when I got home and opened my container of the string bean chicken I was waiting for it wasn't even full. It was only half way filled practically... and No I didn't eat any yet! 

And now after eating it there was only one very small piece of chicken and the rest was string beans and onions... I'm so disappointed! 

I will change my review if service is better next time"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Good god! This was the worst food ever! I have only ordered from Panda Express once before, a few years ago, now I remember why I never ordered from there again.
I ordered the three entree option. 
The broccoli and beef - all broccoli, NOT one piece of beef
The Orange Chicken - tasted like fish, it was truly a fish taste and disgusting
The veggie rolls were stale and dry. 
The chow mein was dry.
Just gross - I am trying to drown the tatse with wine - I was hungry and ordered this for my dinner, terrible mistake!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"For my first experience I came at 9:15pm and they were literally closing up, and barely had 2 entrees out. I asked if they were going to make anymore orange chicken (why else does one eat at Panda Express) and they told me no. For their second chance I arrived at 9pm and they only had 3 entrees out. Thankfully two of those entrees were the ones I wanted. The orange chicken was the worst I have ever had. It was literally all hard fried bread with zero chicken (I ordered double orange chicken too)! My other entree and side thankfully were okay. My fortune cookie was stale and could not be enjoyed. How can this place still be open? 

I have eaten at my fair share of Panda Express restaurants (even lived in Pasadena), and this has to be the worst I have been to. I guess you should try eating there before 8:00 pm even though they close at 10?"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Definitely a place I go to often. Great orange chicken, love the honey walnut shrimps. It's pretty much the same at every Panda Express.

However, I can note that the management there is often awful. I say often because during the past couple years I've noticed that they have switched it a couple times.

It's very usual that one worker would be serving a dozen person in line by himself while other workers are just waiting at the cashier or doing something else instead of helping getting the customers through. 

Get ready to wait because they often have a very long line at peak hours. Not that nice of a service and it's hard to get a smile from a someone there. Depends when you go.

The stars really goes for the food because, well, it's Panda.
Think about ordering online they often have good deals going on and you get to skip the line and be in-and-out of this place!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"As a college student, I've grown to crave Panda Express despite its food comas and overly salty entrees + unflavored sides. I don't usually have issues with it, but today, I experienced the worst customer service I've ever had with the franchise. It's clear that this location does not care about customer health and safety, as you can see with the undercooked food in the previous reviews as well as with poor, inefficient business practices.

All restaurants are being hit hard by the coronavirus. I commend people in the community who choose to be a patron to their local small businesses. For me, I caved into my orange chicken craving... only to realize I should've supported SB Chicken Ranch in the same plaza.

I wanted my food to be as fresh as possible. When I ordered online, I put my pick-up time in 30 minutes so it'd be hot when we eat it. We drove 20 min to get there and waited for a bit to pick up (no one was at the front of the store and instead was chatting up together behind the counters). They gave us our bag, said goodbye, and then we drove home. 

When we got back to our dinner table, we opened our bag to see that half of the order was missing. Half of us don't have our food, and furthermore, it's going to be cold by the time we all eat. So we drove another 20 minutes there and back to get the missing part of our order. Overall, we spent 1h20min just on driving to the store.

I called in during the ride to ask for a remake of our food since it's all going to be cold, to which they said yes. I had to talk to two people because the first employee that picked up just dropped the phone; I had to talk about my situation all over again once I spoke to the second person. I asked that for future customers, PLEASE call if you forgot to give us parts of our order. The employee said they had no way of contacting us. Uhh... we left our name, email, phone number on the online order. ??? That was just a bad excuse. Furthermore, they were unable to re-make the other half of our food that was sitting cold at home because we ""already took it."" It was an entire family meal. We ended up with the cold first half of the order and the re-made missing half order. 

Additionally, we were given a verbal coupon of 20% off discount on our next purchase. For that, we need to go physically order in the store and mention the employee's name who was speaking on the phone. ""Don't worry, we'll write your name down,"" she said. Not only did the management here make us risk our time, gas, and health during this pandemic by making us take trips for their error, they also gave us a ""verbal"" coupon and want us to come physically use it instead of call-in or order online again. ??? At this point I'm just so confused.

Why we didn't check our bag before leaving the first time? It was all that we were given along with a ""goodbye"" from the staff. We walked to our car and drove for 20 minutes home without any call. 

I'm seriously disappointed by the absurdity of this. Shoutout to my microwave for being the chef of tonight's meal because that's all we used for our cold, lackluster food. (They also skimped on the entrees.)"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Frustrating to attempt to get food here. Website says open until 9:30 today. Call to double check, talk to polite employee who says only until nine. No problem, I get in the car and zip over, arriving at 8:35pm. Place is already closed, door locked, lights low, they are there in the dark breaking it down down for the night. Closing scene, me heading for pizza again."

He interacted with my little sister and was warm and friendly. The food was amazing and fresh. I'm happy there were vegetarian options. We need more people like Andrew!
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Disappointing service and food. Ordered ahead with the app and when I picked up my food I had to repeat my name 5 times for her to go search before she finally found my order. Panda usually has great standards and you can go to any restaurant and have it taste the same. Not here. The only thing that tasted right was our spring rolls, all the meat we ordered tasted weird, even the orange chicken tasted strange and more like teriyaki. The chow mein was burnt and terrible. Will not be visiting this location again."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"I stopped into panda tonight and had a fantastic experience Jose greeted me at the front. I asked about one of the new dishes (I did not ask to taste it because I know better they're not allowed to let you taste nor are there allowed to let you taste food at any other restaurants these days! Just wanted to get that in there for the guy who posted below thinking it's because they're cheap it's definitely not allowed currently just as you can't use your favorite hot food bars in local markets!) Jose was great he was very, enrgetic and accommodating and the dish he suggested was the new Angus steak dish and it was actually very good there was one piece of meat that was a little chewy but the rest of it was very tasty as well I would like to give props to the young lady who checked me out she was also very nice and her name was Cyan."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Terribly stingy people. I asked for half white half fried rice and it was like the guy took his time to make sure he didn't give too much. What ended up happening was he pretty much gave me about a third cup of each, not even enough to fill the spot. The Angus Steak I got had five small pieces of beef in it, and the orange chicken was bottom of the barrel and was soggy. The skin was even falling off the chicken because it was so soggy. Not to mention both sides were also equally less than you're supposed to get. Walking out that door with a plate that weighed half of what it was supposed to was incredibly upsetting. Paying over $11 for such small portions is a rip. Better off going elsewhere."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Pretty odd behavior for an Asian food restaurant.  No white rice?  Two hours before closing?  And then upset when you question them on it?  

Probably understaffed.  Always a line.  Food decent, but not quick...although called Panda EXPRESS.

I actually dropped my wife off at a nearby pizza place, so I could go to Panda Express.  She ordered a pizza, got it, ate 3 pieces of it and 2 beers while I was waiting in line at Panda Express.  

Again, nothing EXPRESS about P. E."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I watched as the Styrofoam containers were put in plastic bags so patrons could carry their lunch from the counter to a table 8, 10, 12 feet away. 10 minutes later, after the meal, the bags were thrown in the trash. Really?  Maybe switch to paper bags if you can't ask the patrons to do without. In this day and age please change your bad habits."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,The servings for a 2-entree plate is so little that it's not even enough for my 6 year old. Service is getting worse and worse.

Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,Always a good lunch quick walk to and from my job I like how opens at 10am I like to order either 1 side 2 entree or just a bowl to go and they serve Pepsi which I like
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,I like this location lots!! I have great time here and always get food I likes. The worker so happy and have a beauty look on their faces every time and it's so sweet and makes me pleased. I love to talk with them because I live by self and see them and gives me good conversation? Usually I am alone so it is nice to see them happy for me!! I put a photo of my favorite dish I get. It's yummy in my tummy and I like it so much delicious!! Love Goleta here and love panda so!!!
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,It's says that they are open until 9:30 p.m. There is a paper on the door that says they actually are open at 7 p.m. The doors were locked by 6:30. Couldn't buy food if I'd like to.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I wish they would update their hours at Panda Express.On Yelp they have the store closing at 9:30 pm but the employee said they close at 8 pm. Also,the exterior business sign is dark so even when they are  open it looks like they are closed."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,"Bottom Line: Four stars for the staff here for staying calm and carrying on in the face of some real jerks.  



The people that buy food here are terrible to the staff.  Cut these people some slack already - they are busting their backs to get you your precious orange chicken, ok?  Calm your pits, Karen.

Terrible.

I have been in this location many times and a review is well overdue.  I have overheard patrons yelling at the staff but today was worse than usual.

The way that people off of the street talk to the employees here is horrendous.  Just because it's a fast-food style place, doesn't give anyone the right to be a jerk.   Today a lady in a power suit went full on Karen mode saying inappropriate things (in a snarling and very nasal tone) ""IM CALLING YOUR MANAGER"".  My favorite part is that she left with her food and walked over to Chicken Ranch and used their tables to eat lunch!

That's real class.  

So you didn't get as much food as you wanted, why not yell in an accusatory way until you've embarrassed the employee to the point where they don't have a choice.

OR - maybe - just maybe - try being kind and discuss your concerns like a regular person.  Chances are, they will make it right.  

THEY ARE ALSO PEOPLE, JUST LIKE YOU.

Dont like it?  Take it up with corporate as THOSE people are the ones that hand down all of the marching orders.

Do you really think the people behind the counter getting minimum wage have a say in portion distribution??  They work for a huge company and they are doing what they have been trained to do because they don't want to get fired.

Today I had to kneel down and explain to my son that this is not the way we talk to or treat people - especially within the service industry.  I asked the staff if people were always that rude and they said ""We are used to it"".

That's horrifying - nobody should have to ever feel as if they should get used to people being that rude.

Why does my family keep coming back here again and again?  Partially because we are lazy and don't want to make dinner every night BUT ALSO because the food is exactly what you think it's going to be.  Its consistently good!  Do they make mistakes?  Of course they do!  I'll ya'll in on a little secret right now..... people makes mistakes NO MATTER where you are or what you're doing.

Thats life.  If you cant live with that, start your own town and tell me how that goes.  Im sure it'll be perfect.

I have worked in service based jobs for much of my life and still do.  Frankly, had someone spoken to me like that, they might have found themselves outside the building.

I hope that all the folks working here get a nice big fat raise for having to put up with the public at large...because nobody deserves to be treated like this.

Hang tough, Goleta Panda employees!"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Rude, rude, RUDE! Hopefully management can look at this review and realize they have a SERIOUS customer service problem. Just left there (Wednesday 6/23). Someone needs to tell these employees that they are open until 9:30 and that they should happily serve their customers until 9:30. Seems like they were completely inconvenienced with us showing up at 9:00 to eat and was even rudely escorted out at exactly 9:30."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Panda is Panda. Consistent at every location. 

But who is the marketing genius that thought it would be a good idea to yell ""Welcome!"" At everyone that walks in the door ?  It's not sincere and does not establish anything nor is a sign of appreciation.  You would be just fine without this step."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"Terrible service; line was out the door, very rude, not allergy accommodating. 1/5 for sure"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"This is the worst Panda Express I've ever been to. Placed an order online and it said it would be ready in 30 mins, arrived and it wasn't ready. Stood there for 20 mins still wasn't ready so I went out to the car and my husband went in to wait. He asked about the order status they said they were working on it, 10 mins later he asked again then they said they did not have our order and asked if we were sure we placed it for that location. He showed proof that we did so again they said they would work on it. My husband drove my son and I home to wait there because we couldn't waste any more of our day sitting in the car. When he went back the food was ready, once we opened it up at home they skimped us big time only gave us 2 tiny shriveled spicy chicken strips on one of the orders. Total rip off and complete waste of time! I go to the location in Paseo Nuevo often and have never seen such a dirty, disorganized, and poorly managed restaurant. Avoid it like the plague there's a reason it has such bad reviews."

Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,Andrew litty made fire bowl four me and he's such a good worker he made me feel so happy and his sweet eyes made me get butterflies
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I came here today for some good comfort food in the lonely dark ages of isla vista. Instead what I got was some sick, demented kind of prank that turned the land of gumdrop rainforests and chocolate rivers into my worst nightmare. 
I walk in 30 minute line, which is not their fault.
What is their fault is my cream cheese rangoons with no fucking cream cheese in them. I pay a premium for a warm fluffy dollop of cream cheese encapsulated in a crispy puff pastry but what I get is a lukewarm soggy fried ball sack with nothing but a wisp of the creamy cheese that belongs there. This is not ok.
One star for good vibes"
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,positive,Jayson was very friendly and helpful. Panda Express in Goleta is lucky to have such a great employee.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"I will start off by saying I go here 3 - 4 times a month, and have been for the past few years. I keep hoping one day it will get better. Today was officially the last time I go here. 

Customer service is absolutely horrible here. They know who I am when I walk in, and you'd think they'd treat me with some type of respect and be nice. Maybe a 'hey welcome back!' ... I am here once a week. 

They know I get a 3rd entree every time, so the scoops of food are smaller than normal. I watch people get served in front of me with heaping scoops. Come my turn, it is approx 1/2 the amount. One time, I got 'too much' orange chicken, so Phuong put a piece back. Yes, scooped a piece of chicken off of my plate, and back into their bowl... ridiculous. 

The pre packaged teriyaki sauce and COLD sweet and sour, are also a miss. I have to get 3 cups of sweet and sour to equal one cup. I pour all 3 cups into 1. And it still doesn't overflow. 

Today I had my final straw. I asked for a water cup after getting barely enough food to fill me up (yes I got 3 entrees), and Phuong looked at me so confused. I said, 'can I get a cup for water please?' She says, it's in the bag. I said, no? And double checked... she still didn't believe me I didn't have a water cup yet. So she walks around the cash register, completely stopping the flow of traffic, and searches my bag for a water cup... I'm sorry?? What? 

This is the last time I go here. So Phuong and whoever else works here who doesn't like me, enjoy not seeing me ever again. 

With all that being said, Panda has great food if you time it right. Otherwise, you are getting stale orange chicken that is no longer orange. It is brown. 

Thank you for reading my review. And management, if you see this, please do something about it. I am just a single customer I know, but there are plenty of people who are not happy with the service at this location."
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,The staff here are very rude.  In particular one guy named Beck who had a horrible attitude toward me and my 4 year old daughter.  After I was treated poorly by the workers here I asked to talk to the manager and Beck told me there is no manager.  Because of how rude the workers are I will never go to this location again.  Also my friend once saw a cockroach in the chow mein here.  Avoid this location.
Ak_vHsHsYRP928VHVRL_tQ,Panda Express,Chinese,negative,"If I could give them zero stars I would. Every time I go there they literally have none of their main items. This place is notorious for asking ""would you like to wait 10 more minutes for fried rice"" lol. Absolutely ridiculous I can't stand that this location. Poor time management tied along with poor quality and small portion sizes.. avoid this location at all costs."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"I had expected a lot more from Madame Lu's because it had been rated real high. Inside I noticed alot of clutter behind the cashier desk and the buffet is out of site of the seating which I didn't like because I like to see what's going on. I ordered the pork chop suey and it came with fried rice, a wonton and an egg roll. The pork chop suey was so bland. I had to actually add salt and then soy sauce to it. I have never ever had to add salt to Chinese food! The fried rice was disgusting. It was dark brown, greasy, bland and unappetizing. Again with the salt and soy sauce! There were no peas or egg in it. I had expected a much lighter looking rice with bright veggies in it. The won ton had just a little tiny bit of filling in it and the egg roll was mostly cabbage. The egg rolls at Jack in the Box are much better! My mother and I think that they were too lazy to make a fresh new plate and instead got the food from the buffet. The food was not hot and steamy when we got it. It was just warmed as if it had been sitting around. My mom's tea was not hot at all. No one came to check on us until they presented us with the bill. I told the owner/manager that I did not like the food and I wasn't going to pay for mine. I had barely eaten anything. Not even all of the egg roll. She was mad at me. We sat and waited so my mom could get a box to take home to my dad who will eat anything just about, but we were given dirty looks and ignored so we went to pay at the front where​ I said we were waiting for a box but the cashier ignored that request. We will never return there again. I would like to give this place a half of a star instead of a full one. Don't waste your money there."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Madame Lu has the best Chinese food. The owner is really nice, the food is great and always comes fast. The lunch buffet is good but the dinner menu is amazing. I would recommend 3 cup chicken and the sizzling rice soup."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"Place is decent. Portions are a little small for the prices they charge. $10+ for won ton soup that barely gets 4 people a small cup each, and the broth was darker and saltier than it should be. The rest of the food tasted good but again, portions were a little on the small side. 

Service was good. Kept filling our waters and food came out very quick. 

Will have to try out their lunch buffet.

Definitely recommend the Sesame Chicken"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Really enjoyed the food here. We order the fried cheese wontons, shrimp fried rice, sesame ginger chicken, and shrimp in the black bean sauce. All the dishes were fantastic and delicious. Everything came out all fresh and hot. The atmosphere and ambiance needs a little work."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"This has the BEST kung pao chicken in santa barbara, you have it ask for it ""chinese stlye"" but it is legit! I have tried all the other chinese places and this by far has the best dishes!"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,Had a business trip in 2013 and decided to give this place a try. In a nutshell food was great!  BUT came  today expecting to have the same quality taste and the food was not good at all. I ordered the Mongolia beef and the meat was extremely dry and lacked flavor. The fried rice was also extremely dry and hard to chew.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"We were so disappointed with the food, which was flavorless and in general low quality. The chicken in the dish we had was grisly -- totally a no go for me and the General Tao didn't have enough sauce to go around. We'd rather go to Panda Express for a third of the cost."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,Madam Lu's was amazing I had a great lunch while I was working the service was exceptional
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,Good service. Average level food. Quiet place.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"Don't eat here if you appreciate good food. I dined at this establishment with my family during the lunchtime buffet. Over all; the food was cold, service was odd as there was a worker (not our waitress) that kept staring at our table (she was no-kidding sitting on the table next to us just staring), and the selection was surprisingly limited for a ""buffet"". Dessert was weird as it included canned peaches, flan, jello, and watermelon (not quite the Chinese-food experience). I'll never eat at this establishment again."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Madame Lu is the best!  and I'm not just saying that because we share the same last name!  This is authentic Chinese food in the heart of Santa Barbara.  This nice thing is that all us asians know each other and you can always ask them politely to make something off the menu.  They are super accommodating and you can even bring your own fresh fish or whatnot for them to cook for you!
Always do family style and honestly, the menu is way better than the buffet.
My favorites- chicken fried rice, Peking duck, and the lobster in fruit salad.  (We literally will order one fried rice to go to eat later)  Also the mayonnaise shrimp with walnuts and any fish.  Super delicious, friendly staff and owner, and cleanliness!  Come by and let madame Lu show you what great Chinese food tastes like!"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"We came here about 530.  Kinda a hole in the wall.  I'd guess they only have maybe 16-20 items and none of the pans were full but everything tasted fresh....they do a high turnover in the kitchen so the food doesn't sit out on the line for hours like some places.  Food tasted like someone's Mom was in the kitchen....loving it.  Lots of Asians eating in there and they were eating off the buffet....good sign.  Bathroom was super clean....another good sign.  Heard no spanish in the kitchen, just asian(couldn't pick out the language)....another good sign.  I saved this place to my GPS."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"I've never been to the restaurant, but have ordered delivery a few times. They are easily the best Chinese food in Santa Barbara that I've had. The sauce is a good blend of sweet and savory, good meat portions, and delicious chow mein (wide rice noodles). Usually very quick delivery and never had any issues. 

Highly recommended."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Highly recommend. I ordered beef hot pot, as I have visited Chongqing many times. And the flavor was pretty spot on. Just the right combo of oil, peppers, and spices.  Plus the service was excellent and the restaurant is nicely decorated!"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Okay, I do not understand why this restaurant is rated so poorly.  Ever since I waited an hour to order my food at Red Pepper, I was on the prowl for new Chinese restaurant.  Lo and behold, my friend Sara brought me here.  She ordered off the Chinese menu for me and bam! Those dishes were the best dishes I ever had!  I had fish in hot pot (shui zhu yu) and mei kei kai rou (a pork belly dish).  The fish in hot pot was perfect! The more you eat, the more intense the spicy level gets.  The Mei Kei Kai Rou pork was so tender and rich in taste.  When I brought my family here, the pork was the biggest hit and its hard to please my parents!  My dad ate half the pork plate!  I have been introducing my friends to this place so far as well.  All of them have really enjoyed it.  My ex roommate order the curry beef and chow mein...that curry beef was so delicious.  The beef was tender and the appropriate spice level was there.  The curry was delicious and it was spot on.  My best friend ordered the beef stew with noodles.  I had a taste of it and boy, did it take me back to my mom's cooking!  The stew was rich in taste and nothing else needed to be added.  The beef was so tender and delicious.  I haven't had beef like that in such a long time!  Prices here are pricier because IT IS Santa Barbara.  The portions to us were just right.  All of us didn't understand why so many yelpers were complaining about portions.  If you guys want to be fatasses for larger portions then alright.  These complaints about portions make me realize why obesity in America is such an issue.  AHEM!  My advice...Go for the dishes that aren't commonly found in fast food take out menu in Chinese restaurants (ie. Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour Pork etc.) I once had a deep fried spicy fish dish here and it was the spiciest thing I had in Santa Barbara.  Its not on the menu but TRY.  Be adventurous and go for it!  

P.S....to @Richelle O....if you have a problem with the shark fin soup...SHUT THE F*&CK UP! This is a review for restaurant's experience, not a poster board for you activism or beliefs..  If you have a problem, then don't eat here.  Take it elsewhere and leave yelpers to decide for themselves.  Don't be a downer...not that you already aren't B%$CH."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,Good but you can tell the microwaves in the kitchen are getting a workout! Food was microwave hot and had a taste of being refrigerated and reheated. Big eaters go here for the Buffet.  Left me wondering if there something better!
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"The buffet is really a good deal... me and my husband went there to have lunch n it was a great experience. They have imperial shrimp which is my favorite, orange peel chicken, egg roll, etc.  The hot and sour soup was very good. We will be back."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"If I could give it zero stars, I would for this experience. We've come here about 4-5 times and had been pretty satisfied with our meals, that's why we went back. This visit was really bad. We ordered the tea smoked duck but they brought us ham/pork. They wrapped it individually in the crepes but the first bite revealed what it was. We even told our waitress that this seems like pork, it smelled like it and even the muscle fibers and fat that ran through the meat was indicative of pork. It tasted like a honey baked ham. She insisted it was duck. Maybe they were out of duck and served us something that could pass as it. Really, it insulted our intelligence. Then, I noticed a short black hair in one of our other dishes. Gross. Not going back."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,Food was just ok. We ordered from the menu and the soup was so so so salty and beef was so over cooked hard.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"We've been going here for 15 years and have watched it go steadily down hill for the last 6-7.  In fact, we stopped going here regularly and only show up here when we forget how bad the last time was.  Tonight reminded us again that we swore never to come back.  Bad food and bad service.  The worst experience yet and hopefully our last."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"This is one of our favorite places to eat because of their delicious food but friendly folks as well. We tend not to deviate from our comfort foods (pork hot pot, fish hot pot, pork belly) because they are just so good."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,Their service is pleasant and a little slow. The food is very good and authentic.  4 stars because they do not have Hunan Beef but I will eat there again next time I'm staying in Santa Barbara.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"This was some of the worst Chinese style food we've had in a long time. The Kung Pao chicken was prepared with bland chili paste and no chili peppers.  It was supposed to contain water chestnuts which they substituted with some cheap white radish.

The cashew chicken was so bad it provided amusement. It was the same base as the Kung Pao (cubed chicken tossed with prepared chili paste) but the vegetables were frozen mixed vegetables; those tiny cubes of carrot with equal parts peas and yellow corn. It was literally just thawed from a frozen mix. And yellow corn does not evoke Chinese traditional cooking.

As we were leaving we saw a table near the entrance piled with fresh green beans ready for stringing, so clearly they do purchase and prepare some fresh vegetables. If you have to eat here be sure to quiz the server on the ingredients in each dish. Perhaps they have one or two menu items they actually prepare fresh each day."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,The manager is super nice and enjoys getting to know her customers. She always comes to see how we are doing. 3 stars because the food is only deserving of 3 stars compared to Asian food in LA.  Lunch buffet is only 10.75!
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"The orange chicken was wayyyyyy, WAY too sweet. I felt sick eating it after a few minutes and simply gave up. 

The rice tastes like what rice should taste like. Nice and sticky in the pot. 

Overal, 2/5."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"We found Madam Lu's in the AAA guide while on our way to LA and San Diego.  We were handed a very unappealing dinner menu: sweat and sour everything.  So we asked for the Chinese menu.  That did the trick.  

The food was superb.  The owner gossiped in Taiwanese like she were still living in Taiwan.  It's hilarious.  We revisited Madam Lu's a few years later, on the way to SD and on the way back. It still served the same wonderful food.

Remember, ask for the real menu.  Try the noodle soups."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Very good food! Very reasonable!
We wanted to go to the Lunch Buffet but we were too late (we came at 2:40.  The Buffet usually closes at 2:30) but they still had Lunch specials which were very reasonable. We had two different kinds of chicken, both were served with an eggroll, a fried wonton,  fried rice and sauces.  It was very delicious and we paid 20$ for all that food. Absolutely amazing! The Service was also very nice and friendly."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"Not great.  Wouldn't recommend.
Our order was:
Chicken lo-mein.  It was great.
Chicken fried rice.  Also fantastic.
Sesame chicken.  Below average.  Fried but not really much sauce or flavor to speak of.  Reminded me of pre fried chicken pieces we've gotten from Sam's Club.
Orange sauce chicken.  Same as the sesame chicken.  Pretty bland.
Chicken in curry sauce.  It was decent.

Large portions to accommodate the slightly higher than average prices, so decent value proposition."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,Very very unsatisfied with their customer service ! I was very disappointed because I waited 40 mins. In my car for the restaurant to open. Reason why I waited so long was because I had heard good things about this place and I was willing to try it out. The ladies there are so rude and I felt discriminated. To top it off I was from out of town nowhere near Santa Barbara. Crappy place to ever eat at! They need to better their customer service. I for sure will NOT recommend it to any of my friends or family !
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"After reading all the good reviews, we chose this place for dinner. We ordered Three Flavor Soup for $6.96,Twice Cooked Pork for $10.95, and Shrimp with Spinach for $15.95.
The service was excellent, the soup was delicious. The twice Cook Pork was okay but the Shrimps in the ""Shrimps with Spinach"" was not fresh. We wouldn't go back to this restaurant."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"The food is a awesome. One of the few restaurants in the coast that will do not only vegetarian but vegan as well.
Both the vegan and the meat eater think the food to be the best Chinese food on the central coast."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"I went here one night on a whim b/c I drive by this place all the time. Honestly, from the outside, it looked like it's probably never busy and more than likely a front of some sort. This place has parking behind it - which is a plus.

I figured since I was being so adventurous - I would order things I normally wouldn't. 

I tried the curry wontons (addictive - came out super hot and crunchy, even my picky eater had some). I about DIED when I tried their Preserved Vegetable and Pork Soup. The soup was flavorful, the vermicelli noodles were perfectly tender (not too hard and not too mushy), and the pork and preserved veggies were a great medley of deliciousness in my mouth. I unfortunately couldn't stop eating the soup (I ordered the large with the intention of having some for lunch the next day). I overate and couldn't even fathom eating my entree.

The entree - was a chow fun - unfortunately - this was a dud. I like my noodles a little dryer - having it super greasy/oily just doesn't make me want to eat it. Maybe it would have been tastier had I ate it at the table instead of saving it for lunch the next day. The noodles were just too wet and greasy for me.

I have since gone back and picked up lunch - very clear that most of their business is done during lunch. The place was PACKED and people were lined up like they were giving food away. I guess lunch buffets really brings people out?!?

Anyways - highly recommend their curry wonton and soup. Their Kung Pao Tofu was a little over spiced for me but I think it would be good for anyone who likes super spicy food. I'm eager to try a few other things from their menu! Yum!"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"What a special find for Christmas dinner ! Driving down state street on Christmas Day was becoming worrying, mum and I were starving and nothing seemed to be open. Madam Lu caught my eye and I saw the open sign so we went for it. 
Arriving around 430 the staff were setting up for dinner, no big crowds at this point but quite a few people still dining. 

Our server was really awesome, she was well-spoken and confident. The decor was old but cozy, it was just perfect for a hot dinner on a special day. 
The best part about the menu is the amount of vegan options they have ! I would have never expected a Chinese restaurant to be so accommodating to a vegan diet, my mum was stoked. 
I ordered the Beef Basil and my mum ordered the Vegan Kung Pao Chicken. 
My beef basil was so delicious, the onions were to die for and it was so garlicy. My mum liked hers, she didn't rave about it but she ate most of it and took the rest home. 

Closer to 530 the restaurant was completely packed and I totally understand why, it was delicious. Feeling lucky we found this place on a whim !"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,Very good food. The owner takes pride of ownership. The chicken noodle soup is so good. I've seen the kitchen before and it is very clean and organized.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Pretty good chinese on upper state street. Have eaten in and ordered for delivery, it has always been good as far as it goes. Quiter setting for a little date night. Owners are friendly as are the staff and the restaraunt is clean and orderly unlike a few of the local spots. Good local reputation overall and track record for good reason."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Delicious steamed fish filet with slivered green onions in Chinese  wine sauce, not available everywhere. Good fried wonton. Good fresh noon buffet. Always friendly and will serve you even if near closing time. Interesting decor with original art work."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"woman in glasses standing in the center of the room and talking loudly in Chinese customers, so I can`t eat my food indigestible when standing over me and say loudly and logo in my ear !! I understand it was the landlady, she was not polite, relaxed and cultured!"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,We love madam lu restaurant! Great food and friendly service...
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,No more Madam Lu for me.  I used to think the food was really good here.  But the last order of Orange Chicken (something my kids will eat) and string beans was horrible.  The orange chicken at Panda Express tastes better and is 1/3 the price.  Madam Lu serves chicken that is dry and tasteless.  The green beans were obviously frozen and went straight to the trash.  What a waste of money.  This place is not the same as it used to be.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Very good food, but it's all hidden on the Chinese only menu. I'm not Chinese, so I had to show them pictures from Yelp from Madam Lu and Mama Lu's. They were able to make everything i showed them from yelp, which wasn't on the English Chinese menu. Someone should really tell these guys to include some of the items from the Chinese menu on the American menu. For example, I had a light soup with pea shoots, bamboo, pork and enoki mushrooms. It was Delicious but it's not on the English menu."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"Maybe I'm spoiled by the wonderful Chinese food we get here in Southern California... but Madam Lu? Really. This place could not have been more of a disappointment. My boyfriend and I wanted some incredible Chinese while visiting our friends at UCSB. We saw Madam Lu's while driving around and decided to stop because it looked like a place to get authentic Chinese, and there were tons of cars in the parking lot. Sat down and were given menus and cold tea... that I'm assuming was suppose to be hot? Boyfriend ordered a full war-wonton soup that was about 10 dollars.. I've never paid that much money for something so small. I wanted something with chicken so I asked if the chicken chop suey was prepared with whitemeat.. and they said no, only one entree is prepared with white meat and that is the chicken and broccoli. I was shocked because all items were priced 11-15 dollars in the chicken section. ELEVEN dollars for a plate of chicken thigh? Boyfriend got pork lo chow mein.. his final comment was ""Panda is better"". Two men waited on us. One man was nice but the other was just unpleasant to be around. I would really like to show anyone who wrote a positive review about this place what true, incredible Chinese food is. 

Over priced. Bad service. Poor quality food. 

Next time we want Chinese in SB, we'll check YELP before we go."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,Has been a long since I have been here. Came a few weeks ago for a quick lunch and was not disappointed. The food was good and the service was descent.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"Finally, a decent chinese restaurant in SB.  We went here for a going away dinner and was able to try a number of dishes and we actually walked away satisfied.  Much more than what I can say for the other chinese places in SB. 

I only regret we didn't get the 3-cup chicken -- a true taiwanese dish -- yum! 

Prices are fair and the service very polite.  Another plus is that the deco isn't the annoying cloying pink, or mauve that most chinese restaurants seem to like to use."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,Bomb Crispy Chicken with Garlic Sauce and Beef Kung Pow.  Eggroles and won ton soup also good.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,Best Chinese food whenever wife and I visit Santa Barbara.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Props to our current goto delivery chinese restaurant in Santa Barbara area.  Also a good, classic atmosphere for dine-in, can get a big round table.  My family likes lots of different things- very reliable dishes.  Delivery is quick and great alternative to pizza."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,Reasonable price ! But the food was cold and some chickens are so salty. I had have to drink much water.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,Nice Chinese Place in Santa Barbara and great service
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"I've been going to Madam Lu since summer 2011 because I live near by and I have always gotten good service and great food. Not sure what was going on when all these other reviewers got there, but my tea has always been hot, my soup has always been delicious, and the Chicken Chow Mien that I almost always order has always been fantastic. 

It's my favorite Chinese food in all of Santa Barbara."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"Mostly Americanized Chinese food high in MSG and definitely overpriced. Some of the food is quite good though. If you want REAL Chinese food, you can't find it in Santa Barbara, try San Gabriel."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"This place is amazing. I don't understand the low-star reviews, but I notice that the majority of them are from people that live in places where you can get cheaper food. This is Santa Barbara, like it or not, stuff is expensive. This place's pricing is on par with any other Chinese restaurant in town, and the food is better.

The owner is a wonderful woman and the entire staff has crazy memories and know who everyone in my entire family is and what everyone likes. When I had my son, they begged me to bring him so they could see him. Just nice people. 

The food is wonderful. Not greasy and well made. If they ever make a mistake they apologize, give you the extra dish, and make it right in no time. People that complain about the buffet being empty: sometimes they have a hard time keeping up, they cook in extremely small batches, which keeps the food fresh and the quality higher than if it was sitting on a steam table for half an hour straight. I agree it can be annoying, but just ride it out. Dang."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"wowowow. this place was upsetting.
everything looked nice but it was all a trick!
the food was gross. salty chow mein, disgusting sesame chicken.
my friend ordered a coke and got a glass 3/4 full and 90% of that was ice.  his coke was a light light brown. it was saddening.
+1 for nice setting
+1 for helpful service
+1 for decent dumplings
-1 for gross chow mein
-1 for gross sesame chicken
+1 because i'm nice."

eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,Best Chinese food in town! This place keeps me coming back every time I eat here. Best staff with such amazing food! I absolutely LOVE Madam Lu's!!!
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Cost ~ dollar more per offering but the portions are much larger than Mandarin Palace who won't include soup in your take out order unless you bring your own container!  A recent dinner there - the $14.99 all inclusive dinner - garlic pork - was delicious and I had enough for a midnight snack and lunch the next day..... they are a bit timid with really spicy food, tho."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"We go there for the Lunch Buffet as often as we can. This place is outstanding. I have nothing but good things to say about the food and the great service. I am treated like I am part of their extended family when I am there. Just a great place all the way around. I have also ordered off the menu for dinner and the food is the same high quality every time too. Service is excellent. We are always given a table right away and the drinks and or water glasses are never empty.
Get over to Madam Lu's and try their great food."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"I think this is the best in SB. The Chinese menu is the one of the most authentic. Madame Lu does not fool around. Meaning, she runs a tight operation but she is generous when you get to know her. Try the Dou Miao 豆苗( pronounced dough meow), or Kong Xin Tsai  空心心脏蔬菜 (pronounced kong shin sigh) for a really delicious vegetable dish that most American palates will relish. This place is easy and casual with no ""who's who of Hollywood types."""
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,Very bad place. People why work hire don't speak English. Food is bad . No choice of food.
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Madam Lu's is the best chinese food I have found in Santa Barbara.  Good size portions, friendly service, lot of seating and great food!"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"My family came here for some authentic Chinese food. They have a parking lot next to the restaurant, which is great. We walked in and the staff seated us politely and quickly. The decor is okay, nothing that special. What was really disappointing was the food.

First of all, the food is overpriced. $15 an entree is a bit too much for me. I might be used to lower priced food, but that's still pricey. Since we were all hungry, we decided to order a set meal that included soup, appetizer, and a couple of entrees.

Although the food was hot when it came out, it was awful. The wonton soup tasted like soy sauce and water mixed together (which shouldn't even be considered soup). Wontons were bland. The chow mein and beef were too salty. I had to mix the chow mein with the rice just to even out the flavor. The sweet and sour chicken was too sour. The egg rolls was the only thing that were good (crispy and had good flavor). The total came out to $60. All that money for food we didn't even like.

The problem with this restaurant is that the food isn't real, authentic Chinese food.  They Americanized it too much. Not only that but its pricey. Because of that, I think it only deserves 2 stars, mainly for service and parking. 

I wouldn't come here again."
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,positive,"Solid Chinese food. Great takeout & delivery. Madame Liu is always around. Best lunch buffet in SB. Try the sizzling rice soup, chow fun, or the happy family special!"
eukRpR47MDH4XXfU_Dul9Q,Madam Lu,Chinese,negative,"It's clean and well lighted.  It has a menu filled with standard Chinese restaurant dishes.  We ordered four dishes for the two of us.  There was a considerable wait until the first dish arrived.  And then a VERY long wait until two more were served.  The fourth dish, a main dish for my wife, NEVER arrived!  The server forgot to bring us water.  We had a long struggle to get any server to bring another bottle of beer.

One dish, shrimp chow mein, had an acceptable taste.  The other two dishes had bland, 'off' flavors.  We've eaten in Chinese restaurants all over the US and Canada, and never had such ""blah"" food.  Definitely a place we won't return to."
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"Impressive all around!

The Good Stuff (food):
Everything was delicious, and their selection of noodles/broths/add-ins is incredible! They had an appetizer which I BELIEVE is called ""Popping Fish Balls"" which sounds way more gross than it really is, since it was amazing and I highly recommend giving it a try!
Each pot had several 'treasures' inside of them including fried tofu, half an egg, seafood and more!
Their ""Phresh"" teas, though not the very best I have ever had, were definitely better than some others I have had in the surrounding areas.


Non-Food related:
My sister/brother-in-law were visiting, and none of us had ever been to a hot-pot place before, but the staff was extremely accommodating! We were given an in-depth explanation of everything, and there was quite a lot you need to know, but in truth it was very simple.
My family brought their dog, and the restaurant allowed us to become the very first to sit outside - they even took pictures for their wall!
-Since we were outside, they cooked the meat beforehand, though I believe if you sit inside then the meat is cooked in your soup!-

Overall, we had a great experience, and considering the restaurant opened only a month before we went there, I'd say that this is definitely an important gem to try in our community here in Goleta!"
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,This is properly my favorite hotpot and milk tea place in Goleta! Their phresh tea is the best with a reasonable price! I have been here for a few times and the food there are so delicious. The staffs here are helpful and friendly! I would definitely recommend everyone to come try it out!!!!!
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"First time there, Francesca was super helpful and sweet!!!!  We spoke w a few of the servers and they were all very nice and helpful!  We enjoyed are meal and look forward to going back."
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,negative,"If laying on your bed squirming in pain like u just drank bad water in India, don't eat the numbing hot pot"
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"The greatest hot pot store in SB! Today I ordered one to go but they might be to busy and gave me a wrong one. However, when I called their store, the manager delivered to me the right one because I don't have a car. Their customer facing skills definitely worth the visit. And the food are so great!"
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,Food was very full of flavor :) We ordered to go and got some rice bowls. I got the sechuan Beef and it was super tender and packed full of yummy taste! Would love to go try their soup pot someday for sure!
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"The boba and milk tea are bomb. I found a lot of the things on the menu looked questionable, but when my boyfriend and I ventured out, we found that we really liked the interesting-looking meals! I'd say you have to give this place a try. It's fun and new. Oh, and the service is spectacular! They have a very fun and upbeat staff :)"
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"Fun and delicious! You can ask for the meat to come already cooked, if you don't want the open flame going :) 

I ordered the numbing broth which was a mistake for me. I will try a different one next time. 

The servings are huge. The side order is an entire plate of mushrooms which are great but you could probably share. 

FYI- these dishes have seafood in them (the menu doesn't explain this) so be careful if you have allergies"
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"Fun hot pot place that shares a storefront with a boba restaurant. The service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure everything was going as planned. We purchased two hot pots and loved the display. Both dishes were tasty and cooked quickly on the sterno cans. Affordable with lots of options. Menu was a little challenging to figure out, but wait staff cleared up all questions. Go check it out! Ordered boba as dessert to go. Forgot the straw. Ugg. Tea was delicious though."
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,negative,"Restaurant look clean and nice.
The food is just ok. The Exceptional hot pot was little blank. I expected little more flavor in the broth. Hopefully they will change next time."
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,negative,"For one this is the best hot pot in sb, but only
because of the limited options and places to eat Asian food in sb in general. However I find the food add ons overpriced (packed ramen noodles for  2.50, 2.95 for only a few extra pieces of enoki mushroom?) and only some of the hotpots taste good. There are also inconsistencies of the quality and content of the hot pots each time I come, even though I mostly order the same items each time. They mostly use cabbage as a filler and the actual amount in the hotpot is very little.  The service is also abysmal. Some of the waitresses are attentive and nice, but more often than not a lot of the service is dismissive and rude. The owner is also more attentive to some customers compared to others (the international customers who can speak Chinese) and doesn't attend to or pay any attention to other customers. The customer service overall is offputting. The drinks I find to be subpar and overly sweet. Overall I wouldn't eat here unless you're craving hotpot and have no where else to go. 




EDIT: 

The last time I went I found a piece of meat in my hotpot that I asked to be vegetarian. When asked with no cabbage, my hot pot came with an abysmal amount of food: only 3 cubes of tofu, 3 pieces of wood ear mushrooms , 2 small bundles of noodles, and 2 pieces of lotus root. There was also no enoki mushrooms this time when they usually put at least a little. I understand using cabbage as a filler but the amount you get for what you pay is absolutely pathetic. It makes customers buy add ons and the end result is paying $20+ for a mediocre hot pot"
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"Really great food, good service, but if you've never had hot pot, bring somebody who has and they can teach you."
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"Highly recommended! I Came here with my Gf and we loved the food. It's so delicious! We ordered pepper pork feet, Tomato hot soup pot with beef slice, and angus beef Teppanyki, the taste of them are just amazing! Staffs are friendly and the manager was very helpful to recommend the foods to us. I will definitely come again with my family and friends."
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,negative,"This my third time visit to this new place and met a strange white old lady waitress really annoy me. When I ordered the drink she said ""no you can't order it ."" I don't know why she could say that, which I felt completely offended and don't thins that's funny at all. 
The first two times visits with other Asian waitress was a pleasant ."
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,negative,Apparently I walked in the wrong door and they told me to walk in through the boba shop next door which apparently is connected to the restaurant. It took awhile before anyone asked how many people in my party. I had to walk up the boba cashier to ask if I was in the right area. They took our order and my husbands food came out way before mine to the point of him being almost finished. I asked for a taro boba to go and she came back with it in a mason jar. My drink was watery so I didn't bother taking the rest home. Service was ok.
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"Ridiculously fun and delicious experience! Do make sure to go when you have time to really sit and enjoy, as it is not an in and out place."
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"i've only been to two hot pot places and this one is by far my favorite!! the portions are generous and they give you a lot of food to add to your hot pot! the flavors are rich and fulfilling! will come again and recommend the place to my friends! 
our hot pots took more than 30 minutes to be ready but the owner offered us 5% off :)"
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,"FREAKING DELICIOUS!!! I've only had hot pot once or twice before, so when my hubby & I were looking for lunch spots while visiting family in Goleta, we jumped at the chance to try this place. And we are so glad we did! He had the Korean jjigae stew with udon, and I had the veggie lover's hot pot with the Szechuan pepper broth, which was spicy but not crazy spicy. Mine came with various mushrooms, corn, cabbage, tofu, & konnyaku, with vermicelli on the side. I also got the lamb add-on, 5 thin slices of lamb which you cook right in the hot, bubbling broth. The bowls sit over lit sterno, so they stay bubbling hot, but the servers are happy to take em it off for you if it's too hot. It can get a little messy, so be forewarned! 

You get four different sauces, two spicy, one soy-garlic, and one sesame-peanut. We liked the chili bean one. You get a little bowl, the idea is to put some sauce in the little bowl and swipe your veggies/ meat through the sauce. But because it's all so hot, we found the best way to eat is to place a few pieces of food in the little bowl so it can cool down some first. Worked for us!

The servers were all very nice & accommodating, explaining the menu and making recommendations. The tables have a button you can press whenever you need anything, which was very convenient. I asked to have my leftovers packed to go, and the server even added extra broth, which was very thoughtful. 

We got there on the early side for lunch, and the place filled up fast, so get there early! 

Would return & Highly recommend!"
2RtyOlU9mwyVisvgOECaDA,Uniboil,Chinese,positive,Just had lunch with my body. They all loved it. We basically come here every other day. This is the only hot pot place I don't need to drink a lot water after my meal. Rocks!!!
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,It's so exciting to have a new noodle place in town! If you love noodles this is a nice change from Pho and very reasonably priced. Plus you get to pick your noodle toppings. So happy to hear they're going to have many good beer options. Beer would go perfect with the pork belly or popcorn chicken buns! Great meal and snack options. Will be back soon!
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,I bought a large pork rib bowl and it only has two piece of pork ribs. I though the difference between of regular and large should be the portion of meats as well. But it just has more rice in the large one. I would rather to spending same amount of money to buy a large popcorn chicken in wake up cup
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"This is the first Chinese noodle soup place in town. Speaking as someone who is Chinese, it's nice to see an authentic Chinese noodle soup place here. Food is good, especially those buns with pork belly. I think the bun is more like Taiwanese style. I've seen them on TV before but never had tried. Yes, It's delicious."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Everyone knows Isla Vista lacks decent Asian restaurants, so I was pretty excited when I discovered Lao Wang. I tried one of each of their different boas and I was honestly so impressed. The pork belly is definitely my favorite since it pairs so nicely with the fluffy bun. I look forward to trying the noodles next!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Really convenient location and great for colder days! Two days ago, I got their spicy mala noodle soup with beef tendons, tofu, and fish tofu. They have self serve peanut sauce that tastes like authentic dipping sauces I've gotten in LA. They also have spicy chili oil but I didn't like that as much. There's also spicy mayo and sriracha that I didn't get. I ordered rice noodle and when they brought it out, the noodles were undercooked. I brought it back to the counter and they quickly made me another bowl. Great customer service!! 

Today, I was in a rush so I ordered a curry chicken rice which was yummy. However, the portion size was quite small. The chicken meat itself was well seasoned and the curried vegetables were yummy as well. They also include two slices of yellow pickled radish which added a nice crunch to the rice set."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Love, love, love this place!!!! 50 percent of pitchers of beer and the BEST noodle bowls in Santa Barbara! Beyond fair in price! This place is a don't miss. I recommend if you like spice the spicy broth."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"I had a ""create your own"" noodle bowl with meat and veggies.  I also had the popcorn chicken and the pork belly bao.  The food was great.  It was nice to eat food that was tasty and healthy!  The service was also fast even though they were busy.   I will definitely go back for more!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Finally a place in SB that serves baos! I went there with not so much expectations because I've had really good baos from other places like Momofuku and Baohaus in NY.
 
I tried all three baos -  pork belly, chicken popcorn, and the Chinese sausage and I would say that it is fantastic!  The Chinese sausage and chicken popcorn are my favorite, the pork belly however needs a little salting and  was too greasy and the bun soaked up most of the oil that I ended up not eating the entire thing. 

Their lunch special is pretty affordable however it's interesting how French fries is included in the combo!

Overall I would say that this place is pretty decent, I could see how this place gets busy during peak hours (considering that it is in a college town), fortunately it wasn't that bad when we went. I would come back to this place just to try their noodles."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,The sweet potato fries here are bomb. I have tried the vegan bowl which was kind of bland tbh but I love the vegan option and there's a lot of great toppings. Sweet place to stop when doing the loop.
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"The waiter messed up my order completely, giving me spam and beancurd with ma la when I had ordered bok choy and beef and the original soup base. So I brought it back but got SPAM and BEANCURD again (but no ma la) :(((((((((((((( I hate spam and beancurd. also this place is overpriced.


update: I GOT DA RUNS"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"I have been here multiple times while trying various items on the menu. Needless to say I am always pleased with the food and fast-paced & friendly service! You can't go wrong with the craft your own noodles since there are many various toppings, soup bases, and noodles to select from-all delicious! The portions of the food at Lao Wang is also great (even the noodles) and are fairly priced considering the amount you get! Five stars for Lao Wang & I will be back again soon!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Broth is on point! Your typical college spot, but the food is delicious. Good portion sizes for the price, but the broth is what makes their product great!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"The rice noodles here is normal level, not good not bad. However, people can drink beer here. It is awesome. I never tried eat rice noodles with beer."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,Not bad for an IV restaurant. I was prepared to be disappointed by their noodle bowls but found I actually really liked the flavor and taste of the broth. We'll see if the taste continues to be consistent if I come back~
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,Their ramen and pork buns are really good. Price is a little bit steep but all in all worth it!
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Had pretty low expectations coming here, but came away pretty impressed! 

I've been holding off trying this place just because I didn't want to be disappointed, since I was spoiled by dozens of authentic, delicious Chinese food being located in every corner of my hometown. While Lao Wang doesn't necessarily outdo any place, it's still pretty good.

Lao Wang can get pretty busy, so depending on when you come, there may or may not be enough seating. Customer service is brief and largely forgettable. There's additional sauces on a table that's self-serve, and the store seems pretty clean overall.

I got the build-your-own noodles, and chose the rice noodles. My friend got the small pork rib rice bowl. First off, the noodles were well cooked. Not terribly soft, not too hard. The soup wasn't too salty, and the spicy option gave the broth just enough of a kick for flavors to be interesting. There's actually a good amount of noodles and toppings to offset the high-ish price. The pork rib was braised just like mom does it at home; flavor is pretty authentic and well done. The rice and veggie part was pretty average, though. 

I can't guarantee that Lao Wang would do well in my hometown given its prices, but compared to everything else in Isla Vista, it's not too expensive. If you can afford to eat in Isla Vista, and you want some Asian food, you should give Lao Wang a try!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,Price is way out of any iv restaurant. Got charged $14 for the special hot n spicy bowl. Ridiculous. On the menu it says 12.95 but I got charged 13.95. Also the hot n spicy bowl was way too oily! Felt like they just made a pork soup base and just added an excess amount of chili oil. Also their portions weren't as big as they should be for the price. Overall another failure of an iv restaurant that fails to cater to its audience.
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"So I haven't had the noodles yet but I have tried the bowls, specifically the pork belly bowl. For me the large is not big at all, but just right. I'm very impressed with the seasoning of the pork, just wish a few more pieces were given. Other than that, I can say that it was a nice first impression and I'll be back for sure!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Lao Wang is great! I ordered the craft my own in hopes of recreating the street food I had while in China and I was not disappointed. Although it's a little pricey for the size, it tasted amazing! The food also arrived very quickly and came with a plethora of condiments."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"As a fan of both spicy food and noodles, I was super excited when this place opened up in Isla Vista! The decor of the restaurant was really nice, and had a nice street market kind of vibe. 

I've been here a few times since it opened, and overall I was pretty impressed by the food, given Isla Vista's reputation for poor Asian food. The broth was very flavorful and not salty at all, which is as really surprising. I ordered the Hot N' Spicy Lunch special which included a free fountain drink. I ordered mine extra spicy, but I felt like it wasn't hot enough. Thankfully they had some chili oil on the condiment tables for you to help yourself. They also have spicy mayo, as well as different seasonings suspended in oil. Overall, the condiment table is a nice touch that allows people to add the finishing touch to their food to their preference.

Definitely will be coming back for more!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Wonderful place for authentic Chinese egg noodle with soup, especially since there aren't any in IV. Ordered and it felt like I got the food within 5 minutes, though I went not when it was rush hours. The portion of noodles and toppings are reasonable for the price and filling. The soup was flavorful. The Chinese sausage can be a little oily, but it was delicious. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great, and the workers were super friendly. A perfect place to grab lunch or dinner."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"I was pleasantly surprised by the food at Lao Wang! I wasn't sure what to expect from this place because Chinese food in Isla Vista is usually pretty mediocre. However, I really enjoyed the bao buns, and I would definitely recommend trying the pork belly one. Overall, I had a great experience here at Lao Wang and will definitely come back again!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,I had a small serving garlic chicken rice bowl here. I have to admit that I am a little bit picky about Chinese food and I think the taste of garlic chicken here is average in comparison with restaurant in China. It seems that the Malatang here is pretty good- the bowl is so large!
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"With a lot of the Asian food in Isla Vista, I go with very low expectations as my past experience with a lot of previous establishments has led me to be skeptical. But Lao Wang was a nice surprise. Though it definitely was not the best Asian food I have ever had, it is definitely much better than mostly anything else I have found in IV. The chicken bowl was pretty tasty and the atmosphere was great as well. It also has a super convenient location, especially if you are living on campus."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"Pretty filling, good place to eat. Price is a little ridiculous. I got the custom noodles for dinner and it set me back about $13 not including tip. Would recommend to try but it's pretty pricey in my opinion."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Forget downtown Santa Barbara! If you want to have some authentic Chinese noodles, this is the place to come. (Parking in I.V. is *slightly* better than it used to be). I got the basic Mala Tang noodles, and the broth was complex and enjoyable, the noodles were cooked perfectly, the fish balls were slightly different flavor than I expected (but good), and topping it off, a heavy dose of Prickly Ash (i.e. Szechuan peppercorn) oil. I love the numbing feeling of the oil..it just makes me want to eat more!! 

I plan to come back and eat my way through the menu.

Decor is funky and wooden and the place is packed with Asian students, always a good sign."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"Honestly am sad that I didn't like the food here. This review is only for their beef belly rice bowl, maybe the other food is better?  I ordered the small beef belly bowl and first off, there was three pieces of meat. Second, it was 90% fat. I know that beef belly is supposed to be a fatty meat but it was not a good fat, it was a bad fat. I'm curious to try their buns and soups, so I'll probably come back but I would not recommend the beef belly bowl.

Friendly service though and not a long wait at all."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Out of all the Asian restaurants in Isla Vista, this place has to be the best. I have heard from my friends that the bao buns were the best and I couldn't agree more. Like everything in Isla Vista is pretty over-price for what we get, but these bao buns were definitely not, considering how good they were (I got the pork buns)!

I tried out the noodles, and let me tell you that they give you quite the amount, awesome portions. They gave me a good anount of chicken, meat balls, and cabbage. The soup actually tasted like how it tasted back home (Orange County, specifically Westminster). This is THE definitely a go-to Asian restaurant in Isla Vista. You can count on me coming back here as a weekly customer. Keep up the good work!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"I'm still here now, but wanted to get my review in before I got distracted. I visited Lao Wang when they were a pop-up in the Goodland Kitchen, and loved their super-spicy soup. I was so excited to see they had their own spot as I passed today, and had to stop in. I got dry rice noodles with chicken and tofu. The sesame sauce was delicious, their chili sauce let's you spice it up as much or as little as you want, and I was so pleased and happy I decided to stop in. I'll definitely be back."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"I really like this place! I had 2 bao buns, one was popcorn chicken and the other was pork belly! They came out super fast, but we're a lot smaller than I expected. They were good though! They have a lot of toppings, but I left mine pretty simple. I'm gonna try the noodles next time for sure. Hopefully by then they have beer too! 
Good stuff, I'll be back!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,Tasty!!! Real Chinese noodles and bun!!!! I haven't eaten this type noodles for long time since I left China! It just made me feel like HOME 太他妈好吃了！
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"Tried it with gf during Grand opening. It's an imitation to authentic Chinese cuisine but not nearly there yet. Pricing aside, the foods just aren't palatable. The noodle is sloppy, tasted like it had been left overnight twice. Soup is bland, simply not enjoyable. We were stoked to hear that a Chinese cuisine restaurant was opening in Isla Vista, but this is a let down. I'd give it a one star, but two for now because improvements can be easily made, and I hope they do."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"I went there three times during last three weeks. I tried craft my own, our own choice, and chili chicken. The price is decent, and food are pretty good, especially compared to most restaurants in IV. Moreover, they have so many good sauces! The chili sauce and peanut butter sauce are the best! 

They serve food really fast, and workers there are very nice and helpful. I will definitely come back for the food and the service!! 

The photo is the chili chicken. I highly recommend!!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"Honestly, this restaurant is the epitome of the term ""average."" Nothing stood out to me and was amazing, yet nothing was that terrible.

I tried the Malatang Hot 'N Spicy and it wasn't the world's greatest thing. It was pretty good, though. I wasn't a big fan of the rice noodles I got, and would probably try a different type next thing I go. I guess I was expecting thinner, vermicelli like noodles, but was confronted with its fatter cousin instead. I recommend mixing everything, so that the flavors blend. I ended up adding a lot more chili oil to my dish to give it more kick.

The type of spicy you get isn't the burn-your-tongue hot cheeto spicy nor is it the burn-your-throat spicy. It's more of a tingly, numbing sensation. Don't be scared if you feel weirdly numb. That's the sichuan peppercorn working its magic.

I appreciate the great condiments bar they have. it's fully stocked with ketchup, sriracha, chili oil, white pepper, vinegar, soy sauce, and prickly ash oil. If you're enticed by the prickly ash oil, don't fret: it's not oil made from the ashes of your enemies. It's just oil infused with sichuan peppercorn.

I also tried the popcorn chicken. It was also just okay. It tastes way better dusted with white pepper. It comes with ranch on the side to dip into, but I like alternating between the ranch and the chili oil. Each give it a different dimension.

Another time, I got two bao: Chinese sausage, and stewed pork belly. Both were good, but not the most filling things. The pork belly was pretty salty, but I really enjoyed the Chinese sausage.

Both baos come with spicy garlic chili sauce smeared inside. In general, almost all the food has some sort of spice to it, whether it's from the peppercorn or from smothering chili sauce on things. I personally like it, but if you're not one to handle it, you can always ask the cashiers. They're really helpful with answering questions. However, the food can take a while to come out.

Overall, I wouldn't completely rule this out if I was deciding on where to eat. However, I don't think I would go for the noodles, as I don't think they're worth their price."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"This has been my latest obsession.

I'm leery of trying any asian food in SB b/c it's all super Americanized, over salted, cooked from frozen or bland. I only gave this a go b/c of groupon and glad I did. 

The noodles were super good, the broth is great, the service is friendly and it's a super chill place to go. Generous portions with their rice bowls. Their buns (all 3) are good too. Oddly - my ultra favorite thing is their spicy mayo for french fries. Their pricing is also very fair - $15 for a giant bowl of noodles and a drink and tip.

I've been guilty of going here 3x a week - only b/c the students aren't back yet. Once they're back - I'll go crawl back into my SB Cave to hibernate."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"I had originally wanted Sorriso Italiano, because that's probably the least oil heavy restaurant in IV. Next would probably be Hana, but the meat quality is near hazardous. So I wanted to try Lao Wang. I got a small garlic chicken bowl, a pretty conservative order. It tasted like heavily salted dog food. It was genuinely terrible. The noodles look way better, so if you were wondering about the chicken bowls, don't hold your breath..."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"It is a good place to go if you are craving Chinese food. On the other hand, it is very pricey. I got noodles with spam, beef, and enoki mushrooms. The thing is I am 80% sure they don't even use actual spam, which already an imitation meat, how are you going to give your customers imitation of an imitation meat when they are paying 14+ for a bowl of noodles. 

Overall, it's meh, but not worth."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"Not sure what the hype about this place is. I ordered the dinner special (13 dollars) with 3 add-ons: Chicken, Beef Tendon, and Beef. I also ordered the Pork Belly Bao (whopping 4 dollars). The portion size is quite small for the expensive pricing with a very mediocre taste. I would say the noodles are something I can make myself at home."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"It's so-so, but could be so much better. This fast food joint focuses on mostly a mix of Chinese food ie Noodles and Baozi Sandwiches, with some random stuff like fries. I had each of the 3 buns they offered, which include the Pork Belly Bao, Popcorn Chicken Bao, and Pork Sausage Bao.

Now the food came out quickly and the texture of both the bun and meats came out nice. The Popcorn chicken and pork sausage both came out as so-so, but for something even less desirable, try the pork belly, which was only slightly more flavorful than tap water. The buns are less oily, but the pork belly and Chicken were cooked with something oily and that texture doesn't leave my mouth very well. From what I saw on the noodles with a friend, it looked way too MSG-ridden with an oily sheen on the top. Anyways, all of them definitely need some work on seasoning or marinade since none of the meats really had any flavor, even with the chili paste.

By themselves overall, the bao buns were not salty nor spicy nor...anything with an actual flavor. For 3 Bao buns, the total came out to be $8.20, which isn't too bad but definitely leaves something to be desired if this is marketed as Asian street food. If the meat had more flavor then I think it would be better justified for the price that they currently have for them."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"I was a little skeptical about the Asian food in IV, so I was pleasantly surprised with my amazing experience at Lao Wang. I love how they've accepted the college town vibes. Also, the girl who took my order was super friendly and helpful.

Definitely recommend the bao buns, they were really good!"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,Over price and flavorless noodle soup. Menu not as good when they were located in old town. Decor hasn't changed since the last restaurant menu is boring nothing unique.
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,Wonderful Korean buns. Friendly service. Just three kind of buns are not enough choices. Not fancy but to the point. Side of Fried curry chicken was my favorite.
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"So continues my quest to find good, solid Chinese food in the area. Lao Wang marketed itself as just ""Asian street food,"" which made me sigh because I thought the entire menu was essentially traditional Chinese food, but hey. It's an edible option.

Came in just before 5 (off-hours) and it took them quite a while to get the food out. While my single stewed pork belly bao was out in two minutes, the friend I went with had to wait for 10 to get a small serving of popcorn chicken dusted with white pepper and a boiled (or deep fried?) Chinese sausage. None were particularly special -- pork belly and sausage were both fatty, and while the popcorn chicken uses dark meat, the portion is about one handful for $6. Bao was nicely cooked but bland.

I found a piece of plastic in my bao, but judging from the rushed/low-key grand opening and lackadaisical attitude of the people behind the counter, I didn't have the motivation to go up to the counter and complain about it. The ma la tang sounded and looked quite a bit like Sichuan dandan noodles with soup, though, and I'd be interested in trying that once they settle down more.

On the bright side, they have a massive condiment section. If you cry when you eat red pepper flakes, though, I'd avoid this place. Even their bao has a small smear of chili paste inside (not that you can taste much, anyway)."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Love the malatang, peanut sauce, and the chili oil! It's a little pricey for what it is but the location is convenient enough for me to be ok with it. Staff are always very friendly. I'm a regular here and can't wait to see this business grow. Maybe another location? :p"
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"I doubt this place will last long but it did the trick for me. But maybe I am just buying into the curse of this location. It's probably seen a dozen businesses int he last 15 years, but I don't count that against the place in the review. I have been several times for lunch. I usually build my own soup. I like the rice noodles the best with the spicy broth. I put one of their oils in my soup once (forgetting the name of it) and it ruined the dish. Made my tongue tingle. Now I just add a little vinegar from the condiment bar. The add-ons for the soup are quite flavorless (quail egg, bok choi, broccoli). I found beef and enoki to be the best combination.

I will try the buns one of these days. On a positive note, they do seem to have good deals on beer."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,Love the buns and pork belly! Solid beer selection and reasonable prices. Right off campus this place is win!
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,The noodle is quite authentic and the pork belly bun is uniquely delicious. I love how the servers are always very nice and helpful. The location is perfect too if you live in IV or are a student of UCSB.
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,negative,"their bowls are too small. I ordered a pork belly bowl and there were two pieces of pork. the rice was bad and there was this weird, bad fruit in it that made it worse. if you go here for beer, go somewhere else for food."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"Good food, friendly price, don't expect high quality of service though. It's the fantastic place for Asian to eat around UCSB if you are tired of American food."
cZ6sHHLv7VSmuFSxP6sQLg,Lao Wang,Chinese,positive,"I've passed by this place multiple times on the way to and from class, and was initially hesitant to try it because the Asian food in IV isn't usually good. I decided to go with a few friends a few days ago and ordered the pork belly bao, and it was actually pretty good! The pork belly was tender and flavorful. The food came out fairly fast and the employees were really nice, so I will definitely come back to try the other baos!"
