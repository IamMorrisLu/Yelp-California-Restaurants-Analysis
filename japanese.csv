DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,So happy I found a bomb local sushi place!! Always ignored this shop going to domino's but I'm so glad I popped in. Will be coming here more than I should from now on. I got this sushiya roll and I was more than pleased! The salmon tasted fresh and the miso was on point. 10/10 recommend this spot.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,Great combination of Japanese and Korean food. The Sushiya roll and the curry kutsu are my favorite in the menu! Everything I've tried so far tastes fresh and flavorful. For sure my go-to Asian spot in IV
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I'm writing this review solely based on the fact that I am sitting here at 2 am on a Sunday night craving Sushiya (mind you, I graduated two years ago). I just love their IV roll & miso soup SO much! It's not your best quality sushi restaurant by any means, but it is damn good."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Surprisingly good, bit expensive though. California Roll was mediocre however the Spicy Tuna Roll, Crunch Roll, Shrimp and Hamachi were pretty good."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Love this place! Aside from all the sushi rolls, they have a great variety of Japanese dishes as well. The monkey ball is a must try!!! The sushi is really fresh. Honestly, a gem of IV:) they deliver through SBmenus as well so that's a plus"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Inspect your food before you put it in your mouth! Ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll last night and am now battling the worst case of food poisoning the world has ever known - think projectile vomiting- . The tuna was mushy and the color was too dark, like it had been sitting out at room temperature all day. This place needs to be inspected. Avoid this place."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Indeed I've had better. The only thing that keeps having me come back is their ""Heart Attack"" appetizer. Hooray for heart burn! **sarcasm**"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"If you are looking for high quality and affordable sushi. you can not beat Sushiya. The place recently changed owners and the new owners are doing an amazing job! it is a family run store and they are working hard to turn this place around. 

I have been there 3 times this week, every time I try something different and it is all very good. The company I work for is about to use them to do our catering. 

Hard working owners, fresh fish, well priced. If you live in IV or Goleta it is a no brainer. If you live in Santa Barbara it is worth the trip."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,I'm a  student and UCSB  and have noticed that this place was here when new owners took over last year. The menu has a lot of creative dishes that I still want to try. The 2 sushi plates that I have tried are Superb. The cashier is a student. She was nice and helpful. The place was very clean. The decorations and atmosphere were calming. Definitely returning soon.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"The one and only sushi place to get your sushi fix in IV. I've been here a handful of times when I've been too lazy to go to Sushi Ahi at the Marketplace. It's never crazy busy and you get your order within 15 min if there's no one else around which seems a bit much, but I have enough patience to wait.
I'm not THAT adventurous when it comes to sushi, but I have to say their california rolls are pretty good.The cost of the sushi itself is a bit pricey for the quality, and sometimes quantity, that you get. I mean I got 2 mini hand rolls for 4 dollars when I could have gotten 2 large hand rolls for 6 dollars at the Marketplace. 
Bottom line: a good place to go when you are attacked by that sushi craving."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,The beef Bento box was great! Beef was tender and delicious.  I was satisfied by the quality of everything else on the plate as well.  Definitely food for 2.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Not really as bad as people say.
I come here a lot because it somewhat satisfies my constant cravings for Japanese food without having to commute all the way to state street or goleta.

While the place does seem a little sketchy, the rolls are pretty solid. The hungry roll is huge (and not to mention deep fried). It's good, unique, and filling and comes with miso soup (so yummy) and salad!
The kiss dragon roll was pretty good as well.

I tried the sashimi dinner plate today and it was a little sketch. Only the salmon and tuna tasted legit while the other fish didn't taste as fresh. I don't think this is the best place to come for raw fish (or ramen for that matter; the ramen is basically ramen noodles placed in a generic udon broth). 

Order the chicken katsu plate or sesame chicken but keep in mind that the portions aren't exactly worth the price you pay in terms of the entrees and sashimi. 

However, if you are looking for a decent Japanese place, come here for the specialty rolls! Their lunch happy hour is a pretty good deal too, so check that out. The only thing is that some of the dishes are way too expensive for the quantity they give. Other than that, I'd come back for the rolls!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"The boyfriend and I ordered an Alaskan roll and a Kalbi combo for lunch last weekend. When they delivered it, we realized they delivered a Bulgogi combo instead of the Kalbi. I called Sushiya to tell them they got the wrong order, and James (the manager) told me they'd send the correct order right away. He called us a few minutes later saying he'd include a coupon for our next order.

The sushi was yummy and the portion for the Korean food was very generous. We saved most of the Bulgogi and a little bit of the Kalbi as leftovers for our next meal. They also include Miso soup with meal, and if you use the coupon code, you get a free ice cream mochi! It was a little bit pricey (lunch + delivery was about $30) but I think it's pretty worth it! I gave them the fourth star for really good customer service. Even though the delivery got messed up, we were impressed with how quickly they resolved everything and how well they handled the situation, and we would definitely come back here again!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Had to give it a 5 star review to level out all the one star reviews. If there wasn't so many one star reviews I woulda gave them a 4-star. The only sushi place in Isla Vista that I know of. They rolls are really good, they miso is super dank, and there staff is really friendly. Your order does take a lil time to make but they also deliver."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"This review is more for the experience than anything else. I was having a pretty bad day and was craving some inari sushi, something that I had really liked when I was younger but I wasn't sure if they had any. It was also my first time checking out sushiya, I had heard alot about how it wasn't good from a bunch of people, but seeing as it was the only sushi place around that might have inari sushi, I thought, why not?

 I walked in to where the lady was speaking with customers in what sounded like a mix of Japanese and Korean (I also noted that they offered a bunch of Korean dishes as well - to be tried next time), but I didn't want to interrupt so I just stood near the entrance and tried to see whether or not it was on the menu. She noticed me standing there after a little bit and immediately went to the cash register to help, so I asked if they had any of that sweetly savory goodness and she said ""of course!"". The price was a little more than what I expected, but... it was a bad day, so I decided on getting them for the price of 4.50 for 2 pieces.

As she charged me for them she asked me how my day was going, of course I answered ""good""; standard etiquette I presumed. Then after a short pause she asked me if school was going okay, I blustered a little saying ""yeah it was going fine"" with a slight nervous laugh. I could tell she noticed I was a little caught off guard, she gave me a sympathetic smile and nodded. 

After the exchange I went to sit at one of the high tables with stools to wait for my order, which after a 5 min wait, came. I left sushiya, thanking the lady. A few steps out I opened the to-go box, inside were the two inari sushi, some pickled ginger and a pearl of wasabi. But it was perhaps the best inari sushi I've had, they had added seaweed salad inside the fried marinated tofu skin wrapping the sushi rice, giving the sushi an entirely new texture sensation, accentuated umami and sweetness, as well as temperature contrast with the warmth of the rice. Add a few slices of the pickled ginger and there was a slight heat to the entire mouthful, enhancing the overall taste. 

But apart from how good the sushi was, I was most thankful for the lady's kindness and concern. It's not every day where someone you literally just met would go beyond social expectations and try to extend some care to a complete stranger. I know that inari sushi isn't exactly the most expensive sushi they have, as well as the fact that I didn't have any of their fish, but regardless, I'm hoping you all would give sushiya a second chance despite what your friends might be saying or the reviews here are saying. 

If not for stellar food (where can you even find that in IV?), Then how about for the experience and good service? For me, I know I'll be going back to try out the other items on the menu and to thank her for her kindness."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Japanese food....not at its best. ITs ""fast food"" that takes some time. Their food is somewhat greasy, such as the crazy roll, or somethign that deals with spice. For some reason the spicy sauce is oily and leaves a bad after taste.

But i do recommend their udon,. Its at a good price and it can't go wrong. Pair that with spicy tuna (doesn't use the sauce mentioned above)"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I come here for the lunch special: small salad, miso soup, soda, choice of 6 rolls (crunchy, California or one other option) and choice of rice bowl with like chicken, beef, tempura, etc. (they have 10 different bowl options in total I think). The lunch special is only $11 after tax and it's super reasonable (I usually split the meal with someone). The chicken katsu and the gyoza are my usually choices for the rice-meat bowl that they serve with the lunch special.

Quality here wavers, some days its better than others and I wish I could rate Sushiya 3.5 overall. But you get what you pay for; most rolls cost between $9 and $13. They also offer mochi as dessert (at a dollar each; which is ridiculous).

But yea, lunch special great! Everything else, meh."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"For it being what it is (a restaurant that caters towards college students, and a ""fast-food"" sushi joint), it's not bad. Their salmon is wonderful, they have Sushiya Combos that gives you the best bang for your buck (rice entree, miso soup, + 6piece roll for 12.95), and their current deal with all their Classic Rolls for $4.99 is great! Definitely satisfies my sushi cravings while being an IV resident!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"For $13 I ordered a chicken plate that came with one orange slice, the slightest bit of salad and chicken and no rice (even though it's meant to be included)"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,Used to come here cause it was cheap and relatively good... Not anymore. They raised their prices and the quality of food has gone down drastically.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,Tried to sit outside but the speakers are blown and blasting static. I spent $18 on a   spider roll and an eel avocado roll. The spider roll came with miso soup and salad. Lots of food but none of it that good.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,Best food in IV!!!! Quality food and always consistent. My favorite are the kalbi and baby baked lobster roll. So good!
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"The new owners are excellent cooks, making authentic homestyle Korean dishes, in addition to Japanese food. We ordered soft tofu stew and asked for no spice because my mom has acid reflux. They accomodated no problem. The food was fresh, portions were large, service was prompt and like previous reviewers have noted, the staff are super friendly. Also, bathroom was clean. The restaurant is simple but the spotlight is the tasty food and friendly service. Our family will definitely come back again."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I got the dragon roll for my order and thought it was ok but not great. Wasn't really expecting too much. There were somewhat a lot of bones in the eel. Overall decent, would go back again if I want quick sushi. But the miso soup that came with the roll was very bland! Really watered down"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"After a hiatus of about a year or two, I have revisited Sushiya.  Although the food was probably barely edible as usual, I didn't care because I was wasted.

C'mon people, this place isn't popular because of its food quality.  It's popular because it has an ideal location and the Bruce the Emperor and his collection of incompetent workers don't complain when you bring your own booze.  That's right, we show up with a 30 pack, a couple bottles of sake, and good people.  We always have an amazing time.

You can find me at the big table in the back left corner in groups of no less than 10 people."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"This restaurant has really really bad service, and cooking very slowly, also very expensive, if you are not fking rich, I recommend you better not come."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I've been here twice and I've found both experiences to be very pleasant. The food prices are roughly what you would expect in IV and the staff have been very friendly to me. The food itself was not amazing, but I wasn't too disappointed. I also enjoyed the fact that they hired college students.

Overall, I didn't share some of the negative sentiments of other reviews and I think it's worth a try to decide for yourself."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,So nasty. The food is like...the crappiest sushi could be. I came because I was enticed by how cheap it was but omg. I couldn't eat more than one piece because it was so gross. I'm surprised it didn't get me sick. Don't do it!!!! Go anywhere else. Repulsion is imminent.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"The food is decent, they have a wide variety so you can always find something that you want. The price isn't too bad I definitely get full off the special rolls. You can get sushi better somewhere else, it is IV and you should go downtown SB to get more quality sushi. The service is kind of slow sometimes and if you order over the fone, I would make sure you specify what you want.

They have japanese dumplings that are pretty good. I love the miso soup and you can't go wrong w/ that. They have a fried chicken or something I forget the name but it's gross! They have good edamame. The tiger roll and the tempura isn't bad either.

The location of the place is great though, smack in the middle. Parking can suck only because the lot is so small but there is plenty other places around. Just never park there if you do not plan on going to any of the places around. 

One guy was going to give me a ticket because I used their parking. Might I add the lot was completely empty! The guys' from dominos are on a power trip. I mean come on it's IV no one cares about anything...unlike these guys'."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"We used to go here weekly. Last time I ordered takeout, there was a loooong hair in my roll. It grossed me and I haven't been back since."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"It's not that great, but it's the only sushi place in IV. Generous portions of decent sushi plus miso and salad. The fish is not that fresh, but hey it's a quick fix for sushi cravings, walking distance, for those in IV. 

I'll come here because I'm too lazy to drive somewhere else when I live within 5 minutes of this place."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Recently under new ownership and the food and service are amazing! We had mixed tempura, a crunch red fox roll, yellowtail sashimi, kalbi, and tonkatsu ramen. I'm always on the search for a great ramen and this place has it! All of it was delicious and our kids even loved everything (they are tough critics!). The ladies working were very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Great food, great service...anytime we are in the area or driving through, we will definitely stop here!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"My old review was from the old ownership. The new owners have turned this place around and it is now very good. They use the best quality beef in their Beef Bento Box.

The new people serving are pleasant and professional. I usually deal with Leanne who is very helpful. And the music is no longer annoying!

I definitely recommend this place if you are anywhere around Goleta or UCSB!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Even though this is a Japanese restaurant, this place is pretty Greek.

OK folks, don't choke on your water laughing now.

I was visiting my little bro in IV when we decided to walk around. We settled on this joint and let me tell you, food quality definitely correlates with price. Our rolls (we got a combo plate for the three of us) were crumbling, they were so loosely packed. The fish, although edible, was not particularly fresh either. 

The green salad had a delicious ginger dressing, however. The tempura green tea ice cream had good ice cream and nasty tembura coating- it tasted like a flavorless, dry donut. 

I'm oscillating between 2 and 3 stars on this one. It wasn't very good, but I did finish it all, save the nasty tempura batter."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I have no complaints for Sushiya. We came in two days in a row! The sushi tastes fresh and they have a good selection of yummy Korean dishes, on top of the friendly service. I had the kimchi stew and it was great, it felt homey. I'm pretty particular with my Asian foods but Sushiya certainly has my approval. :)"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"It has been a long time since the last time I  visited Sushiya, but since they have a new owner and new menus I've decided to try this place out once more. My experience : not bad at all! The interior is pretty clean, and I like how the new menus on the wall show the pictures of each dish, looks very appetizing.

Tempura spicy tuna roll: The tempura batter is very crunchy and not overly oily. The spicy tuna itself is slightly bland but I guess you cannot expect too much tastes from regular tuna (it can definitely use a bit more spiciness, though). And it is very filling as I felt full before I finished it. It came with miso soup but no salad like in the past, but that's understandable because now the menus items are more reasonably priced.

Escolar sushi: this is the main reason I'm here because I have never tried this before and have never seen this on the menus of other sushi restaurants in SB area. Escolar is a very oily fish so it's also called oilfish. I realized how fitting this name is as soon as I took my first bite: it has a taste exactly like cream! Very unique. (If you are interested in trying this out, do not eat too much though, since the oil cannot be digested.)

Overall, I was satisfied with my meal and I wish to come back at some time to try their other dishes (i.e. soft tofu soup)."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Ming Dynasty (my go-to asian food) was closed so we decided to try Sushiya. We got tons of stuff: tempura, udon, miso, teriyaki chicken, gyoza, tofu stake and steamed rice.

The only decent thing was the rice. The miso tasted like the $2 packets I get from von's and it looked suspiciously similar. My udon smelled like rotten vegetables, honestly. It stank. The broth was simply inedible. I tried rinsing off the noodles under hot water and adding my own sauce but unfortunately the nast they had it in couldn't be expelled. The gyoza had the same musk that made the eating experience painful and sickening. The teriyaki chicken alternated between dry and stringy to mushy and gummy. Speaking of gummy, the ""deep-fried tofu stake"" (Is it steak? A stack? Unsure.)  was covered in a gooey layer that could be pulled off in one piece like chicken skin. That was underneath the deep fried sticky brown tar. I literally do not know how one can cook something like that. it was almost like a science experiment gone wrong. The tempura was questionable and overdone. It was actually kind of interesting to see my favorite vegetables that mushy and tasteless.

I feel bad, but everything I ate was worse. How do you mess up noodles that only have a broth and one vegetable? I am not picky at all but this was just plain terrible. PLEASE SUSHIYA PUT THOUGHT INTO YOUR FOOD."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"""One of the best in town""
If you looking for decent foods with great price, this place is the right one. Cozy and cool atmosphere as well. Very addictive place."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"muy buena comida!! No entiendo porque tan bajo está su calificación! Escuche que cambiaron de dueño hace poco. Les recomiendo que vayan a comprobar cómo cambió la calidad de la comida!! yo comi SPICY SEAFOON  RAMEN,  rolls, UDON y fueron increibles!! 
Mientras comía vi otros clientes que se pidieron combos, que parecian geniales también. Quiero volver para probarlos~"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"If you're craving sushi rolls and you live in Isla Vista, this is where you go. Not the best...the rolls are huge and always fall apart. You have to be in the mood to eat it. The noodles are good however. Just an average place...something you would find at a mall."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Sushiya is seriously the place I will go if no other Japanese restaurant is open (ie between the hours of 2:30 and 5:30 pm). Their handroll combination isn't bad but I really don't like anything else they serve here. This place feels like less of a restaurant and more of a fast-food sushi joint (pretty typical for college town food). There are better places for sushi, but this is the only choice in IV and the food isn't horrible - I just don't love it and there are other food options in IV."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Been coming here for a few years now.  Service was always ridiculously slow, from totally uncaring student employees, but the food was pretty good and for a great price and large portion.  Just came in after a couple month hiatus to find a (minimum) 20% price increase, but closer to 50% on nearly all ""classic rolls"".  
Great miso soup.  Love the crunch roll.  Fresh food.  Just don't come if you're in a rush to eat (sushi is made to order, which is nice)."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Had salmon skin salad and yellowtail roll for a quick dinner and it was not bad. Fresh salad came with a lot of crispy plaster salmon skins, and I was glad to find that the yellowtail roll had some thin green onions inside which was a traditional condiment to pair with yellowtail, even though the menu didn't mention this. Nice touch!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,This by far is the crappiest sushi place in Goleta period. The price is ridiculous for the quality and the servers are rude. Had to wait an hour for a pick up order because they were the only place open. They told me it wasnt their fault for waiting an HOUR to make my food. Had to get a refund. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,Their sushi was the best!!! especially their seafood ramen with bunch of high quality seafood!! Employees were very kind and always kept their smile. Their fish were in excellent condition. Will definitely come back for more!! must try!
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Quick easy to go on campus dab. 
A-OK service, A-OK quality, A-OK price.
But with sushi you dont wanna go wrong."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,Got their daily special of CA rolls. They were quick and the rolls tasted great. They deserve more than their current 3 stars
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"This place is gross. Their miso soup is insant powder and I found hair in my sushi. And the person working asked if I wanted them to remake me another one. Uhh hello? Why would I want that and have another hair in there? Don't think so.

I came here 3 times and never again. I tried giving it another chance and it's just too disgusting."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. In the case of Sushiya, it is definitely shame on me because I have given this place many more chances than it deserves. Finally, I can say lesson learned and I'm certain I'll never be desperate enough for a sushi fix that I'd settle for this ""sushi"" again.

This fast food sushi joint is overpriced and surprisingly NOT fast. The fish is not fresh at all (once I got some sort of chewy, rubbery, chunky concoction that seemed far from edible) and for the time spent making the rolls its ridiculous how sloppily they're put together. The california roll tastes like pure mayo and this is one of those places that puts paper thin slices of avocado in your roll that require a magnifying glass to be sure they actually put it in there.

If you like sushi, don't bother looking for it here. If you know someone who's never tried it, keep them away! This place is besmirching sushi's good name. Hate to say it, but this place is just plain gross."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,A great spot to college kids around UCSB with great choices! I highly recommend soontofu. You can tell everything is quality and for a great price! I'm definitely becoming a regular!! 10/10
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I haven't tried the sushi, but the teriyaki chicken entree was excellent - a perfect portion of meat, rice and salad. I would suggest a small miso soup as well to round out the meal. The only thing that sucked was that the day I was there, they were out of forks, so I gave myself a crash course in chopsticks :) I definitely want to return and try their noodles and perhaps, the sushi."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I used to eat here because it was the only sushi fix I could get , but then their price on my regular order went up 3 bucks and with it being mediocre sushi at eat, it was the last straw, I haven't ate there since, 2 years and counting , not real sushi but the price is what killed it for me, overall, take the trip and go dt if u have an itch for sushi"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I love their dessert options and sushi rolls. 

But waiting for the food to be served can sometimes be a big annoying."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I went right before school started because it is located by UCSB. I jad the Spicy Seafood Ramen and Eel&Avocado Roll. The Spicy Seafood Ramen was really rich, the soup was rrally thick and savory. It wasn't that spicy but it was perfect. The roll was really good as well. They put a lot of avocado and eel, I really like avocados and some other places only give a little. But they gave me a lot. The servers were really kind and friendly. I had a really nice time."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"So the sign that I should have walked away was that there were no lights on in the business and the lady was dozing off to the rear of the restaurant. The specials were hand written on a cardboard with markers like my did drew it.

Ordered the tonkostu ramen which was a big mistake. It took them about 10 minutes to prepare that and bring it out. It looked like they just opened up a bag of noodles that you get at the asain marker and heated it up. The pork was standard pork slices and super tough.
I also order their daily special roll.... california roll. It was decent. The sushi rice was cold. Not wrapped tightly at all.

And the funny part of it all was that when she rung me up. I had to pay for the ramen seperate from the california roll. I wanted to pay with CC but she stated that the daily special requirement was cash ONLY?????"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,The California roll is so good! Perfect size and not too much rice just the perfect amount of ingredients.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I got the teriyaki salmon plate for dinner. Comes w/ salad and white rice.

The food was alright, although the teriyaki sauce was somewhat salty.

Nothing too special. I have yet to try the sushi or ramen."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Would have been a 4 star rating EXCEPT the cashier ""forgot"" to give our order ticket to the chefs in the back. We waited 20+ minutes for our 2 order of sushi as we watched numerous customers get their orders even though the ordered after us. (however, we were comped 2 free fountain drinks but i only drink water so it didn't matter!)

With that said, the sushi was pretty good! We had the Dragon roll combination which was a HUGE roll with these weird fishy flakes on top (which i didn't like that much). There was plenty of avocado and eel in each bite. Warning: it's kinda hard to eat because of the size and may get a little messy.

Our other dish was the California and Spicy Tuna roll combination plate. You get a TON of sushi (8 pieces of each) and the presentation is pretty cool. 

Overall, a pretty good sushi experience for an 'express' restaurant."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I am VERY picky about seafood and even PICKIER about Korean-owned restaurants because I'm Korean and my family used to own restaurant(s) that had AMAZING food.

The fish isn't fresh, the portions aren't large, the prices aren't good. They rarely have the yakisoba and the white rice is always on the dry side. The California Roll is the second worst I've ever hard, the first worst being from CaliRoll (they should change their name immediately). And my non-Korean friends always say they feel super awkward and uncomfortable going in because the workers aren't very friendly and don't seem to speak English very well. 

I am Korean and haven't noticed that the not-speaking-English-very-well thing, but I do think the workers tend to be on the not-so-friendly side but I mean, student workers who are at work instead of with their friends can get cranky and nobody likes work, so bad service is understandable.

The menu is extensive, especially for an IV place BUT, I can't give this place above a three because their food is NOT worth it. And trust me I've been here a LOT, definitely at least twenty-five times. I got the spicy pork, rice, salad, sushi combination most often. The sushi is always kinda gross, but I always eat it anyway because IV food/Santa Barbara Asian food lowered my standards and cuz i'm a fatass. The sushi always comes with one yellowtail, one salmon and one tuna.  The salad is pretty good and the spicy pork is really good (the only saving grace for this place and the only reason why it squeezed out three stars from me). Anyway, this meal costs around 8-9 dollars... I would take my 9 dollars and get some Super Cucas or Naan Stop (best name ever)"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Best place to get Japanese sushi and Korean food in Isla Vista area. Highly recommend the Bimbimpa and tofu soup!
The staffs are very friendly!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"This place sucks. It's the best sushi in IV because it's the only place in IV to get sushi. That's by default not because it's actually good. 

The prices are the same as other sushi places which is relatively expense by IV standards and the sushi quality shits. If you're gonna charge me as much as a regular sushi joint at least give me something that comes close to the level of quality. 

Do yourself a favor and either drive to a sushi spot in goleta as the price is the same and its better, or buy from the sushi place inside albertsons as the quality is the same and it's cheaper.  Problem solved."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I was in IV and craving sushi and decided I would give this place another shot even though I've never liked it much. Mistake. 

The first issue was that after I ordered and paid, I was told that the chef was ""on an errand"" and would be back in 15 minutes. I don't know why I didn't ask for my money back right then. Hindsight.

I finally got my order and headed back to my office to eat it. I ordered the eel and avocado roll and the eel was dry, chewy, and inedible as if it had been sitting out for a week. Obviously I threw it out, along with the 8 or 9 dollars I paid for it. That's time and money I will never get back. I'm sure if I had eaten it I would have gotten a nasty case of food poisoning. 

Never again, Sushiya. Never again."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Food is somewhat inconsistent. Got the sushi-ya special sushi roll and it was delicious. Thought I'd try the chicken teriyaki bento box but I was pretty disappointed. The vegetable tempura was very very greasy, the chicken was too burnt (as someone who loves charred foods this chicken was too burnt) and had a somewhat odd taste. The side salad contained too much raw onion. Very expensive. Wouldn't recommend the bento box but service is good. Going to try the udon soon."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,Sushi is okay. It was already kind of expensive but then they jacked up prices to take advantage of the college kids because it's the only sushi place in IV. Bastards.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Came in right when it opened. The place is nice and open. However, the food wasn't that good. The fish didn't seem fresh and the miso soup tasted like water. The rolls were also a bit too drenched in sauce so it kept falling apart. The service was fine, but probably wouldn't come back if I was craving sushi."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I don't understand all the 1 star reviews, My parents and I visited last week and had some great food. I was surprised at how fresh tasting the fish was too, considering it is located so close to UCSB. 

A little weird as it was self-serve, but the girl at the register was super outgoing and friendly! 

Softshell crab: Crunchy coating like fish sticks, the crab was fresh and not fishy! comes with a salad which had a dressing that i really liked, wish they sold it in a bottle.

Sushiya Roll: Delicious! They put a mustardy type of sauce which was a refreshing touch, I thought it was unique.

Hawaii Roll: Spicy tuna on the inside and topped with fresh Ahi. The ponzu type of drizzle on it gives it a nice acidic touch.

Tonkotsu Ramen: Yo, I eat ramen at least 3 times a week back home in SF, and their broth is comparable to the better ramen places there. The chef told us they make the broth in house, which wins brownie points. No runny yolk or chashu here, but never the less simple deliciousness.

Spicy Seafood Ramen: Not too spicy, and packed full of flavor and seafood! Not overly fishy either.

They gave us Mochi Ice Cream on the house, and Im not the one to complain about free dessert! 

I hope they stay the same cause I'll be back!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I went in last Wednesday night to get something to eat. 
Im a bit of a regular there and for the most part I dont mind eating there. I think they are very pricey, but usually they make up for it in a bit of presentation or extra pizzaz on the quality.
But I went in and ordered some spicy tofu ramen noodles, and paid 8 bucks for what seemed like the biggest rip-off for a meal. 
I got Ramen that tasted, looked like and felt like cheap ass grocery store maruchan noodles. The ""spicy"" tasted like sriracha on ramen broth (from the packets) and 3 little stingy ass cubes of tofu. 

If this was my 1st and only time visiting Sushiya, I would give it 1 star. But since Ive had some decent meals before Ill give it 2 stars.

Overall, they should not try skimping on their quality. Trying to rip-off the costumer is no way to go for a sushi place. It will show and you will only loose business!

For now, I will stick to other items in their menu. It will be a while before I try their ""ramen"" again."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"If you are looking for a quality sushi place that uses fresh ingredients, this is the place. You'll know when you eat that they use good ingredients. I loved their sashimi plate and the yellow tail sashimi platter with their signature sauce. It was refreshing and tasty, of course. And I ended with their spicy seafood ramen, which was a bomb! I mean, too much word can't explain everything. Go and try, and you'll know. Highly recommended!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I'm so glad there's a sushi place in IV! I like their rolls a lot, but the only big downside is the pricing. The service is decent, the waiting time is decent, but it will blow a hole in your wallet. Now that the poke stores opened up, I think it's more willing and worth it to get one of those instead. If I'm in an urgent mood for rolls though, Sushiya will do."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,My food was taking a little and the workers there were super nice and apologized and came and brought me and my bf mochi for the wait. I LUV SUSHIYA U GUYS R TOO MUCH
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,This is my favorite sushi place in town. I've tried various foods off the menu from rolls and ramen to appetizers. I love their rolls and sashimi combo. Their Gaucho ramen and Spicy Seafood is the beeeeeeest.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,My personal favorite place to eat in iv. Foods really good and great service. I've ordered a bunch of different foods from here and they are always great. Would totally recommend.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"sushi is very low quality, and very expensive. They'll have something for $14 up on their wall and charge you $17 without a reasonable explanation. Definitely NOT worth the price. If you want sushi nearby id recommend pre packaged because it's better than what they serve there."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I want to give this place a better review because it is the only sushi in Isla Vista, but the quality just isn't there. When I walked in the two workers at the cash register didn't say anything at all until I ordered, I don't remember if the guy taking my order said anything at all (I ate here 2 months ago). The workers seem very unhappy. It was dead, however it took about 20 minutes for the sushi roll to be prepared. Where I sat down waiting, at the next table there was the top of a dirty to-go ketchup container on the floor. This was a little gross because nobody walked in after me until I was leaving, and the workers were just talking, not really cleaning at all. If I was a cockroach I would love to make a home in Sushiya Express.. ew. 

What disappointed me however was that the roll I ordered was just not worth the money at all, my nieces could make better sushi than this . It had mediocre taste, and difficult to eat because each sushi was the size of my palm, however loosely rolled. When I put the sushi in my mouth the ingredients inside came out! And someone was walking in the door and was staring at me as it happened! Talk about embarrassing! I left after that, and I still had half my sushi on my plate.

I want to like this place but the service, cleanliness, and food is just not there, especially for being so overpriced. There's better sushi elsewhere and cheaper."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"4 stars for being conveniently located in Isla Vista. when I need a sushi fix, I come here and order the crunch red fox. its the ONLY roll I ever order here now, its actually really big, it takes me 2 bites per piece. I've tried other rolls, ie the dragon roll, shrimp tempura, hand roll, all not that great. its definitely overpriced here, but what can you do about it? they're a monopoly and people will pay what they can to get what they crave!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I don't think its the best sushi I've ever had but the service is very friendly and the food isn't terrible. I had the dragon rolls with salad and soup. The salad was pretty bad but the sushi (which is more important) was really, really good. I also had a bite of spicy tuna which was nicely spicy unlike most of the time. Its also nice that they do delivery till about 11pm. Overall if your in the mood for sushi its a decent place to go in IV and is decently priced."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Decent food, though a bit pricey for what you get. I suppose that is the nature of sushi in areas where the fish isn't bought right off the dock.
     The crunchy roll and dragon roll are pretty tasty, though I always feel like crap after eating their spicy mayonnaise sauce. Still, the stuff is like crack and I keep going back for more.
     Overall, the place is okay if you don't get good sushi often enough to help you realize how truly crappy IV food is."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Probably best Asian place around 
Reviews anything lower than four stars are pretty extra I think. New ownership if there were bad experiences in the past...

RESTAURANT: indoors and outdoor patio with fenced in area for dogs ! Interior upgrade is good, noise level is good. Very clean and not too hectic

SERVICE: super kind owners and nice staff !!

PRICE: medium but totally worth quality 

FOOD: super hot and fresh :)

VARIETY: excellent!! Poke bowl, korean soup, katsu, sushi, udon, ramen, dumplings, u name it. One of the two places here you can get Korean food!!!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,One of the better places in isla Vista. The sushi is not the best but it's edible and it's better than the boxed sushi at grocery stores but it's nothing compared to REAL sushi/japanese restaurants. Service is alright..biggest complaint is the high price for the just ok quality of the food.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I can probably eat sushi everyday and never get sick of it, but I don't cus I'll probably get sick from mercury poisoning and it aint cheap, man. Here, the only thing cheap is the quality of the food. I mean, I get the concept of the fast-food sushi place, but at least be fair and match your prices to the quality. Sashimi is expectedly not fresh. Even the veggies in my salmon bowl were a mushy mess. Sadly, I come here anyway, cus I live in IV without a car, so it's either this or no sushi at all. That being said, come if you're desperate, like me."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Cheap, good sushi.

It's not the best, but it's awesome for the price."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I have mixed emotions about Sushiya. The food itself tastes fine. Nothing special, but definitely satisfies the sushi craving. You get a ton of food for your money also which is great. The only thing I'm iffy about is how fresh the fish actually is, and I notice that most of their rolls are spicy crab or spicy tuna instead of the fresh kind.
Regardless I still go to Sushiya and I recommend it unless you're a sushi-snob (I can be at times) and want great quality fresh sushi. For everyone else, I say Yaaa to Sushiya!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I've had the teriyaki chicken plate (which is chicken with rice and a salad) and the chicken yakisoba plate (which is... chicken with noodles and a salad). They were both eatable, and satisfied desperate teriyaki cravings; however I would never order ANY sort of raw seafood from any place in Isla Vista. JUST DON'T DO IT! You would gambling with your life my friend.

The gyoza were alright but tiny; the tempura veggie were not too bad either (but not for you if you don't care for squash/mushrooms/broccoli!).

The storefront is not good at all; there is no good place to queue for ordering and the music is constantly at a terrible volume. So if you have to have teriyaki chicken and just can't be bothered to leave IV, have it delivered to your home (which unfortunately means a minimum $20 order...)."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"The udon is absolutely the most horrible udon ive ever had . It was so sweet n rich obviousl made with some fast food style prepacked sauce.y We took it back to chef to remake it . They remade it but it tasted the same . 
Their excuse was it was a new packaged sauce they never tried before and it was the first time .  

It also took over 30 min for  the food to get done 
Waited so lang

The sushi wasnt fresh also 
I suggest this place up their quality or get out of the food business"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Ordered with my friends today and we all feel like shit right now. The food is made without any care by cooks that aren't even Japanese and couldn't care to match Japanese quality food. 

We all have stomach aches, whatever you do don't go here or order from here."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Really Good Sushi! Best sushi in IV!
The lobster roll is WAY better than the lobster roll at Edomasa.
Is a bit pricy for IV and also an fast food place.
No waiter, just a cashier that calls your number and you go up to the counter to pick up your order. 
The udon is decent, decent amount of noodles. 
They have some Asian drinks you can buy. 
There is also like 2 Korean dishes you can order."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"First, hire staff who actually want to be there and not say ""meh"" when I say thank you and goodbye.  Second, cooks who know what Japanese food is supposed to taste like might help too.  Getting a tempura roll with the spicy tuna fully cooked because it was in the grease too long is disgusting. 

Now, let's talk about cleanliness.  Cleaning helps keep vermin down and makes your guests feel like you care.  Having numbered wooden spoons that look like someone was digging in the dirt and have hand oil all over them is again, disgusting.  

Even students deserve having clean good food."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Don't go here, it's a waste of your money! Just because the restaurant is in a college town, they make any excuse to jack up the prices.  Anyway, their salads are good though (that's probably it).  Sushi rolls are okay, not much time seems to be taken to make them.  Sashimi is not good, tastes like the fish is old...

Their miso soup gets cold really fast...

My experience: I've been here a few times... But this time I got a california roll, and I wanted it dipped in tempura batter. So they charged me for that, and then 5 minutes later they tell me it's $5 extra. What the heck? Crazy... I'm not paying $5 extra for that. I asked for my money back, didn't buy anything and left.  If you're in the SB area, I suggest you just go to TAKENOYA on fairview, they (takenoya) actually have some really good dim sum too.

Anyway, back to Sushiya... Service is really bad. Doesn't even look like they sterilize or clean the place each night, just looks like they wipe it down with a wet rag.  Sorry, but I love sushi places...and this place is just not good."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I would like to start off saying that I am by no means a sushi snob, but I am a sushi lover, and I've tried quite a few places. Oddly, this little restaurant is one of my favorites.

I always get a special roll, which comes with a salad and miso soup. The soup is standard, nothing too exciting, and the salad varies but it usually mixed greens with onions, shredded purple-red stuff (honestly I have no idea what this is, doesn't have much of a flavor) and a yummy ginger-type dressing.

My favorite roll is the crunch red fox, and my boyfriend and I usually get that and then  mix in another special. I love spicy food so I usually try anything with spicy tuna in it. The Tsunami and Poisiden rolls are pretty tasty. The only real downside is the amount of spicy mayo they use. I'm not a big fan of mayo in general, and I can't say I hate the flavor of the spicy mayo but I still grosses me out a little, and doesn't seem necessary. Try the rolls without it.

(Also the phone number listed is incorrect, their actual number is 805 961 8272)"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"im torn. 

went once and the fish was appallingly old. got dragged back by the kid and actually had some fairly fresh sushi. so i give it 3 stars. not a lot of choices around there, so sometimes you have to roll the dice and take your chances. i guess the one thing i can say for sure: it was definitely pricey for the quality."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I used to love Sushiya because of its convenient location. The portions are filling and pretty tasty for a sushi joint in IV.

But unfortunately, I've found hair in my food... on two separate occasions. First I found one floating in my miso soup, and then the cashier just replaced it with a new one, and the second time I found a small strand tangled within the center of my roll. Definitely unsanitary, check your food before you eat it."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"It's an alright sushi place if you haven't had good sushi.

It's really overpriced, too, IMO. But, it's close to UCSB--I'm assuming that's the only reason this place survives."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Love this place. When i was in freshmen year three years ago I guess there were different owners. When I started coming here laat year, i found my hidden gem in IV. Whenever I crave sushi or authentic Korean food, I go here. Usually the beef/clam tofu stew (ORDER EXTRA SPICY****) and I really like the Sushiya roll. Owner and his daughters are super nice and always greet me with a smile. Im sad to leave this place after grad in June. Its been a comfort food place!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,I found a piece of plastic in my salad. However this place is basically a fast food restaurant.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Its nothing crazy special, but simply a good time. For sushi it has a great variety and is just what you need when you want to go out and not spend a ridiculous amount of money. I have come here several times and Im always satisfied with the service!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Spicy seafood ramen was great. The fish on sushi and rolls is well-portioned and as fresh as I would expect at this price point. Service times and food seem a lot better after the ownership change, and the new Korean menu items are very tasty and authentic. I really liked the kalbi and soft tofu soup."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Ill be honest. this place is terrible when compared to other sushi establishments. Their rolls are overpriced but tasty. If you live in IV this is really your only bet to get sushi if you dont have a car. If you do I suggest either Ahi sushi or somethings fishy. The only deal I really believe in there is there lunch special from 11am to 3pm during weekdays. Bowl, rice, miso, roll and salad for $10. Good deal indeed."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"The sushi is pretty good, not as good as something downtown but for being right here in IV it's nice. A little pricey for how much food is given, a plate combo usually doesn't fill me up. I almost always go with the monster roll which is just the right amount of spicy for me, do recommend. Overall if you're craving sushi and don't want to drive downtown to wait in lines, this is a nice quick spot to solve those cravings, or you can get it delivered straight to your door."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,If you think the food here is bad then you have no idea what Asian cuisine is supposed to taste like. This new owner makes the best Korean and Japanese food I've had in this area hands down. The staff are very sweet and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. I don't have one complaint about my visits here
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I wish that i could give this business negative stars!

Here is the definition of Sushi: n.
Cold cooked rice dressed with vinegar that is shaped into bite-sized pieces and topped with raw or cooked fish, or formed into a roll with fish, egg, or vegetables and wrapped in seaweed.

Note the BITE SIZED PIECES part?? Sushiya obviously does not understand this concept! i got a roll that sounded so mouth watering and when i got it, each piece was the size of a chocolate chip cookie. and it was the sloppiest thing i have ever seen. it took at least three bites to eat each piece. needless to say i ate one piece and was done with my $8.00 roll. it was falling apart, the avocado had brown pieces on it, the crab was coming out of both ends. It was the worst display of sushi i had ever seen.

Also, i was the only customer in the store the whole time so it was not like they were in a rush to make my roll. they had all the time in the world to make some great food.

Please do not go here and lets run this business into the ground!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,really good miso. there bulgoki and kalbi plates are awesome never had such a good marinated plate before specially in IV people should try it also there  soups are really good and there oriental chicken salad is BOMB
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"The food is OK. Not the best, but OK. But the staff people are not a happy bunch. And it shows in the service, or lack thereof.

Not just that it is slow (it is). But they show no interest in you. Even if no one else is around and the order is taking forever, they never check to see what is happening or give any assurance that anything is happening at all.

One more thing: I find the music so annoying that this alone is enough to make me dread staying for long. They use ""Spotify"" set to the tastes perhaps of a fifteen year old.

If they could improve the morale and the music I actually might enjoy coming in, even if it is not the very best Japanese food.

If they can't do it, maybe someone else would like to open a better Japanese place in Isla Vista!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I had a coupon that I gave to the cashier at the time of check out with an expiration date of 3-27-17. I paid for my purchase, and while I was waiting outside for my order the cashier told me that he was going to cancel the order because he called his manager and the coupon was not valid. You accepted the coupon and payment. Then 10 minutes later track me down to try to redo the order? You need to inform your staff on what is no longer accepted. You also need to stop emailing coupons to your customers and not accepting them the day it was received. Don't get me wrong the food is great but just really didn't appreciate the situation."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"You probably didn't come into this restaurant looking for a trove of information on just how radioactive their food supply is, but if you did, have a look around, if not, then leave immediately.  

You should know right away that you have a problem when the sushi bar you walk into has chefs that look like their straight off the set of breaking bad. I have only eaten here a few times, but it has never been worth my whale. Yes, I know my puns may have you rolling on the floor, but I must maki-it known that people should not eat at this horrible establishment. 

These rolls are so Americanized that I might as well be eating fried mayonnaise balls with a side of shame. Not a single thing on their menu is actually healthy, as sushi is typically meant to be. The sheer amount of cream cheese they use in their roles could supply a New York bagel store for months, perhaps years. I am also truly concerned that almost every role has tempura-something in it. Perhaps all of these roles are simply a ploy to distract from the incompetence and lack of finesse that their chefs embody; perhaps they are trying to display the facade of a healthy image, or perhaps they have absorbed too much seaborne radiation from the Fukushima disaster last year. 

Either way, if you waste your money in this place, be it on their sticky fried rice balls where something hide in crunchy, or their slippery eel mayonnaise volcano eruption roll, you will be soy sorry."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Horrrrrible service... What else can I say that's positive about Sushiya. Oh, it took 30 minutes to get my sushi when the restaurant wasn't crowded and it was just average​."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,Good quality food and very friendly service. Also a very short wait to get food which is great for college students. 10/10 would go back
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Sushiya reopened today, and everything is such better quality! The food is so good, and the new menu offers way more options, like bento boxes, poke bowls, salads, etc. Even though they had a really crazy opening today with a wait time of 2 hours, they handled it so well. I came back to pick up my food and had to wait just a little bit longer, so one of the workers picked out her favorite drink from the fridge and gave it to me for free. It was so kind! And even after such a long and busy day, she was still smiling! I highly recommend the new place."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"New favorite place to eat sushi. I always get spicy salmon , it's under number 8. Staff is pretty friendly. I always like to come back."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Yuck, the food is really big, and low quality. It takes quite a while to get your food and it is plasticy/rubbery. Usually I do not rate this low but this place struck me as a gross place to eat."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Scrumptious food, generous portions, pocket friendly prices, and friendly service. What more can you ask for?!? Quality of the sashimi was amazing and look at that thickness! Awesome location where you can taste genuine Korean & Japanese cuisine  Thank you Chef James for all the yummy food!!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"After driving 4 hours from Fresno, Ca, I had to wait 25 more minutes for my food after ordering. I came in a group of 5 and one person out of our group got their food so our whole table sat and watched as he ate his food. I turned around and looked at the cash register and both girls working were on their phones. People that ordered after us were getting their food before us. I left a tip as I paid at the counter too. The workers never checked up on us during our wait. Never come here. It was a joke."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Unfortunately, the prices for the food itself is on the expensive side, even for IV; though I've heard their Kalbi (which isn't Japanese food...) is better, their Salmon Teriyaki is overcooked and the salad is less than desirable. Unless you're dying for Japanese food, in which case I would recommend putting in 30 minutes more effort, I wouldn't recommend coming here for your wallet and palette's sake...

The redeeming factor about the restaurant here is that their service is great and the servers are really friendly!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"The shrimp killer roll is my favorite here. Basically, it's a shrimp tempura roll with sushi shrimp, tempura crumbs, avocado, and yummy sauce on the outside. Definitely recommend to anyone who likes shrimp like I do. Also, it's big enough to fill me up by itself."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"3 1/2 stars for this place.

PROS: they really stepped it up after they changed ownership in terms of menu variety, cleanliness and decorations, customer service, and overall look and atmosphere. They added a bunch of korean food ideas to the menu, which all sound really good. I decided to get the beef tofu soup with rice, which was pretty good! I would say it's one of the only more authentic ones in Santa Barbara area. The customer service was really good. I talked to the cashier who was the daughter of what seemed like the owner. She told me, ""the korean food here is really good because my mom cooks all of it herself"". That gave a little plus points for this review because it's family owned and they were all very friendly. I would definitely come back for more Korean food. :)

CONS: I ordered a rainbow roll another time because the place is called ""Sushiya"" so it should be known for sushi. However, I do not like the roll at all. The fish wasn't very fresh and had a weird texture. I didn't think anything of it, so I ate it anyway, BUT later in the day I started feeling really sick and nauseous. I didn't really eat anything else after that roll so I'm thinking it was the sushi. My friend ordered the salmon tempura roll and he said it was pretty good. However, he started feeling sick after too.

OVERALL, I would say the korean food here is pretty good! I will come back to try more. As for the sushi, I wouldn't really recommend it. They should change the name and call it a Korean restaurant, maybe it would attract more customers because they will think it's something new! Pretty positive experience overall, but the sushi really turned me off :("
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Surprisingly good for Isla Vista food. Fair prices and consistently fresh, delicious sushi. I like that the specialty rolls come with miso soup."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Sushiya Express never ceases to blow my mind..... but not in a good way. Being from the Bay Area I have been around wonderful Asian food my whole life, so obviously I get cravings..... While I know the food in Isla Vista isn't great overall Sushiya is by far the WORST sushi I have ever had, hands down. 

For the price, which isn't all that cheap ($10-11 for a 6 piece roll) the quality is awful. To be fair, the teriyaki chicken is so-so, but everything else... save your money. 

Today was it. Every time I've come here they always mess up my order. I don't know what it is about them, but they can never get it right! I ordered the Dragon Roll over the phone and asked the guy who was working what EXACTLY comes in it. He told me eel and avocado on top with a california roll and shrimp tempura on the inside. I've made it a habit to always look inside the box to see what they give me because they always mess up and today was just the last straw. I asked the man what the curly white stuff was on top of my roll that smelled pungent and gross. He looked at me for a minute and then went to the back and came back proclaiming, ""smoked dried fish""..... If I wanted that on top of my roll I would have asked for it, and why didn't he tell me this when I asked? The smell honestly made me want to gag and when I told him that I didn't ask for that he looked at me like he could have given a flying, you know what. Not only is the food awful, but the service is the worst! Someone should buy this restaurant and make it decent or put a new japanese restaurant in IV so that they have some competition! 

Avoid if you can resist your japanese cravings. I promise you they wont be met anyways."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,I honestly don't understand the poor ratings below. This is the BEST sushi place in town PERIOD (the picture says everything)
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,I went in today based on the menu that was posted but there's new owners and everything is way more expensive now. $10 for miso? No thanks.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"To be honest, I wasn't stoked on this place when some coworkers and I ordered from SB Menus for lunch one day. When they reopened after a change in management, I still hadn't heard great things, but now I'll be back. 

We got one of the large combos and it came with several rolls, various types of nigiri, some seaweed salad, and miso soup. We also got some monkey balls on the side and those turned out to be a hit! The sushi was also surprisingly good for a shop based in IV. They put generous slices of fish on the nigiri and while the rolls weren't amazing, they were solid. 

My only complaint would be that the monkey balls had a little too much sauce on them and fell apart easily, but not a big deal. I'm excited to try out the Korean dishes on their menu!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,WAYYYY too expensive for the mediocre sushi they serve.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"First of all, I just called them three times and they didn't answer.
Second, their food is inconsistent, sometimes good sometimes inedible. They also give very little ginger.
Third, their service is lazy and unprofessional.

If you want sushi in Isla Vista, your best bet is to go to Camino Real Center and eat at Itsuki."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,Came to the IV to visit and my boyfriend told me about this sushi place. We come in and it's super cozy. The people were super sweet. The sushi is great. Recommend the baked salmon roll and the popcorn scallop. Will be coming again when I visit for sure.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"The mixed tempura was way too overpriced for the amount given and the vegetables were a little undercooked. 

The rainbow roll was okay at first but the fish on top after the shrimp did not look fresh or appetizing. I removed it and ate the bottom part.

Overall I wouldn't spend money here because it was nearly $30 for the quality here."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,All around bad. Over priced for not great sushi and the service is awful. The person working yelled at me when I asked for a trash can to throw away my trash. Incredibly rude and I will not be wasting my money here ever again.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"EEEE SUSHIYA IS SLOW, FOOD IS MEH, EXPENSIVE, and just BADDDDD. Everytime I come here my food takes forever to come out. Also it's like way too expensive for even sushi, like really? I get the katsu combo usually and that sitll costs be like 14 bucks like DAYUM. I just feel like anyone who works there hates life cause they definitely do not look enthusiastic. I say only eat here if youre desperate for japanese food but other than that you would probably have a happier meal if you fished for some fish yourself and made sushi. We do live near the ocean~."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Not the best sushi, but when you're craving it, and you're in Isla Vista, watcha gonna do?

I've tried a few different rolls here. Nothing particularly stands out. Just try to avoid stuff that uses mock crab. (around half the menu)

Try to go for rolls that have tempura shrimp, eel, or spicy tuna as the filling and then pick whatever stuff you like on top of the roll.

The rolls here are huge. You will not be able to fit one into your mouth (that's what she said). You have to bite it in half and eat it that way.

Expensive ($12+). Comes with miso soup and salad.

I would go here when I didn't want to make dinner and had a particular hankering for sushi.

One time I had to wait over 30 minutes for my order to come up and it turned out that they had just left the order around somewhere and forgotten to give it to me even though I asked the girl at the front two times about it. They do hire students though, so what can you expect?"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"The food quality is better than ANYTHING you'll find in IV. I got the miso ramen and my friend got the gaucho ramen. Both tasted really good! I usually get the Korean food here when I'm craving something from back home, and everything's authentic. Their tofu soup is my fav!
Service is great too!
Sushiya has a bad rep cause of the old owners but it's been under new ownership for a while now
I've read a couple of bad reviews and it just sounds like ppl are too cheap to pay for good food...
Go try this place out!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,super yummy and eli is the best cook there. the kimchi stew is fire. one of the few korean places in the santa barbara area (:
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I've been a regular here for quite some time now and I still continue to come here a lot. It's one of the best restaurants in IV in my opinion. I like the nice variety of everything, they offer rolls and a small variety of Korean food too. My favorite rolls here which I think are the best includes the red dragon roll, Alaska, and baked salmon roll. I did not like the Sushiya roll or cash 10 that I've tried because they have crispies on them to hide the fact that the fish is really thin on those particular rolls from what I've observed. One really good thing is that all their rolls come with miso soup! I've also had their Chirashi bowl once, and it's pretty good too. 
Their ramen is also pretty solid! I really like the seafood ramen and the miso ramen. I especially think the miso ramen is well worth it, and it remains one of my favorite items for the value.
Out of the Korean variety I've had, I've tried the kimchi fried rice, the kalbi, and the tofu clam soup. The kimchi fried rice was not bad, but to me lacks anything extraordinary. The Kalbi I've tried was really good! Although to me, it's an expensive dish, it's well worth the try. I wouldn't get it as often though. The tofu clam soup which I've had many times is lovely. It has a nice flavor to it, includes rice and an egg inside and is one of my favorite items. 
In conclusion, this place is one of the best in IV. Don't be fooled by ""express"" because their food is not fast food quality, everything is gourmet and tastes great! I'm sure anyone can find something they'd like from here. My favorites are: miso ramen, red dragon roll, Alaska roll, baked salmon roll, the kalbi, and the tofu clam soup. Anything you order you can't go wrong!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"delicious and fresh sushi! we also loved the katsu curry, and the beef soft tofu soup! I have been looking for a place with soft tofu and this place did a great job!!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I ordered the Korean chicken samgyetang soup and salmon nigiri and I just remember being shocked at a Korean restaurant (or at least they have Korean dishes on their menu) and the lack of extras. Obviously it's located in IV and I don't expect any side dishes, but I felt like my chicken soup was so bland. Definitely a shock to me because I ate this growing up and had other flavors to eat with. The salmon sushi was also pretty pricey for the amount I got, but again it's IV so... Maybe I will try again if I'm craving Asian food."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Being the sushi hoe that I am, Sushiya satisfied my weekly sushi craving when I lived in IV back in college. Sure, it's not the cheapest nor best sushi place I've had, but it's conveniently located in IV and has a massive sushi roll selection. Our only other sushi option near campus are those boxed up cold ass refrigerated California rolls separated by that fake ass grass--you know what I'm talking about...the paper grass that is entirely pointless, since it does nothing for aesthetics--from the Arbor. So major points for Sushiya for offering a good selection of Japanese cuisine for the starving college community."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I used to hate this place, but ever since the new owners came in I come here all the time! I was skeptical to try their new Korean items, but I gave in bc my cravings got too strong. Their kimchi stew is actually GREAT (coming from someone who knows what good kimchi chiggae tastes like), and I catch myself coming back every few weeks.

Only downside is the price. I'd come much more often if just one meal here didn't make such a huge dent in my wallet. Tbh it's pretty overpriced. For $13, I only got half a container of kimchi stew and rice (see picture). In LA or OC, I could get much much more stew WITH side dishes for only $9. Another price comparison - $13 can get you a gigantic plate of nachos at Freebirds that you can split between two or three people. Hope they reconsider the pricing... otherwise, food/service is good & I recommend!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Don't order to go. I got the curry and asked for no carrots. They ended up only putting one piece of beef in there. Like, at least give 4 more (the beef is small cube pieces). So ridiculous like I don't want to eat just rice and potatoes with some curry. Trying to carb me up I guess."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I just enjoyed some seriously good sashimi and a spicy tuna roll. The fish had a delicate flavor and wonderful texture, was fresh, and not at all fishy tasting. The spicy tuna roll was pleasantly spicy and had a really good amount of tuna in it. Even the side of miso soup was super delicious! Definitely coming back."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,I have to say this is awesome even though it's not like the rolls I had in Asia. Never expected the fillings to be so creamy. I'll definitely order it again.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"For a little sushi spot in a college town, Sushiya Express definitely goes above and beyond. I've been coming here since my freshman year and always order my absolute favorite--the Alaska Roll. I'm impressed every time at how fresh the salmon, avocado, and crab taste. As an LA native who grew up eating good quality sushi, I can tell you that the sushi at this establishment is good quality, and more than this, is very reasonably priced. Additionally, the wait time is usually no longer than twenty minutes, and service is always great. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for some good sushi in IV."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"DO NOT ORDER BIBIMBAP ! ! !
SUCKS! ! !
It's the most ever bad bibimbap I had
I will never order it again and tell others don't order as well"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Best Shrimp Tempura in Goleta

I love this place. I eat here as often as I can afford. I cannot get enough of the Sushi Ya roll -- why isn't this offered everywhere?? I'm also a *huge* fan of salmon nigiri and sashimi, so the freshness of the fish here really matters a lot to me because I don't use soy sauce or anything to mask the delicate flavors of the fish. They do a great job following custom orders (no this, extra that...) and are as pleasant as can be. My favorite restaurant in IV by far, and some of the best, affordable sushi to be found in the city. It may be located in Isla Vista, but the sushi is Downtown Santa Barbara quality!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"My friends and I ordered the budaejjigae, rainbow roll, baked salmon roll, and donkatsu. The food was all pretty good. I personally ordered the sushi and the baled salmon roll was really heavy on the sauce. It was yummy though. The rainbow roll came garnered with red onion shavings and made the rolls taste fresh. Each roll came with a miso soup too. 2 rolls were ~$30. The budaejjigae tasted like kimchi jjigae (kind of sour if you're unfamiliar with kimchi) but decent. The meats in it balance it out. Only downside was the price for the size. Definitely can fill one person but a bowl was ~$23. The katsu came with a side of rice, greens and the sauce. All these satisfied my craving for Asian food!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Love sushiya udon, kiss dragon roll, and sushiya roll. Actually all food I've tried there was really delicious!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I had heard this place was under new management so I wanted to check it out. At first glance of the menu I thought it was a little pricey until I received my order and realized how large the portions were.

I ordered the kimchi fried rice as well as the snowcone roll. For some reason I thought the kimchi fried rice was a la carte and wondered why it was so expensive. 

As for the snowcone roll, I also expected just a normal small roll. Both items are quite large and came with an order of miso soup.

Needless to say I had plenty of leftovers to take home for dinner and enjoyed multiple meals out of these two entrées!

I would love to come back and try to seafood Ramen! That really caught my eye as well as a few other entrées."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,They take about 20 mins to prepare two rolls. I have waited several long times for simple rolls. Not even something that needs to get fried. Sad this is the only sushi spot in IV.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Love this place, obviously not the best sushi you'll ever have but for the price and location, I think they really deliver. Cashiers are always nice, and food is good."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Just don't. Miso is okay but how can you go wrong there?? Sashimi is stomachable, the rest is comparable to your local Seven Eleven."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I really enjoy the sushi here.  The quality of the fish is surprisingly good for Isla Vista.  Yes, it is expensive, but actually I find that it is very reasonably priced compared to many sushi places that I have gone to in the past.  I prefer to keep it simple with the rainbow roll or Hawaiian roll.  I have also tried the 'army stew,' which I must say was absolutely delicious.  Each roll comes with free miso soup which is lovely.  I did choke on a fish bone during my last outing, but I suppose that is my fault  and not theirs."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"While it is not completely inedible, my spicy tuna tempura roll was made with either canned tuna or far over cooked dry tuna and my BSCR roll was soggy and the scallops itself were fishy. Not an ideal meal for $35. My fault for thinking sushi in IV would be a good idea for dinner."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,It's not the best( as we can expect from IV food) and pretty expensive. But it can satisfy sushi cravings when you don't want to go downtown! The wait time is insane on weekends tho.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Surprised to find this restaurant in Isla Vista, an area of mostly college students.

I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon while  visiting my daughter at UCSB. She and her bf wanted sushi for lunch but we were short on time and a trip to Santa Barbara would not have worked.  At their suggestion, we ate here.  I wasn't expecting much since it was located right next to the school and the word ""Express"" is in the name.  

Fortunately, our experience exceeded my expectations.  They've dined there before so they knew what to expect thus the recommendation.  Here's what I experienced.

*A small to medium sized ""order at the counter"" sushi restaurant with Japanese decor. 
*Indoor and outdoor (communal) seating.
*A small parking lot with easy parking since most walk or bike there.
*Street and city lot parking readily available.
*Good amount of options on the menu.
*Pricing comparable to more traditional sushi establishments.
*Friendly service at the counter and table. They bring the food to the table. 
*Tasty food and decent portions.
*Fast service.
*Functional restroom with key.

We ordered 2 veggie rolls, a rainbow roll, a dragon roll, a spider roll, edamame and unagi sushi. Our meal came with miso soup.  The rainbow and dragon rolls looked very similar to each other and appeared to resemble the shrimp tempura rolls over what we ordered.   But they were good so we had no complaints.  Our taste buds were happy and our bellies were full. 

I loved the convenience.  I will definitely be back!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"This place has some really good sushi! Not gonna lie, dis not expect it to be soooo tasty. Thank you Borah and Sushiya for good food and service! Will be coming again!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,It was my first time ordering at Sushiya Express since it was the closest sushi place in Isla Vista. I would say that it satisfied my Japanese food craving! I ordered the kimchi beef rice and the Crunch Red Fox Roll! I definitely liked it! A must try if you haven't tried it yet! Prices seem to be just right. Location is close to all the other food chains. Food is pretty good!
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"This one worker with glasses is such a hard working lil boy, he made me feel welcomed at this restaurant. The food was delicious and the price was not even that bad. Would come again 10/10"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Pretty good sushi imo. But the prices are very high. I know sushi is almost always pricey, but this was pricey pricey. Decent customer service, relatively long wait times. As good as can be expected for a sushi place in IV."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"The fish they use for their sushi is not fresh, and it's given me a stomachache the past couple times I've eaten here.

I got a roll (not sure of the name) with salmon that was meant to be baked. The salmon came back seared on the top, but it was cut unevenly in chunks (and not in thin slices, as I'm used to), so parts of the salmon were undercooked and parts were seared. Not the most pleasant consistency or taste.

My go to order here used to be the tempura udon, but I think they got a new chef, because the soup base for their udon is extremely salty and barely drinkable and the noodles are always overcooked. In addition, the tempura has become extremely greasy and is frequently not cooked through in the middle and you can taste the uncooked flour, which is extremely offputting

For the price, quality of the food, and size of the portions, Sushiya Express isn't worth it (in my opinion)"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,I've eaten here a few times and its been decent but i don't usually order fish. Thought i would try out the rainbow roll and let me tell you it did not taste as good coming up as it did going down
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Years later and I still love this place. I am a rabid sushi fan who eats sushi at least once a week if I can afford it. (Why don't other restaurants offer this amazing Sushiya roll?) I went there so often the entire staff knew me by name. They are so friendly and always ask me about school. Even after graduating, I would still go back. It's a pain to drive in Isla Vista but it is WORTH it for this restaurant. Don't be fooled by the quality of the surrounding Isla Vista restaurants: this place is delicious, high quality, fresh, and fast. I have never been disappointed. It is a truly wonderful family-owned and operated small business with nice indoor & outdoor seating, mere steps from the beach. Don't sleep on this place. It may be in a student area but it is higher quality & more affordable than Sushi Teri etc. I've eaten here more times than I care to count, & will return whenever I'm in the area."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,Rude. Just absolutely rude.  It's sad to see hospitality take a back seat. Walked out without even ordering.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"I never would have thought to come to IV to eat Japanese and Korean food, but the pictures on yelp looked nice and I decided to give it a try, and it turned out to be a nice surprise.  The rainbow roll was medium sized, not as generous as Goleta Sushi House, but still decent size made with fresh fish and came with a bowl of miso soup.  The shoyu ramen came out fresh and hot.  It was not Nikka, but the attention to detail earned some points for me.  The tender pork belly was finished on the grill and the egg was cooked to the right consistency.  Lastly, clam soondofu was good enough to curb my craving for Korean stews.  It came with half a dozen clams, an egg, and lots of custardy tofu.  It could use a little more seasoning and I wish they offer some kimchi with the Korean dishes.  Sushiya will be a good alternative to Choi's since the later closes early."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I've never had a problem with Sushiya before and have always liked their sushi, but they've jacked up their prices so much. At this point, your spending nobu prices on mediocre sushi. No thank you"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Sushiya was once a formidable foe for healthy gut bacteria. Ever since its ownership takeover in 2016, it has since become a formidable foe for my wallet. There were certainly lumps and bumps along the way, from my co-workers' experiences with the place, but it seems to have truly improved in quality.

I ordered a dragon roll and California roll, while Emily L. purchased a snow cone roll and tempura California roll. Paying $20 (including tax) for just two rolls left me with a bit of sticker shock, even if it made for a nice dinner and midnight snack. No bowl of miso soup would ever make me reconsider that thought! I think the quality for our food, however, was solid. The eel was broiled wonderfully. While the roll was drenched in too much unagi sauce, I think it was a solid choice given the crunchy shrimp tempura and crab meat. Crab salad was mixed with quite a bit of mayo. Both rolls were incredibly filling.

I tried some of Emily L.'s snow cone roll, only to find out shortly after that we got the wrong roll (hence the star subtracted). We ended up with something with baked salmon and broiled cheese, with a hint of spicy crab salad. Nonetheless, it was tasty. 

New to the menu is a wealth of Korean dishes, including promising spicy seafood ramen and tofu stew. These dishes all fall within the $10-20 range, topping out at a platter of bulgogi for $17.99. It's way more expensive to order on SB Menus, so you should suck it up and place an order in-person."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"We love this place and it has become our go to sushi restaurant. The food is amazing. It is always fresh, the rolls are large and generous. Everything is always delicious and every role has its unique taste. No matter how busy they are, their food is consistently great and the presentation is lovely. We discovered this little gem at the beginning of COVID and have been getting our sushi there ever since. And it is reasonably priced. Don't let the ""express"" name fool you because everything is made fresh and it shows. Even their miso is delicious and included. We call in our orders and then go pick them up but you also have the option of sitting outside on their picnic tables.  I highly recommend this little restaurant!"
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,We loved it here! This restaurant gives you lots of bang for your buck. My friend and I got the Alaska roll and the Rainbow roll. They were filling and delicious! We will definitely be back.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"I like the combos here, I think they are a good value. Sushiya is fairly average in every way but the combos are decent. The spicy chicken wasn't spicy enough but I did enjoy it. 

It's always dead here and it's a good place to go if you're just chilling in IV.

Hair in the sushi roll, come on that's a fail. I didn't let that instance detract otherwise the rating would be lower. Just want people to know that they should check their roll."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,They use PLAIN RICE to make sushi instead of seasoned sushi rice (with sweet vinegar). I was confused because I've never had a roll made with plain rice before. Is this their style? I really don't think I would ever go back here.  It was so bland I just couldn't believe it..... so disappointing.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Definitely still not good sushi, at least for the price they charge.

Sushi tastes very mediocre, nothing really that would make it stand out or make you excited about the food. 

Had the chicken katsu a couple times, watch out it really does look disgusting, very spongy and definitely a cheap meat.

They will NOT work with you on substitutes, even though you would ask for substituting a meat for tofu (cheap?!), they would still charge you $2 a piece. A little stingy when you charge so much for the bowls.

Service is alright."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,This sushi is good given the options in IV. I had a rainbow roll and it was good. They have outside seating during the pandemic. I would say the waiting time is a bit long (around 20 min). If you are craving sushi and you are in IV this is a good option.
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,positive,"Delicious sushi!  It is a bit on the pricey side, but they do give you a lot of food (the rolls are huge) and it's great.  I always get the Rainbow Roll."
DzpaiMQnB_sNhZPrgdvKHg,Sushiya Express,Japanese,negative,"Ordered a spider roll today and the staff was really nice and the wait wasnt too long so I'll give them 2 stars, however the portion sizes are ATROCIOUS. how are you going to charge customers $14 for a roll with only 5 (edible) pieces?? the end pieces were so large they fell apart when I tried to pick them up with my chopsticks :/ Really unfortunate since it seems to be the only sushi place in my area"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,My go to place for sushi rolls! Their rolls are huge and the service is excellent. My favorite is heat attack appetizer( korean style jalapeno poppers) sapporo roll and honey roll. They also have a section of deepfried rolls on the menu! Their food always look so  fresh and appetizing. Great presentation. Try the spicy sashimi bowl if you wanna try something new!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Just had a ""ramen"" delivered... All I'm going to say is, you're better off eating the instant ramen soup! First time I tried this place and I'm sure it will be the last."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Really expensive and the food proportions were small. I gave it 2 stars because of the location. But other than that I think there are better sushi restaurants out there this one. Plus, no parking around this place."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Sushi eaters beware. My family and I just ate here. My family ordered cooked items off the menu, and they were fine. I, on the other hand, ordered a sushi bento box, and the sushi made me incredibly ill. It did not taste bad, but the fact that I got sick made this a 2 star experience for me. I am not new to sushi at all, and frequently get sashimi at other restaurants. This time, however, my stomach is killing me. If you come to this restaurant, make sure you get cooked food."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I had the spicy sashimi bowl here and it was absolutely amazing. This restaurant is a Korean owned sushi restaurant and their food is really good. The spicy sashimi bowl is an authentic Korean dish made to perfection. 

I discovered this place yesterday and I'm already back today for more! 

Ignore all of the bad reviews. This place is good."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I put five stars on this review but it seems to have disappeared 
Anyways this place serves such wonderful sushi, the workers here are really friendly especially Chef Giho! The atmosphere here is very pleasant 
 my friends and I really enjoyed this place and will definitely come back for more"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Why did they offer to place a pick up order if they're not going to do it right?  We ordered the wonton ramen and the spicy ramen, both our ramen had no broth and the wonton ramen came with just 2 little wontons.  

It wasn't soup at all more like spice mushy noodles for $17  I think we will call them tomorrow since they were closing up when I arrived to pick up.   

I wouldn't recommend take out here :("
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Some pretty decent sushi and bowls in a beautiful location. The service here is efficient and lighting fast and the food is consistently tasty. Everything is on the expensive side but it isnt unreasonable, especially considering the location. Really fun lunch spot with good curry bowls. Would recomend for anyone looking for a quick lunch."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Spot: great
Food presentation: just ok
Food quality: just ok

Service quality: terrible."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Expensive sushi for an average taste. Tried their Hot and a spicy dumpling soup and that was so much better than the rest. It's in a huge shopping outlet so the price is obvious to be on the pricier side. Don't think it was worth the $$ for such average sushi.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Sometimes, I just have to have Japanese food.   I have tried them all.  Sushi Tyme has a great Sushi Chef in Mr. Chon.  The guy is an expert and if you have discriminating taste.. You will love the food.   You love Tuna.. You will love Chon's special touch.  If you enjoy Sashimi.. Don't go anywhere else.  My wife doesn't do Sushi but loves Teriyaki.  

You like Dragon Roll.. Honey Roll.. Then come here.   You like Sushi then this is the place.  Great service.. Friendly.. And so inexpensive for the quantity and quality. I don't get any negatives left unless it was by competitors.  

This is my favorite Sushi place in the greater Santa Barbara area."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Bra sushiställe,  vi provade sushi bento. Riset var inte top notch, men i övrigt nöjda (förutom något friterat som påminde om hash brown från ett dåligt snabbmatställe...)"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I'm from Los Angeles and I will definitely come back to Sushi Tyme for my next visit to Santa Barbara. 
Its a comfortable place to visit for a quick lunch or dinner, with fast service!!
I highly recommend getting Rainbow Roll and Hot Roll, one of the best sushi dishes there.
I give it a five star for its reasonable price for good quality of food and for their friendly service!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Cute little shop in Paseo Nuevo shopping center. Can't stop thinking about their tempura rolls. Limited vegetarian options but still excellent rolls.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Worst sushi place ever. The owner was very very rude and made us feel very uncomfortable the whole time we were there. The food was SO BAD. I'm pretty sure we got food poisoning from some bad fish. The place is dirty and not well kept. The city should step in and do sometimes about this place. It needs to be taken care of!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"This place is great! They are incredibly attuned and adaptive to my dietary restrictions, their service is great, and it's in an awesome location!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Good!  Service is good, food is good, location is good! I had the teriyaki bowl and the miso soup and some vegetable tempura. Definitely coming back!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,They've gotten better than before. It's right in the middle of state street by all the shopping center. I give it 4 stars because of appeal. The price and quantity is the same as other places. They're nigiri sushi which is like $17 (I think more) is delicious but it is somewhat pricey.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Went here because it was the only sushi place while we were walking around the mall. I was not impressed by the sushi. It seemed subpar. The teriyaki chicken seemed bland and dry. It could have used a little more teriyaki sauce. The salad that came with the bento box was delicious though. That was the best part of the meal. Overall the experience was 'Meh.' They did offer outdoor seating which is awesome.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,No bathroom.  Good sized rolls.  Ordering at the counter makes the tip awkward. Clean. Fresh shrimp tempura for my tiger roll.  Pay parking.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Very good sushi in the Paseo Nuevo. Miso soup was excellent, as were the ""805"" roll, 24/7 roll, and tiger roll. This has a lot of authentic Japanese cooking and is a great asset in Santa Barbara"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Tempura, Mexican roll and Chirashi in a boutique style mall. Can't  beat the sushi and the people watching."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Good sushi spot. My guess is they are always packed and busy inside but they quickly delivered my order. Prices were very affordable..the hot roll was delicious. I will definitely be back for a quick lunchtime roll.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"WARNING: do NOT order the ramen unless you want watered down, overpriced, instant noodles. Saw them carry out an empty box of individually packed shin ramen when taking out the trash. In regards to the sushi, it was pretty tasty. With that being said, the rice didn't stick to the roll too well and the baked items were hardly warm. A couple of the workers were pretty cold too. Would probably come here again just to get some quick sushi"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Pricey but what do u expect in Santa Barbara.   Sapporo big boy bottles are $9.95 each
Good food and very kid friendly.  Kids enjoyed their beef bowl.  $57 for a family of 4. Ouch!!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Worst experience. I asked them not to put green onion but it's still there. Most important, the ramen is not ramen at all! It's instant noodle! Look so cheap! 
Our dragon roll also come with just a tiny little picky of eel. 8 pics for 14 dollar! Only come by if you are too dying hungry to walk another meter."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Fast stop for lunch. Prices are pretty reasonable I get the vegetable ramen noddles it's my favorite. It's a little spicy so if your not a fan of spicy food make sure to ask for it mild. I also recommend to order one of the bento box specials they come with side salad and rice and vegetables.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"The food is really good here. I never ate something that I didn't like! The price isn't so bad for college students like me. This place is my go-to restaurant in santa barbara. I love the bento, tuna poki salad and crunchy roll. ITS SO GOOD. Oh, another interesting thing I asked about the spelling of this place, and apparently ""tyme"" is not misspelled, its a fruit that enhances flavors. Seemed like a lot of the reviews here were talking about how they misspelt ""time""!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Very casual and the sushi is good but not amazing. For some reason I'm having to go back and ask for wasabi at a lot of sushi places and noticed everyone around me also had to do it here, like there's some sort of wasabi shortage going on or something.

You order and pay all at once and then get your own chopsticks etc. but the courtyard is very pretty and it's a nice casual place for afternoon dining.  The chicken bento box was huge but nothing was close to authentic Japanese."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Great sushi. Really fresh fish. VERY NICE owner. Very welcoming. I love coming here for lunch. Can get a fantastic roll within 5 minutes of ordering. You should try this place out. I'm glad I did!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Very Good. Family restaurant. Big portions. The Dragon Roll and Protein are very big and tasty. It's a nice place. Worth the Money, we don't get that kind of shush in Miami."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Sushi was decent 
My order was made when I went to pick it up nothing too crazy tho it's like a fast food sushi spot"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,I would give it a 5. But the lady at the cash register is rude and it looks like she doesn't want to be there.  The man that works there is super friendly and nice ! And the food is very good I love the Mexican role and spicy ramen
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"We ordered out from here recently on SB Menus and I was so disappointed with the quality of the food. The fish itself was fine, but the rice was SO hard. At first I thought maybe it was just my roll since I got a ""baked"" roll but my boyfriend who had just gotten a simple California roll also had hard rice.It was almost inedible. For $16 a roll you have to be able to get the rice consistency right."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,I visit here all the time! Very good food. Very nice staff. Orders come out quickly and efficiently. All of the sushi is almost to pretty to eat.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Ok sushi. The chef makes the rolls too fast so the rolls fall apart on the plate. Sticky rice isn't very sticky. Fresh fish at least. Much better than Sakura sushi. Miso soup came very fast. Sushi came too fast. Good for lunch. Little pricy for the quality of food though. I'll come back.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Sushi was pretty good. We did the rainbow roll and lobster roll. Lobster roll kinda feel apart, but it was good. Service was friendly. This is kinda like a grab n go restaurant. Price was fair. I would go back."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,I've never had bland Japanese food until I came here. Had to douse my lobster roll with soy sauce.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Muito especial o menu! E ainda tinha uma brasileira no caixa- Bianca muito atenciosa! 
Eu vou voltar com certeza!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Sushi was okay. Ramen like cupanoodles. Prices on menu don't match prices that they charge - 7.95 ramen - cost 11.95. Wait the few extra hours and go to Arigato when it opens at 5:30.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"This location used to be called Sakura and had a similar menu. But the new owners have changed everything that matters for the better.

They now use the freshest ingredients and the best quality meats and seafood.

The Bento box is probably the best deal, but don't skip the other offerings. Their soft shell crab is the best I have had in the Santa Barbara area.

The owners are Korean and I just wish they could offer the tasty little appetizer dishes I loved when I was in Korea!

It is a small family place with very warm and friendly service. Give it a try if you have not been here with the new owners!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I think the best sushi place is here
If you want to get delicious roll, must go to there
I asked owner and she said that they always bring fresh salmon everyday.  I often order a sunshine roll and baked albacore roll. I love these combination

Nice cashier, nice place 
I definitely recommend"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Good sushi, the ramen was kind of ""Top Ramen"" esque, but the Udon noodles were good. Good prices too. Only thin was the staff was a little disinterested and not very helpful."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Very good service and great food. We really enjoyed the scallop roll and the catapillar roll
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,I agree with Robert B.  New owners/operators that prepare your sushi with fresh fish...superb talent in the art of preparing sushi at an extremely reasonable price.  I have been there several times for lunch or dinner and never disappointed.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"It's was delicious. I COULD NOT get enough of the -Heart Attack. My favorite !! If you like spicy, that's the one for you! We ate outside and had an overall great experience."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Not bad. The price is fair and size is suitable for girls. The location is so good that it's a nice place to have a light lunch when you feel tired shopping or exploring. Udon is better than ramen and it's better not to have the hot soup. The Japanese greeting from the chief really recalled my homesickness.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Pretty good. Better than sushi GoGo in harbor but same idea. Yellowtail and albacore sushi were tasty. G-special roll was also very good. Red dragon roll was decent. Good spot for when you want a quick sushi fix and some people watching. I will be back to try more.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Delicious smoked salmon roll. The front desk person was super sweet. The seating is mainly outside and a little tight/narrow.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I love going here with my family. The hot roll with jalapeño, spicy tuna and deep fried is might tasty. Almost all the rolls except for the baked salmon are my favorite."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I have been coming to this spot since I moved here, the sushi is of good quality, Abel, their chef is very talented and often greets customers. Lately, I've been ordering their ramen or udon, it's nothing special but I think it's great because it's not too heavy, sometimes it's best to have a light ramen broth around. Their udon is great though, sushi wise, I like their baked lobster roll. The staff.is very friendly"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Very nice! I visit here all the time and always I enjoyed.
I highly recommend this place! Baked lobster roll is my favorite"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Being that I work at Paseo Nuevo, I come here for lunch quite often. (Couple times a week) The staff is friendly, the food is good, and I appreciate how quickly the food comes out. Would recommend it to anybody strolling around the mall or downtown."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Not your typical sushi bar. You order your food at the counter then you go sit down and wait for the food to be brought to you. Not what I'm used to. I mean I don't know exactly what I want all at once when it comes to Sushi. I could order a couple things and then order a couple more in awhile. But once you pay if you  decide to eat more than you have to go back to the counter and order again and pay again. Kind of a little inconveniencing and  not traditional. Sushi was average. Kinda hidden away from state street .
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I recommend the sunshine rolls, delicious for a quick lunch break stop. Service was exceptionally friendly and speedy"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Yum yum yum the spicy sashimi bowl is very good! And great portions too! Customer service is on point too! If you some cheaper sushi at decent quality I recommend trying this place out!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Seriously, spicy ramen was straight out of instant ramen that you buy from asian market! so disappointed"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"This is the worst place I been to for a while.. 
The spicy ramen didnot even have real noodles. They used korean  instant noodle and they charged $8 for that joke! They charged for hot green tea and was very expensive for what it is. We will never go there ever again. I want my money back if posssible."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"This is probably the worst place i have ever eat . 
the kitchen is NOT clean and the everything is just OVERPRICED. they have Mosquitoes inside the sou sauce bottle, and the fishes are not so fresh. will
not eat there again ."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"The sashimi was tough and fishy. I was scared to even eat it, fearing it was old fish. The chicken tasted old and stringy as well. This is the kind of place you get food poisoning, do not eat here."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Yelp said no, your eyes said no, but as a slave of your tummy you went anyway. The first problem is the bad example Sushi Tyme set for grammar school students and for those of us who are trying to learn how to spell. 

I dyd not have a good tyme at sushy tyme. There are two thyngs however wych Y dyd apprechyate: servyce was fast, and the byll reflected the qualyty of the food. Y probably won't be back but you shouldn't lysten to me and try yt out for yourself."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"It definitely helps that this place is so centrally located, (and near my house). Even still, it's an easy choice for great tasting sushi. I have loved everything I've tried from the menu. And it doesn't cost as much as some other restaurants in town."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I don't know why my review got erased, but I'm posting another one because it's just that good. Food is great and service is great! I highly recommend this place! Ignore the bad reviews and come try it for yourself!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"We were looking for a sushi spot in the area, and this is one of the few available. The service was subpar, wait, there is no service here! You walk inside, order, get your water from a self-serve cooler. They forgot a glass of wine someone at our table ordered, and they forgot a bowl of rice for a hungry kid. The sushi tastes good but it's overpriced. And there's no bathroom, so if someone needs to go, there is a public restroom a block away, which is a bit creepy at night. I would say, if you are looking for a sushi experience in SB, definitely find another place. If you just want a quick roll before going out, this is safe."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"I've been a regular until now.  Not exactly high end sushi, but good and convenient.  Last weekend, while visiting my daughter in college we had lunch at Sushi Tyme - ordering the spicy tuna roll which was one of our favorites.  Unfortunately it arrived unusually spicy this time so we politely asked if the chef could remake it or perhaps we could try something else.  We were told absolutely ""no.""  We politely said that we've ordered and enjoyed the spicy tuna before but that this particular roll was considerably more spicy than usual.  We were told ""no""...  followed by a ""too bad, it's called spicy.""  I asked if the roll could be removed form our bill... and you guessed it ""no.""   So... will I be returning to Sushi Tyme?... ""no.""  Next weekend when I'm visiting my daughter, maybe we'll try Mexican."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Food came out fast. Friendly service. The food was pretty good. The sashimi was not super fresh or else I'd have given 5 stars.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Food taste bad, and I ordered two meal to go they only offer just one pair of chopsticks. I ordered combos, but one of them is lack of dumplings."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"The food was good but the system they have with serving the food was terrible. I had ordered a Philadelphia roll and my dad had ordered a spicy California roll, and then my mom had ordered a baked salmon roll. Each orders came at different times which I understand is common at sushi restaurants but I still hate it. On top of that (this is the worst part) they put TWO ORDERS (Philadelphia roll and spicy California roll) on THE SAME PLATE. So they gave a plate to my dad and so my dad was eating both of them without even realizing some of them were mine. By the time we realized It, there were only 4 Philadelphia rolls left for me. I was completely deprived of my sushi, so I had to order another roll which was ANOTHER $8 for something I should have gotten on a separate plate in the first place. What is this system? It's stupid. They should fix it and place each order on a different plate. So confusing and annoying. Never coming here again."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"This is a cozy sushi place in Santa Barbara. Special rolls which I like the most was grate, King Kong roll, Volcano roll, avocado hand roll and cucumber roll along with miso  soup I eat! (We share the food!!! Yes) all was grate. I would recommend this place if you are in this area and have appetite for sushi."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Sushi Tyme is a great sushi Resturant in the Paseo shopping center. I got the Dragon Roll and Honey Roll. They were both really good with nice sweet and savory combination. The ambience of this restaurant is good. I like the decor and music within the restaurant. I recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area that likes good sushi.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,So When I entered this restaurant  it was in a mall so I didn't expect an amazing vibe or amazing food but boy was I wrong! First of all the vibe in here was excellent it made me wanna keep staying! Next I ordered a whole bunch of rolls with my friends and our favorite was the Sapparo and Tiger Roll! They were delicious! Everything else was delicious but those 2 stuck out the most so the next time you go here I recommend these two choices! The workers here are also nice with extrodinary service! They would always stop by and check if we need anything! So overall I give it 2 thumbs up!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Great sushi place for a cute warm restaurant with lots of options and nice people. As a vegan it's hard to find many opinions for sushi but this place has a lot. It's the only vegan udon I've found in town.  The miso is great and I love the cucumber avocado and vegetable roll.  Also the girls who work here are super friendly and always love when I bring my dog.  Overall super friendly and good food!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Service was good,  and dishes prepared quickly. The dishes are basically fast - food, mall quality. If you don't go there expecting more than that,  you'll be fine."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"It was a nice little sushi place which I used to enjoy when I first moved to this area. It is a little pricey but the quantity of each dish compensates. However, during my visit today, I ordered Angie Roll which I really liked, but the quantity and quality of the food is so bad this time! I used to get salad along with the sushi, but this time I barely got any and the sushi shrinks so much with very little salmon and spice tuna in it. They also replaced the Mayo with soy sauce. Very disappointing."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"We loved this place! Grant it, it was the only sushi spot we tried in SB. BUT sushi is our favorite food and this place did not disappoint. The SALMON LOVER ROLL was by far our favorite. We tried two other rolls and they were good too. 

The service is fast. You order before you sit and then they bring out the food to you. Don't forget to tip at the register since they do bring your food to you. This isn't really a fancy sushi spot- it's more of a casual location but the food is the real winner. 

Worth it. If you haven't gone, try it."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,A hiole in the  wall  place  that serves good sushi  and other Japanese food at resonable prices.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Cute little restaurant in Downtown SB.

Located in a little plaza on State Street this restaurant is a prime area filled with shops, eateries, movie theaters, etc.  Parking is conveniently located in public pay parking structures as well in the Paseo parking lot below the plaza.  

The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating.  There seemed to be more seats outside then there were inside. Inside was crammed with less than 10 people.  During our visit at about 5:15 p.m., there were about 10 people inside the restaurant and a few outside.

The vibe outside was relaxed and fun as you could people watch in the plaza.  Inside felt a little stuffy.

The menu was both on the wall as well as on laminated paper.  You order at the counter and your food is brought to you.  The menu contained sushi items, appetizers, udon, ramen, bento boxes, salads, and beverages.  We noticed a freezer filled with a cute Japanese desert in various flavors and Japanese beverages in the refrigerator.  We ordered tofu udon, a bento box, Miso soup, and edamame. The bill was over $30.00.

Our food was brought out quickly and presented well on Japanese plates.  Taste was standard.  Portion size was on the small side.

Service was average.  

There was no restroom.

Rounding off from a 3.4, this visit scored a three."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"I'm disgusted by something I witnessed today. A young lady asked for special dietary requests for her order, as is customary to do in a restaurant...order food the way you want it!!!

The nasty BEAST OF AN OWNER berates and curses at this beautiful girl, tells her not to come back to the restaurant because she's JEWISH!!! SHE ASKS FOR TOO MANY CHANGES!!! When she's asks for her money back in exchange for her leaving, he says it's too late, the food is out of the kitchen. He has A BROOM AND COMES AT HER AND STARTS TO SWEEP HER FEET! She asked him if he's trying to sweep her feet and he said he's just cleaning. She had her phone out and he said if she's taking pictures she'll be in trouble! He was threatening this poor girl!!! This was discrimination, profiling, bad business manners, intimidation, inciting fear, implying threat, wrong on every level!!!! I will NEVER SET FOOT I THAT PLACE EVER!!! He's a fucking nightmare and I hope she files a police report! He needs anger management and now!!!
Who the hell does he thing he is???"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Me and my friend went here and it was a great experience. Their sushi are incredible and I would love to comeback again. They have friendly staff and also incredible food. Stop by and eat some of their delicious Sushis! Thank you!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,After eating lunch my family and I went shopping and went for dinner... We decided to try this new sushi Tyme restaurant and the servers cracked some jokes which made us laugh and it had a very positive atmosphere. The food was delicious and very filling. I barely Yelp but this restaurant was worth yelping about. I highly recommend this place
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Avoid this place at all costs. Top price, sit down dinner, so so food and refuse to let you use bathroom. I overlooked everything till I got sick to my stomach and was about to vomit and they said go to Starbucks across the street our bathroom is for employees only. Avoid this dump."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"The food is very good compared to most places, but it is a bit pricey. I can deal with that but the way the run their restaurant is very rude. Paying before you get your food and then never speaking or checking up on you again? Asking for sauce and them saying that'll be extra... after you already just paid. These people do not know what hospitality is."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"I used to order vegetable teriyaki bowls from this place, and they were good. They usually used carrots, broccoli, and red peppers on top of white rice with a delicious sauce. Well, I called today to order the same thing. They didn't mention on the phone that a vegetable bowl was no longer on the menu. Well, obviously they don't know how to make a vegetable teriyaki bowl because half of the bowl was filled with LETTUCE. If I wanted a salad I would not have gone to a sushi restaurant! The 3 pieces of broccoli and 1 slice of carrot were very good, and the rice and sauce still taste as good as ever. They put just a DRIZZLE of teriyaki sauce on and then charged me for extra. They used to be skimpy with the sauce, but they didn't used to charge me for it. I don't know why they would remove a veggie teriyaki bowel from their menu or why they didn't ask me on the phone what type of vegetables I wanted in a vegetable teriyaki bowl. Oh well. I guess that won't be my go to place for a veggie bowl anymore."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Really great sushi and good location for downtown shopping on State street and in Paseo Nuevo but VERY over priced. One roll can be up to $15 for this quick grab and go enviroment. The rolls are great and service is fast but very expensive
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Really great stop! Amazing food for good prices. Location is busy but we were able to sit down and enjoy our meal. Will be coming again!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"The food is pretty good tasting. It's just not consistent and they scrimp on ingredients. The first time I was there, the rice was cooked perfectly, I went back the same day with a friend, and bit into several hard, undercooked grains. Also, not sure why they put such a small amount of wasabi on your plate. You'll have to ask for more. In fact, they also scrimp on sauces. I ordered a teriyaki bowl and there was a small amount on top, but all of the rice and veggies were dry. Finally, I also had a caterpillar roll (with eel), and although it was tasty, it was mostly rice with VERY little eel. The California Roll is also tasty, but it falls apart easily.  I must say that the food is a GREAT improvement over Sakura (there b4). One thing makes me a little suspicious that it's just a remodeled space though rather than being under new ownership, and that is the review about the veggie tempura being mostly fired onion rings. The final straw for me at Sakura was that dish! A soggy bowl of onion rings that they called veggie tempura. If they address the issues that people have been posting, I'll be back to this site to give the restaurant more stars."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Had the bento chicken lunch and the chicken was dry and not tasty. The sushi was good and tempura was average. Cost is average. Service was great. I use to get the bento box from the previous place and loved it. Maybe they had an off day but I was bummed about the chicken teriyaki and sauce. Looks much nicer inside now.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Hands down one of my favorite spots for sushi in SB! Quick, delicious and amazing service. I love how welcoming the staff is here!!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"A really delightful experience,a quality sushi spot in Santa Barbara.I sat at the table and ordered the sushi bento and roll.HONESTY,everything was so fresh.SO GOOD!!The staff was friendly,service was fast..Will definitely come here again!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I had the teriyaki chicken bowl, it was amazing... The chicken was juicy, the salad was great, top quality greens... We went during the Covid-19 Pandemic, we placed our order waited outside and the lady brought our food to us... Staff was friendly and nice, and made sure that we had everything that we needed... We definitely will be back..."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"I came here with a couple of coworkers today. We thought this place would have improved after its time as Sakura. We thought wrong.

I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl. Rice was dry. Chicken was dry. Veggies were dry. Hell, sauce was dry. Have you ever felt desiccated after eating? Have you ever felt desiccated after eating food with a sauce? Yeah, that was my experience. I basically consumed a desert. A bowl of sand. Sand with rice.

I'm giving this place a 2/5 'cause it was just 2 dry for a $9 teriyaki bowl."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,LOVE this spot so much! Spicy ramen is the best and California rolls are amazing. Can also never go wrong with the gyoza. I literally CRAVE it! YUUUMM!!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,SLOW service.  I think I waited 40 minutes already for 2 rolls.   A bit ridiculous.  They've still not arrived (I'm at their restaurant).
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,This is a great quick stop sushi restaurant especially if you're visiting Paseo Nuevo. The service is quick and the cashier is very friendly and knowledgeable about the whole menu. I had a G-Special roll here and it was really tasty and had good presentation. Come through!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I am very picky when it comes to eating sushi.  There are only few chef I would trust to handle my sushi. Sushi Tyme isn't a fancy place but the sushi they serve is well cut and very fresh! I am always delighted by the portion they serve also for the price I pay. I learned the owner, the chef was a head chef in one of the first class hotel in Las Vegas, no wonder the food they serve is not ordinary, this restaurant knows what they are doing! As picky as I am about my sushi, i keep coming back to enjoy my well cut and fresh sushi.  When it comes to sushi, the cuts and freshness is the most important factors. If you don't want to break your wallet and still enjoy first class sushi, this is the place for you!  JC, the picky eater."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Really enjoyed their Teriyaki Salmon Bowl!! Great service, good food; I'm definitely gonna come again :P hahah. Since there's not many great Asian restaurants in Santa Barbara, I'm really glad that I found this place!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"This place is crazy overpriced for what it is. The quality is actually pretty good, which I want at the top of this review so it doesn't go overseen, but the actual location which is a tiny building with limited outdoor seating makes it feel lower than fast food. I ordered 3 rolls and a bowl of miso soup for 2 people to split (which is usually enough for us at other sushi places) and cost around $35. While that isn't much money, the amount of sushi we got was the real eye opener. We left still hungry and unsatisfied, and will most definitely not go back"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Our Thanksgiving dinner plans fell through, and we were stuck wandering through downtown Santa Barbara, wondering what to do for dinner.  Sushi Tyme saved the day!  (We are not particularly Thanksgiving traditionalists, especially this year, but we just wanted a nice meal to take out and eat in the backyard.)  We ordered rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll, Chicken teriyaki bento box, salmon teriyaki bowl and everything was fresh and delicious.  Thank you, Sushi Tyme chefs and front desk staff, for making this Thanksgiving awesome!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Quick little sushi place. It's kind of expensive for the quality of the food. But if you're hungry and walking up and down state and don't want to wait forever at a restaurant you should come here.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"First meal in Santa Barbara. Not bad at all. We ordered a hot night roll, spicy tuna roll, philly roll, and a chirashi bowl.

Reasonably priced since the restaurant is in the middle of downtown SB within the mall

We had to dine outside since you know - COVID. Nice breeze and their patio seating was comfy."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Mexican roll is the best here and I most definitely would recommend getting it! The crunchy roll is really good too!

I always get chicken katsu here. They give a good amount  of chicken. I opt out on getting the curry sauce and just stick to eel sauce and siracha. 

It is a bit pricey but the food is good and worth it."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Sushi was just great
The Sapporo roll is delicious 
Service for great
We enjoyed it a lot 
First time my daughter ate tuna sushi and loved it"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,This place is okay if you're just getting a quick bite. They're cheap that's why I come and just expect that much. I used to like tempura crunch shrimp roll but a while ago they changed it to use bread crumb instead of tempura crunch which is kind of deceiving so I'm not getting that ever again.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Nothing very extraordinary about this place. It's pretty much like all the other sushi places in SB. And it's a very small restaurant by the way.

The quality of the fish is ok. They do have a decent selection of rolls, but I feel like the rolls tasted pretty similar. Maybe just the sauces they put on top make it taste a little different."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Had a wonderful little lunch here today.  We thought the sushi was great.   We had a couple salads and two rolls.   The fish was fresh, the salads were as well.  Very nice for a little ""fast food"" style sushi place.   It was very busy and our food was delivered quickly."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Spotted this place while we were walking around. Very quick service and food was good. Ordered two rolls, tempura appetizer and miso soup. Average prices for everything. Would definitely go back."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,consistantly amazing! Sushi tyme is our go to take out during covid. Awesome staff and rolls!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"As I stated previously the fish is super fresh & crisp here. It's a great spot for sushi to-go or at ANY time of day because they are open ALL DAY as opposed to all the other sushi restaurants in SB who close after 12:00pm.  They are reliable and consistent. The sushi chef is super friendly and I always feel cared about coming here.

--They got rid of the awful chick from CO (unfortunately I knew too much about her from overhearing her conversations about her personal life.) 

She was evil and for no reason at all! (I tipped 20%) She gave me dirty looks the entire time I was eating) SHE'S GONE THOUGH! Thank God. Bc this place ROCKS."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Why did I do that? :(

I heard the food wasn't good. Then I heard the ownership changed and it was better. 

My opinion? Don't go!!!!

Wow.
So disappointing. My bento box took forever  to be served. Plus there wasn't much space so I shared a table with another girl. (She was cool).

Bento box $11 (you can add miso soup for $1).
Omg the chicken was boiled or something. Just very bland. Barely any sauce. It grosses me out just thinking about it.
The California roll was gross. Generic.
My veggie tempura was basically a side of onion rings... Haha. Really! 
The salad was meh.

Just don't go. I warned you."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Do not go here if you expect to get your food in a timely fashion. I ordered a bento box and salmon sashimi and a shrimp tempura roll and it took over 1 hour to get my food.  

Tip. If you can only serve a few orders at a time. You should let know people ordering in advance that there is a backup in the kitchen. 

Horrible!!!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"We were hungry and passed by for a quick roll but ended up ordering a roll and the mussels. They were so good that we ordered another roll and more mussels! The mussels were amazing, some of the best we've had at sushi places of similar value. We also go the shrimp tempura roll which was good and then the lobster tempura roll which was awesome!

Definitely worth stopping by for a snack if you're hungry after shopping!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I've only been to this restaurant twice but it's actually quite good! The only downside is that their eel is REALLY dry and hard. I order a roll that was supposed to have eel and avocado on top and oh boy, the eel was super hard and very chewy instead of melting in my mouth. Overall, I do like this place but I'd stay away from sushi rolls with eel."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Good sushi. Ordered spicy tuna rolls and Hot night for Doordash and they were great! I docked three stars off is because of my ""ramen"" order - which turned out to be cheap packaged Shin Ramyun with 3 tiny pieces or pork belly and an egg. I don't mind this, but please don't charge $10 for this dish when it's literally $2 instant ramen which I had sitting in my pantry anyway. You didn't even attempt to make your own broth at least... you used the ramen packaged seasoning it came with. Please specify this in the doordash name for the item as well... as this is really not the authentic ""ramen"" that it gives the impression to be."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"A hidden gem! My favorite is the G-Special, it has spicy tuna (that's gotten pretty spicy lately but I don't mind!) and avocado along with tempura shrimp and topped with these crunchy little rice things...it's amazing! I could and want to eat two but I'd be so full! I love this place and appreciate the focus on just really fresh and excellent food. If you love sushi, this is the place to go."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"So We wandered into this shady small looking Sushi place. And I ordered ramen. KEEP IN MIND U PAY UPFRONT, shady m8. For some reason they only had spicy ramen. Hmmmmmmmmm. They didn't have normal ramen broth , only spicy for some reason. I wonder whyyyyy.... is it because they only have spicy packaged ramen in stock and they just add a fu*kin egg and some frozen beef to the instant ramen and called that shit beef ramen? Ramen looks like instant ramen when I got it. I'm very disappointed. Prices aren't reasonable. I literally paid 9 bucks for a pack of instant ramen. I'm so sad. The chef in the back ground touched somewhere else with his glove before putting it back on the sushi that he was making. Unsanitary too? What if he scratched his ass before putting his hands back on your food? Disgusting I wanted to dip but my aunt was hungry. So we Ordered the bulgogi too, the beef was so rough and the rice was so hard . Bruh was I eating like some kind of flavored sh*t, how long was that beef in the morgue. Going back there might put me in a morgue too and they r gonna use my corpse for ""chicken ramen"" bruh I swear I'm so mad."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"We had a terrible lunch Wednesday, May 1 we're regulars there but I won't be coming anymore the soup was cold there was no water to drink the salad had no dressing and the kitchen help made an ugly face when we asked for something the place has really gone down hill We felt that we were treated badly also"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,I can't believe I paid $13 for what looked and tasted like instant ramen.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"My mom and I were so excited for our food but were completely disappointed when we got it. In my bowl, a coarse black hair was cooked in my shrimp tempera. We showed the server and she brought out a new bowl but she was unapologetic and seemed annoyed. Then the chef came out and it was obviously his hair because he had black coarse hair & no hair net despite having medium length hair. Then, my mom was eating her food & bit down on a metal wire! We showed the server and she took the metal, walked to the kitchen, & never came back to our table. We waited for 10 minutes for her to do something. We left very disappointed. Don't come here. Horrible service & unsanitary. Will be reporting to the health department."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"SHAME ON THEIR RAMEN. This the disgrace of Japanese Ramen, Japanese food, and Japanese culture. I ordered hot&spicy ramen with cost of $8.75 and I tipped them at the very beginning when I payed my order(Before service). I expected an answer that why they used instant noodle to serve their customers and never feel anything wrong with it. Why would I come to a restaurant to order a bowl of instant noodle that I can make at home in three minutes? ? ?

It was the first time in my life that I complained on the food I got. I went to the front desk and told the waitress that I was confused that they made the ramen from instant noodle. She told me that is what they serve and they are not required to tell us that from their menu. When I expressed my disappointment, she just looked at me, I had to ask and she said ""What am I supposed to say?"" Excuse me? It is the first time I met a waitress like this. And when I talked to the manger, who also claimed that that's what they serve anyway, and he also said, ""I do not know what to say"" . 

It 's just extremely disappointing that they are happy with the instant noodle they serve when they claimed that they provide RAMEN. And never feel sorry when their customer wish to have an explanation. Worst experience in my life."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Good food great service. The rolls were so really good. Our server was so sweet I didn't get her name but I brought my son yesterday for his birthday and it was her birthday too! Such a great dining experience we will be back next time we're in SB
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,We came here for the first time today and I loved it! The cashier was very friendly and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered the eel and avo roll and spicy tuna roll and my husband had 2 of the California crunch roll. Everything was really yummy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my husband wasn't loving his order as much as I was.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I went there over the 4th of july weekend and thought nothing more of this little shop when we first walked in. But wow i was really surprised when the food came out! It was rly delicious actually. We got dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, and this roll with the rice crispies which i forgot but a hidden gem. Theres also a patio, might bring my dog next time!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"I decided to try sushi tyme based on a roommate's recommendation. I was iffy to go because she's from the Midwest and I'm from Guam (think California:: Mexican food, as Guam:: Japanese food). I was disappointed that I didn't go with my gut. 

It satisfies the sushi craving, sort of but lackluster is the best way I can describe my roll - mr. Protein. Price and quality just didn't do it for me. For cheaper sushi with similar quality, I'd recommend Something's Fishy. For pricier sushi (by $3-4), Yume Sushi will surely hit the spot."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Great outdoor dining spot during pandemic times. There is plenty of outdoor seating right outside the doors. This tiny façade doesn't have much indoor dining space anyway. Each person in my group ordered their own bento box and I ordered a baked salmon roll and shrimp tempura roll for the table. 

Everything tasted as it should. The fish on the sushi was fresh. The rice texture and consistency was perfect. The spicy tofu in my bento had the perfect crunch and a delicious sweet and spicy sauce.

For dessert, walk across the street to McConnell's for ice cream."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"3.5 stars. Very on the fence whether to round up or down. This place is located in a Santa Barbara outdoor mall/strip where you can choose from a variety of restaurants, to eat outdoors in a socially distant way. 
I ordered two rolls, which was loudly advertised in the front as being $11.95, I got a philly roll minus cream cheese (which is a salmon avocado roll) and a unagi avocado roll. The food came out fast and the sushi was average-good. 

But unfortunately I had to take off some points for the following:
The cashier was extremely unknowledgeable. I asked if they offered a salmon avocado roll, the cashier said I could order the salmon roll and add avocado for extra. Well, I wanted to stick to the 2 rolls for $11.95 offer and not pay extrat so I saw on the menu the philly roll contained salmon, avocado, and cream cheese. I asked if the philly roll was smoked or raw salmon. See in most sushi restaurants, the philidelphia roll is a fusion creation meant to mimic a smoked salmon bagel experience-smoked salmon, cream cheese, cucumber. The cashier replied: ""the rolls are all smoked salmon."" Me: ""...all the salmon is smoked?"" I started to wonder if weirdly, this sushi restaurant doesnt do raw fish. And then the cashier turned around and talked to the other people and said, ""Oh, I meant, all the salmon is raw."" Me: ""Oh. So can I just get the philly roll minus the cream cheese?"" Him: ""yes"". So I was able to order the salmon avocado roll without paying for extra avocado using what was already offered on the menu. They should just put a salmon avocado roll on the menu. 

I got my receipt and waited outside. Luckily for me, my dad always instilled in me that I have to double check receipts. I saw that the cashier didn't charge me for the 2 rolls for $11.95. Instead he charged me for two rolls a la carte at $7 each, so $14 before tax and tip. I was confused so I walked back in and showed it to him. It was a mistake and the cashier corrected it and refunded me, but I shouldn't have had to make sure I am not overcharged. Especially since this restaurant literally advertises on a big sign that their 2 roll special is just $11.95, so it was the least unusual choice on the menu, and yet it was entered incorrectly by the cashier in a way that overcharged me. I had to take a few stars off for that."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Very cute boutique sushi shop inside El Paseo shopping center, with plenty of patio seating so its a perfect rest stop. SB is very dog friendly so our four legged friends can get some water and rest easy under the umbrellas too! 

Their sushi is very fresh, never had a complaint, and I've had their signature rolls as well as regular nirigis, always on point."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Great food, whether you prefer nigiri, rolls, teriyaki, or curry, you're going to love this place. Friendly service, perfect place for people watching. I come here often."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I wanted to update my review as my last 3 orders from this restaurant have been super satisfying! Their spicy tuna rolls are superb and perhaps the best filling-to-rice ratio in the area. Same goes for my boyfriend, he refuses to eat spicy tuna rolls anywhere else. If I remember correctly he wanted to these spicy tuna rolls everyday for lunch for 4 days straight. I'm a big fan of their portions as well - I hope this never changes! They offer a good amount of wasabi but be sure to make a note for more ginger if you're a ginger fan like me. Overall good value sushi place!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"The Sushi here is delicious!  I had a special cheese roll that had a delicious mix of seafood in it.  The mall set up outdoor tables for the restaurants to serve diners.  Everything seems to be controlled as they clean frequently, have social distancing rules and they wear facemasks.  The guys serving are good looking too.  I totally trust this restaurant.  It was a good experience."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I was hungry while shopping in Paseo Nuevo mall one day and wanted something quick and light, so I decided to try this place on a whim. You'd expect bad sushi, since it's a tiny shop in a shopping mall, but it was delicious! I was so surprised. I went back shortly thereafter with my family after telling them how great it was. My husband was hesitant because, like I said, you don't expect much from sushi in a mall. But now they are addicted, we go here about once a week. The owners know us now, and are very nice to our young kids. 

There's not much room inside, but outside seating is so enjoyable anyway, it doesn't matter."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Solid food. We order delivery from here a lot. My complaint is they REALY skimp on the ginger...we order 7 rolls and only got 2 tiny containers or ginger/wasabi. It happened before and I thought it was a one off but now it is a trend. 

July 7th: same thing happened again. We order 5 rolls and even asked for extra but the delivery came with only a single container of ginger and no wasabi. Real bummer as we like their rolls."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,So sad to hear about the fire and difficulties  facing Sushi Tyme! Such a wonderful restaurant. Prices are fair and the food is always delicious. Wishing Sushi Tyme a speedy road to recovery
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"My go-to casual sushi in Santa Barbara. I love the spicy tuna roll! The quality is consistent (not the most incredible highest grade fish ever but it's definitely fresh and satisfactory, and it's because it's well-priced). The staff members have always been respectful and friendly!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Always so happy to find myself here! Amazing food, great customer service and affordable prices. I always enjoy the wasabi lemon tuna roll, the spicy rainbow roll, the tasty eggs and the salmon lover roll. Very fresh, very tasty! Treat yourself!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Judge for yourself. This was 98 dollars worth of sushi here. 

Absolutely a complete rip off."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I love this place for fresh sashimi and sushi rolls! Staffs are very friendly and welcoming and tip is appreciated but not necessary since you order and pay first. Especially their spicy sashimi bowl is a great post workout meal, healthy, lots of protein and veggies! I usually have their spicy sashimi bowl like 3times a week after my workout and I'm still not over it!!"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"It was Christmas afternoon, this is the only restaurant that's open in the whole town, we pretty much had no choice, my mom and I had some food in the car on the way there, so we ordered one plate to share, we asked for hot water, the cashier answered me with two fingers ""2 hot water?"", but ended brought us only one cup without any explanation. While eating, my mom wanted something hot to warm up the body, so I ordered another Tofu Ramen, I then asked for another cup of hot water, but being rejected for the reason of not having enough cup, and I needed to bring the cup to the cashier if I wanted more hot water (I wondered what I am paying the 15% tip for?) when I brought the cup to the cashier, I saw another exactly same cup sitting right next to the water kettle, I asked the cashier why not give us that cup, he answered ""that's not what you think."" So I wondered what's exactly what I saw???
When he brought the hot water (with the cup I brought over) back to the table, I decided to ask him if it's because we only ordered one plate? He said no, and he further claimed he didn't not charge me for the hot water which is actually not free. 
And came the tofu ramen made with instant noodles you can get from the super market....
All the above ruined our Christmas Day."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,I had a pretty good experience when I came here for lunch. Tried ramen for the first time and it was spicy and delicious. Very small and cozy place.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Sushi is ok. Service is fairly quick. They do not accept American Express. I think in this day and age if you want to be a competitive business you need to provide for the wants of your clientele.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,I love this place in the mall. The teriyaki bowls are delicious. Miso soup is so good & it's a great place to pick up for take out. I have had the rolls all the time!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"That's probably the cheapest Japanese food you can find in Santa Barbara that serves decent food.

I often eat there whenever I need to grab something to eat while shopping in paseo. Their rolls tastes good, as well as their chicken curry bowl, my favorite.

The lady at the counter is very nice and always smiling, even though she doesn't speak English that well she'll do everything to get your order right. However, once served, there is no ""waiter"" present, since the restaurant is very small, it's more of a to-go / take out kind of place vibe so don't expect a refill on your water!

Side note: Don't drink the tap water they have, I believe they just pour unfiltered tap water into the water fountain."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,I Dont know what i ate. The sushi made me really sick after i got home. The bulgogi i ordered was really rough. Not a legit place to eat. Dont make sushi or ramen or bulgogi if u r half assed on the japanese and korean side of the menu. what a disgrace. i literally sat on the toilet for 2 hours...
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"I've ordered 3 kinds of sushi and I've asked for extra ginger, and I've got this. It's not ok to not follow up on customers' requests!!! So disappointed:(("
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I've been here several times and always left satisfied. The staff is warm and friendly and they make sure everything served is to your liking. 

It's very small inside with limited seating but very cozy. They do have outside dining which is always nice on a sunny day. They are located in the paseo nuevo outdoor shopping mall. 

I brought my son here for the first time and he loved it! He ordered the plain udon noodle soup. This came with broccoli and red peppers. I tried a sample of it and the broth was really good! I'll definitely be back for the spicy udon. 

I ordered the tempura Cali roll which I haven't tried yet and it was fantastic! Crunchy, warm, and full of flavor. I loved the drizzle of sauces on the rolls. They were a perfect compliment to the sushi. 

I've also had the Mexican roll before and chicken teriyaki bento box. Both satisfying. 

To be honest prices are pretty steep and that's why I don't come here as often as I'd like. But it's always a treat when I can splurge! 

Give this place a try if your in the mood for sushi after a long day of shopping."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,I ordered from this place spent $100. They grouped up all the rolls & put one little scoop of wasabi in each tray. I called them & they said they made a mistake & will call me back. Nothing........ I really liked this place. Sushi Teri takes care of you go there.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,The Ramen and the Bento Box were horrible. Stick to the sushi. Sushi chef was good! The Ramen was nothing more than a noodle cup from 99c store.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Spent $85 worth on food. Expected it to be enough for 3 people and barley looked like it was enough for 1 person.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,The sushi here was great in portion size and flavor was pretty good- it was a lil more citrusy than I expected. Would say this place can get busy at lunch time so call in your order soon to get lunch quick!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I really like this little place. It's located in Paseo Nuevo and has some tables outside. The menu is pretty typical and covers all the basics from rolls, ramen, bento boxes etc. Right now they're running a special of two regular rolls for $11.95. I ordered one Philadelphia roll and one eel roll. The rolls were good, but the price point shows you the portion size that you'll get. For example the Philly rolls had smaller pieces of salmon in them and the eel rolls had smaller pieces of eel.
Don't get me wrong, the flavor was there and it was good but this is a perfect example of you get what you pay for. I wouldn't hesitate to visit this place again and try some of their other menu items."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Hole in the wall. Not a posh service place. But sushi is at a reasonable price, and tasting great! 

Highly recommend the Sushi Tyne specials-- the waitress was super knowledgable with recommendation. 

Description didn't do the roles justice, refer to pictures!! 

Edit-- 
Minus 1 star: they made my loco tako bowl way to salty-- make sure to specify how salty you want it. 

Minus 1 star: They gave me extra white steam rice instead of remaking it with sushi rice"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"We were in town for a couple nights and my Girlfriend and I were craving sushi. Found this place online and it was fairly close to where we were staying. The greeting was welcoming but ended up paying $50 for rolls that were way to small for the price. I don't like giving disappointing reviews but the Sushi rolls were tiny and didn't have that fresh taste.
Then charged $3.50 for a can of coke!
Overpriced for what you get.
Ended up going to Sushi GoGo the next day and got more for the buck and fresher flavor."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,Honestly no clue how the food is but the girl working the register needs to be fired. I'm fairly sure she was stoned out of her mind. I did a good delivery there and waited for like 15 minutes for her to pack up the food I needed while it was already ready after she knew I was just standing there waiting. While I was there I watched her handle a call in order horribly but messing up the order like twice and asking the person to repeat it 3 times before she could mentally handle it I guess. I also saw her boss or some other co worker talk to her about how she's messing something up. Idk what it was about but I know it was bc she wasn't doing good. I also saw 2 customers come in and and she was literally so out of touch with reality. Like she had them repeat their order multiple times and she literally froze like a statue for like 20 seconds after they said they wanted to order the same thing. It was super weird and the customers were weirded out. And then when together paid in cash I saw her mess up giving change twice before she got it right. Also every customer order I watched her take she didn't give them a number meaning she made them take out even though they were for dining in and I know that bc some lady came in complaining about how she never got an number and how she was waiting for her food when it had been ready sitting in a to go back before I even got there. She's trash and should get fired. Wish I told her that when I was there. Personally I wasn't that bothered except that the longer I wait the more potential money I'm missing out on and what I watched while I was waiting was embarrassing and not professional at all
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Ate here the other day and wasn't expecting much but holy motha...it was damn good! Much better than a couple of the near by sushi places that are much more pricey! Will go again...and again and maybe again!
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"SUSHI TYME is finally reopen from yesterday with clean and handsome interior.
It has been a while for us to wait for reopening the store."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"I used to love this sushi spot but unfortunetely it has completely gone downhill. The last few times that I have eaten here, the SERVICE and QUALITY of the fish have both been POOR. My most recent experience was the worst one yet. I ordered a King Kong roll to-go and waited 40 minutes. The hostess/cashier initially said that the roll would take about 10ish minutes. When I asked about the status of my order around 20 minutes she said that my order was taking a long time because it had to be fried. No apologies or ETA, it more so seemed like I was bothering her so I continued to wait outside as I really didn't want to bother them or have them thinking I was a bad customer. Given that this one roll was over $15, the service was awful, and the roll was so small and unappetizing looking, I DO NOT recommend coming here. There are many great sushi restaurants in this area and this is not one of them. This was a huge waste of my money and time. Please see the attached picture."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Every sushi roll or dish I've tried here is absolutely delicious, fair prices, i highly recommend this place 10/10"
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"I've been to Sachi on Chapala and Kai on State Street, but didn't realize there was a sushi place inside Paseo Nuevo until pretty much now. Came in with Japanese comfort food in mind, but left with an order of rolls as well.

Tempura Udon - Love how the soup was packaged in a separate container, Sushi Ai in Goleta did not do the same for my takeout recently, and it was a soggy mess. Thank you thank you thank you. The udon by itself isn't expensive, but the toppings are an easy $3-4 extra. Options include Chicken, Gyoza, Pork Belly, Seafood, or Steak. The Mixed Tempura was a good choice, the vegetables were fried nicely and the shrimp was tasty. Wish they just had a simple beef udon.

Chicken Teriyaki Bento - This was a feast. Sweet glazed slices of chicken laying on a bed of rice, with a side salad and an orange slice to go along with it. It also comes with six California rolls, two fried gyozas, and a (potato? sorry I forgot) croquette. Very filling compared to the soups, and more variety compared to the rice bowls. For additional $$, you can have an extra serving of beef, chicken, or tempura.

Sweet Crunch Shrimp Roll - premium version of the Shrimp Tempura Roll essentially. Very similar ingredients: shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, avocado, sweet soy. Not too sure if it was worth it, I might've just gone with the regular one instead.
Small interior with only space for a few to socially distance. Outside area is nice to sit on warm days, with umbrellas providing shade."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"The new girl from Colorado working cashier is absolutely awful. She makes the entire business look bad. However, I think the quality of the food has improved compared to recent years."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,negative,"Very mediocre food, make sure you don't order those ""ramen"" because they are basically instant noodles with an egg in it."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Mexican roll is the best here and I most definitely would recommend getting it! The crunchy roll is really good too!

I always get chicken katsu here. They give a good amount  of chicken. I opt out on getting the curry sauce and just stick to eel sauce and siracha. 

It is a bit pricey but the food is good and worth it."
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,Solid food. We order delivery from here a lot. My complaint is they REALY skimp on the ginger...we order 7 rolls and only got 2 tiny containers or ginger/wasabi. It happened before and I thought it was a one off but now it is a trend.
XwnkfMUiyH-OsJXbmbOK5g,Sushi Tyme,Japanese,positive,"Amazing Lil sushi spot right off state street! The Salmon Nigiri was top notch and so was the King Kong, Tasty Ex, heart attack and crispy rice! Everything was amazing though!!!"
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,negative,"This place...exists? It's in a building alongside Courtyard Café, underneath a UCSB parking lot past the Engineering building, oceanside. It's quite hard to find if you don't come regularly.

Anyways when I ordered my beef a la carte (I'm on low carb), the cashier lady who didn't understand English very well tried to get my name for the order and it was a struggle. I had to spell out G-E-O-R-G-E three times before she just gave up and just spelt it as ""Georte,"" which was quite amusing in my opinion. At least after I waited for my name to be called, she stopped the cook from swindling me by switching the kiddie sized petri dish and hooking me up with a big takeout-sized platter of beef. Props for making up for the spelling mistake with lots of food. 

Back to the actual review. Most people don't know that this place even exists on campus, but all the engineering students like me, do. Even then, expect long lines of engineering peeps and the seats being mostly taken. However, the order was finished fairly quickly. 

Most of their items cost more than the Panda Express in the Hub, while portions are smaller. For example, the takeout plates that I saw were about half the size of what you'd get for a 2 entree 1 side Panda express, where you'd pay $7 to $9 for most entrees, or $5 for the a la carte that I got. 

Beef was pretty standard like other Yoshinoyas, it's kind of oily without the rice and noodles, but I like it greasy and tender as a Keto person. Comes with grilled onions. 

Decent place. Filled me enough, and the service was good in that one instance. I didn't like how the backroom chefs could be so stingy though."
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,positive,"This place is my go-to when I'm working and hungry. I used to get the combo bowl which comes with rice and steamed vegetables, along with angus beef and steak but now I get the combo bowl with bbq ribs and the grilled tilapia. The grilled tilapia is delicious with lemon and white rice with soy sauce. It's quick, easy and good"
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,positive,"Best beef w rice ever !!! 
Clean location, it's a courtyard so it's shared. Plenty of seating. 
And the woman at the front is so sweet."
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,positive,"The hidden gem that should probably stop giving. 

There aren't any Yoshinoyas in so many miles and it definitely does help alleviate the Yoshinoya cravings but it's gonna be the funkiest Yoshinoya you have ever eaten. If you're having those cravings by all means go for it otherwise stay away. Just go to Yoshinoya when you go back home for the holidays."
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,positive,"It's Yoshinoya, I wouldn't expect the best quality nor best service. However the lady at the counter was very nice. As for the food, its pretty consistent to other Yoshinoyas. The portions are not bad."
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,negative,Okay I love yoshinoya but this one is NOT THAT GOOD. I have a soft spot for yoshinoya cause of my childhood but idk this one just isnt the same as the one back home. I even feel like the portions are smaller. Just don't come here
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,negative,"Not too many people know there's a Yoshinoya on campus. It's underneath Lot 10, next to the Courtyard Cafe. I really like eating in this area because it's not as crowded. 

I like the lady who works there, she's very nice. It's kind of weird ordering here, you go to the Yoshinoya register first to tell her your order, then she prints out a receipt, and then you have to wait in another line to another cashier to actually pay. They don't accept the money I have in my student ID like other restaurants on campus, so I have to pay with my debit card. Then that cashier gives you your recipe back with a Paid stamp, and then you go back to claim your order. 

The teriyaki chicken and beef are acceptable to eat. It tastes like any other location. There's too much rice leftover, and not a lot of meat. I paid $5.61 for the beef and $6.90 for the chicken, which is quite expensive. 

I claimed a birthday reward recently (free teriyaki bowl with purchase of drink) and paid $2 for my meal, which was nice. I'll probably think twice about eating here again."
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,negative,Pretty bad tasting beef bowls. A very cheap way to eat food. Food is definitely not worth the money. Too expensive for its portion and quality.
cVW9b_1bqsvTU1jhGNWUsw,Yoshinoya,Japanese,negative,"The only on-campus restaurant (other than Panda) that serves Chinese food is Yoshinoya. As a chain restaurant, the quality of food usually remains the same throughout different branches. The food comes out hot. The beef and chicken and marinated like how they usually are. There are no surprises. 
However, the service here is a lot better than other places. The cashier (an old Asian woman) works hard to memorize names of regular customers and to properly type up the names of customers correctly. She asked me twice how to spell my name and after I got my order, she asked me again. I can tell she really cares about her role as a cashier and taking names down as the customer wants it. Thus, the service is amazing and worth coming here rather than other fast-food places on campus."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Always crowded but how can you blame them? Last time I went in here I met 2 famous people at the bar and had the best sushi of my life! oh yea and waited 2 hours....
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Whenever we want the best sushi in town we have to come here. We almost always get the sashimi and sushi combination, along with a couple different orders of nigiri. 

Always amazing and worth the high price."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,I waited to get a table. I feel like it takes forever even there was a lot of table. This bar is so dark. The table was still sticky and that sauce plate was also dirty. Sushi is okay but not great. I don't like the service and the atmospheres in the restaurant. Everything was so slow and it likes the waiter didn't see you when you really need to order. I don't want to go back here again.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"this place has the most amazing sushi i have ever tasted. the rolls are unique and you can't find them elsewhere. the bill will be high, but it is so worth it. this is one of the places i miss the most because i have moved back to the bay area. and even with the unlimited sushi places here, i doubt i will ever find a place like Sakana. 

however, if you ever order take out, make sure to check the box. once, i was given someone else's order, but luckily i checked before i drove away. they gave me a complimentary edamame :-)."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Best sushi we have ever had. Very friendly service too.  Try the Toro press box.  Also the coconut curry mango shrimp.  Prices are a little higher but worth it.  We got there before 5 and beat the crowd.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Really delicious and fresh fish. One of the best sushi restaurants I've ever tried. The place is exceptionally small, so going with a large group of people is not ideal."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Best sushi in SB! They don't take reservations so you may have to wait a bit for a table depending on the day of the week.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best sushi I have ever had, in my life. One of my favorite restaurants. This sushi is what dreams are made of!! The rolls and sauces are so unique and taste amazing. They are on the pricier side compared to your average sushi restaurant, but not by much. We are talking a $1-$3 increase per roll at Sakana. That few dollars is well worth the quality, taste, and experience a million times over. The rolls at Sakana are larger and more full of fish as well, so I get full faster. I cannot rave enough about this place. There's sometimes a long wait, because it is a small restaurant but it is worth it. Try going right at opening (5:00 on weekends) to be sat right away. Also- Merry Go Round Roll. You won't be disappointed."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is my favorite sushi bar in all of SB! Not the biggest sushi bar but can fit a good amount of people comfortably. They do not take reservations so try to come early. It is a bit pricey but well worth the cost. They offer three tyoes of rolls, hand roll, regualr roll, and box roll (without seaweed) The portions are big and lots of flavor! I recommend the Spicy Tuna Roll or Rainbow roll!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Hands down, my favorite sushi restaurant. Enough said. Always fresh and the service is always great."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"No idea why this place is so highly-favoured by other people - I've had loads of great, authentic and inexpensive Japanese food at other places before and this place simply disappoints. $23 for a lunch box set consisting of a few measly pieces of chicken smothered in cloying teriyaki sauce, disappointing tempura that wasn't even very cripsy at all, and spicy tuna rolls that were only so-so. If you really want good Japanese food, look elsewhere, this place has a posh interior and posh people frequent it but evidently they haven't got good taste for Japanese food."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I love this place more and more each time I come. 
Last night I tried, finally, one of the press boxes: the Montecito. 

OMG. Lobster, crab meat, bits of caviar with this lobster sauce and other gorgeous , colorful sauces in the plate. 

This is not even fine dining sushi. It's artwork you eat. 

Worth the waits though last night no one outside at 8 PM. Still about 10-15 before we got a table but who cares? 

This place is my favorite sushi in ALL of America."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This was my second time visiting Sakana in a short time period. The first time, I was told by a friend who has traveled throughout the US and the world that it's the BEST sushi he's ever had...I was quite skeptical, especially upon pulling into the strip mall in which Sakana is located. But then I looked at the menu and OMG...it truly is one of the best places I've been. You must get the crispy fillo encrusted sea bass. Its so so delicious and unique. Also, anything with salmon is amazing- very buttery and fresh. The textures are just so refreshing and the combination of herbs, dipping sauces and sushi boxes are amazing. I will probably go to Sakana every time I'm in the area....its just THAT good!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This place is amazing!  The food is ALWAYS good and the sauces are amazing.
Service is fantastic every time and fast.  Every time has been great and I love this place.

What's sad are loser people who go online, write a review after having eaten at this location one time and not tried everything, and trash a restaurant such as this.  Sorry, Jerry, your review was misinformed and you sound like a classless moron.  Please stay away from Sakana.  They don't need you to come back, which all in all is good newsfor me...more sushi for those who love it!  YUM SAKANA!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"How have I waited so long to write a review of this place?! 

Before I had three jobs, I would come here four says a week for lunch and at least once a week for dinner. Anytime I can fit it into my busy schedule, I come here to dine. Lunches can be quick. Dinners can be leisurely. The quality and the consistency keep me hooked. They have traditional sushi items, specialty items, salads, and a whole array of interesting Japanese fare. 

I highly recommend ANY of their press box rolls (blackened yellowtail), and their aburi yellow tail sushi is like an orgasm in your mouth. If you are a modest eater, it's not crazy expensive. However, everything is SO yummy, that it's hard not to order everything your heart desires. That can get pricey..... But you won't be disappointed.

All of the staff: waitresses, chefs, Marcos (the man) are SO nice and attentive. I've honestly never had a bad experience there. I've never even had a so-so experience there. 

The blackened yellowtail press box is my ""last meal"" request, if ever such a request need be made. I moved to Maui for two years and thought about this dish on a near daily basis. It may have been about 25% of the reason I moved back to Montecito. 

Go there. If you don't, you wont ever know what the best sushi tastes like (in America).

That is all"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"One star
 for a nice chef.
The glass display have precooked shrimps, imitation crabmeat premixed, different type of fishes stack on the same plate & many many plastic container, yeap all these in the glass display.
Scallop is slimy, fish not fresh...sorry but honestly I feel like throwing up.  Went home got some m&m to clear the nasty after taste.
I was Arigato Sushi for 1 1/2 hours last night, every plate was so fresh and unique delicious.

My 3 plates are slimy & nasty, not once I see the 2 chefs take the cold fish in the glass case as he prepared over 20 plates in front of me."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best sushi restaurant! Sakana has the yummiest rolls and press boxes. My favorites are the light and healthy, mozzarella red wine eel and the habanero yt melt. For an appetizer you have to get the misozuke or poke salad. Their chirashi entree and salmon belly are also bomb. Besides the food, the staff, sushi chefs and owners are the best ever! The restaurant is small so be patient and don't be afraid to sit at the bar, which I prefer over the tables."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,My favorite sushi restaurant - hands down the best in town.  I would even go as far as saying it's the best sushi I have ever had.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"The Merry-Go-Round is hands down my favorite sushi roll in Santa Barbara.  Great ambiance.  It's intimate so a great place for a date, but definitely not good place  for parties larger than 6.  Bar none the best plate presentation of any sushi bar in town.

They also have an amazing seaweed salad.

Good service.

No reservations.  Weekdays are not too bad of a wait.  If the wait is long I usually just give them my number and drive to Lucky's for a drink until the table is ready."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Loved the scallop roll, so creative. It was all delicious. Small restaurant, great atmosphere and not astronomically priced. If we come back to the area, we'll be back!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I love sushi. Sakana isn't traditional sushi because it features sauce-based sushi dishes. Don't come here expecting sashimi. It is a real treat and although it is very expensive and difficult to get seating (don't even THINK about coming here with a group larger than 4. Even a group of 2 will have trouble getting seated), it is totally worth it."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,I went here and the food was amazing. They take so much detail into preparing your food. Everything is amazing there. I would definitely refer this to anybody that likes sushi!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Quaint, cozy little sushi spot hidden in a corner of Montecito. I would say it's the best sushi in the Santa Barbara area for sure. I usually get sashimi so just raw fish with no rice or seaweed, that's the best to really taste the quality and freshness of their fish and their fish is truly fresh. I feel like I am tasting the ocean in my mouth, in the best way possible. And their house sake is great! Goes well with the sashimi I usually get."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,Don't be cheated - this is an American restaurant. Too much salad dressing on every dish. The only good thing is the uni.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"The good: The rolls were beautifully plated.
The not-so-good: We arrived just before 9 pm, about 1/2 hour in advance of closing. The place was fairly full. We informed the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday. After seating at the bar, we were told that last call for ordering was in ten minutes. No problem, we ordered a number of selections to try, both from the board and from the server's recommendations, along with some premium sake and beer. There was no eye contact from the chef. Suddenly there was the mop and its related chemical smell as we tried to eat the rolls they'd just brought us. It's fine to take down the fish case if the restaurant is closing, but spraying the glass as customers are eating on just the other side of that glass? The point is to enjoy the fused flavors in the rolls, not the chemical being sprayed. There was no birthday acknowledgment of any kind, not even a small piece of sushi to try from the chef. In the end, we were gulping down our meal and chugging our drinks just to get away from the chemical smell. 
You folks seated us and served us. If you wanted to close, then tell us before seating us. You knew it was a birthday--couldn't you have suggested we go elsewhere if you'd soon be mopping and spraying? 
My dining companion had never been to Sakana and I wanted to show off the charm of the small place. Instead we felt rushed and in the way--and worst of all, could not fully enjoy the flavors of the pricey meal.
I was sorry I'd chosen to go there."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Had lunch with a friend at Sakana on Friday. Best service EVER by Megan served with the best sushi EVER!! Sakana has spoiled me to other sushi restaurants. It's a high bar that they need to reach. Only other place that comes close is Nobu. But not close enough. I love you Sakana!!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"After reading the reviews, we decided to go there. But the restaurant is not that impressive at all. The place is very small. Spaces between talbes are very tide. The food isn't that great either. We ordered edemame. But I can tell it is not freshly cooked but rather from left overs because I worked at Japanese restaurant before. So I can tell the edemame is dry. Then the california roll is dry too. The price of this restaurant is very expensive compare to other Japanese restaurant, but the food is not justified for the price. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will definitely not visit this place again."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"After reading all the over-the-top reviews, maybe my expectations were a little inflated, but I think this place though fine is way overrated.  The appetizers we had -- beef teriyaki and stuffed (with crab) mushrooms -- were excellent.  But the main show -- spider roll, mango roll and a ""Louisiana"" roll -- were not too out of the ordinary.  The latter had cream cheese in it -- which, though I have seen it done before, is to me an abomination.  But most disappointingly, brown rice was used in all the rolls, which gave them all a non-welcome flavor and lack of cohesiveness.

The presentations were very artistic, but the dollops of green, and orange, yellow, and red that went into them were ""sauces,"" many of them spicy, that they take pride in.  But since when does sushi have ""sauces"" or anything with it besides soy sauce, wasabi, and ginger?  What up?

Anyways, not bad, but I wouldn't go back again; Arigato Sushi on State Street, though probably more expensive, is my choice in Santa Barbara."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Fantastic.  We are huge sushi fans (and snobs), and this place is amazing.  The ok sushi is as good as most places, the fantastic peices are a step beyond.  My favorite was the hamachi and Blackened Yellowtail (with mango).  Damnnnnn.  Prices are high, but totally worth it.  Place is packed."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I am very picky about my stars and I only give 5 to exception dining experiences. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a yelp hater, but I think 4 stars is excellent. I would give'em 4,5 if It was possible!!
I had a dinner date with my husband today and it was awesome. Hands down best sushi in Santa Barbara so far (we've tried about 4 places downtown).
We got there (Saturday around 7:45pm), there was a line, but since it was only the 2 of us there was a table available right away.
The restaurant was packed but we still got excellent service! (Thanks, Sheena). The food came out in a timely manner and everything was delicious!!!
I def recommend the garlic soy edamames, the miso soup (devine) and the yellow tail melt press box. Btw, it was my first time having the so call pressed box roll and I loved it!!!!
Anyways, don't hesitate to come to Sakana, you won't regret it! I can't wait to have an excuse to go back again."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Absolutely amazing dinner tonight!  Came here tonight with my son. Came because all the great yelp reviews.  Sashimi was tasty .  The Black widow was a winner.  The press box spicy tuna on crispy rice was really fresh. The service was 5 stars and the fish was fresh and tasty.  The presentation of all the rolls was very artistic.  Easy parking.  I am from LA and consider myself a sushi expert.  I will definitely come back every time I am here in Santa Barbara. I would give 10 stars!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"AMAZING, You can't get these sauces anywhere else. The sushi is already great with out the sauces, but then they put that on top, you don't even need soy sauce. I have even seen people lick the plates! It is practically a whole in the wall, which makes it perfect for a cute date. I have tried sushi all over CA and you can't get better sushi than this. My personal favorite is the Hanabi roll. I suggest going with a group around 6:00 PM because after this the place gets very crowded due to their small space. I would suggest them to put 4 or 5 tables outside during the warm summer months."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Their sushi is fresh and delicious. Their creative rolls are just one of the reason this sushi bar is different from the rest. There is not much space so I recommend going a bit earlier to put your name down for a table especially if it is a Friday or Saturday night.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I came here recently for a work-related dinner.
I love that it is tucked far away in a little corner, which makes for quieter dining than another ""innovative"" sushi place in Santa Barbara.

Which brings me to my next point: Sakana is great for interesting roll and sauce combinations. There are more traditional rolls and sushi, but go for the unique menu items to appreciate what Sakana does best.

The Montecito roll and the Merry-go-round seemed to be the hot picks for the evening. Throw in a few others, add some hot tea and cold sake, and we were happy.

Presentation is really great. The sauces are beautifully presented on the platter. Definitely picture-worthy, if I'd had my camera with me.

There are no reservations here, it's first come, first served, and they would prefer not to seat you until your full party has arrived. Friends have happily waited an hour or two for their seats. But my group got lucky and were seated immediately. Good times."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Every dish of the six we ordered were absolutely delicious! Our sever Jenna was kind, helpful, and called a taxi for us while we finished our sake. Definitely a fantastic place to have a Devine sushi fusion experience. Delectable !"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This place is by far the best sushi place in SB! The press boxes are all amazing. The Montecito and the mozzarella red wine eel melt boxes are great! The sauces are all original, colorful and makes the quality sushi just that much better. Highly recommended"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"BEST sushi ever!!!! I'm addicted! Always fresh and very unique options! Seriously, it's the place to be!! 
talk about YUMMMMMMMY!!!! ...& They're open for lunch too!! Dinner opens up @5pm.. Get there early cause this place is popular! ...wait time!? No worries!! You can chill on the front patio enjoying the amazing sake! Hot or cold!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Picky sushi eaters may find things a little fishy, and might do better to stick with rolls.  The Sakana roll is worth trying.

They offer an extensive sake selection, including brands that don't have US distributorship."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best Sushi I have ever had. I don't know if i would just call it sushi, because it's so much more. I would consider myself a sushi connoisseur, lived in Japan for two years, had sushi in San Fran, San Diego, LA, Florida, and all over. I know a lot of people complain and say this isn't ""traditional sushi"" like they actually know what they are talking about. So i'll tell you, traditional sushi is plain fish on rice or a roll with one fish in it. There is only so far you can go with flavor when dealing with a piece of fish with no sauce on it. Americanized sushi tastes so much better....period. 
      At Sakana my girlfriend and I got the Pink Bear roll (amazing, made love to my taste buds), the Garlic Albacore (melts in your mouth, delicious), habanero yellowtail belly (still in amazement), Lobster Melt roll (filling but so much flavor its like a flavor bomb went off in your mouth). The last roll wasn't my favorite and my girlfriend didn't really like it, it was the blue fin specialty roll they had.
      This place has really good sauce-sushi combinations, and I love spicy so this was right up my alley. My girlfriend and I are going back again for our second day in a row. As for price, we got all of this for $59 so it was actually cheaper than I expected it to be."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is the best Sushi place I've ever been to. Every time I come to SB I HAVE to take a trip here. It's expensive, but worth every penny. I see people complaining about the service, but I've never felt that way. I always sit at the sushi bar and order everything from the chefs. Must go!! The White Dragon is amazing!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Their press boxes are amazing! I highly recommend the sakana tower, yellowtail habanero melt and the crunchy box! Delicious sushi and friendly service."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Habanero Melt Roll, Unbelievable. All the flavors are incredible. Some of the best Sushi I have ever had. A lot of people on here are saying that it was not an authentic experience, while the star of the menu is certainly all of the rolls they have invented (which they should be) They CERTAINLY have all the traditional sushi and rolls as well."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Simply amazing rolls.  I grew up in Santa Barbara and make it home 2-3 times a year and ALWAYS go to Sakana.  A great meal every time.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Fantastic sushi - each piece fresh (often a sushi restaurant has some fresh, some not so fresh), great lunch combo (I recommend the salmon roll), friendly service.  Prices are fair - quality sushi shouldn't be cheap"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Amazing place. Definitely for a date night, celebration, or special occasion, even if that means celebrating your day off! I sat at the sushi bar, but the staff is amazing, Sophie & Krista took great care of me, along with the busser/kitchen pro/etc, Marco, they make you feel at home and are SUPER attentive and friendly. 10/10 and would definitely recommend to anyone! :)"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Amazing! Best sushi of my life! So good, so fresh, so tasty! Sauces are awesome! Get there early or late, it's always packed. It's on the pricey side just fyi but so worth it!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Hands down the best sushi in Santa Barbara! From the rolls, to the press boxes, to the wokked edamame... Everything is perfect here. Don't be discouraged if there is a wait, it is totally worth it!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"It's simple..... Best sushi and sashimi I have ever had!  The plates were served in an unbelievable artistic arrangement.  Perfect presentation, perfect flavors.
As good as it gets."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,My friends are I went to Sakana based on a friend's recommendation. This is the best sushi place i've been to hands down! The fish was so fresh. Everything was tasty and cook to perfection. I wish i didn't live 5 hours away but i'll definitively go back there everything i go to Santa Barbara.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is my most favorite sushi place. I didn't like sushi but after coming here this place got me into it. 

All of the specialty rolls that I've had are DELICIOUS. My favorite one of all is the habanero yellowtail melt. 

It is a smaller restaurant so depending on the size of your party or the time you go you may have to wait awhile. There is a nice ambiance with blue lighting and a TV screen of some tropical fish."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"One of the best I have ever ate at for sushi. Chefs are great and knowledgeable and professional, servers are great and quick, the decor is lovely , fish is fresh .. I can't say anymore than that. It's that
Good!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I was very disappointed in this establishment. Firstly the place is not very welcoming with a sign right when you walk in that says you will not be seated unless you are part of a party. I ordered take out and ""my mistake"" ordered the wrong item. I drove home and realized I had the wrong item and drove back (15 min drive). They then proceeded to tell me that I had to pay half of the original item that I wanted because it was ""my mistake"" and they couldn't do anything with the roll that I didn't want. The hostess then proceeded to tell me that the owner/manager would for sure charge me when I ask to talk to them and she ""was trying to do me a favor."" I was astonished! I proceeded to ask for the manager and she then went and talked to her and low and behold I wasn't charged the $7.50... then I was then belittled and told ""that they would do it just this once."" I mean c'mon regardless of who's mistake it was are you really that greedy? I also heard this hostess proceed to tell another man that was ordering take out that he would have to pay for more of the ginger relish... He had ordered 5 boxes of food... the least you could do is give him the damn ginger w/out charging him for it. The seafood is not fresh and the portions are very small. I'm bummed that this place is so unprofessional. The chain sushi place that I use to go to would give you way more fresh fish for half the price."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is very difficult for me to write because there are two incredible sushi restaurants in Santa Barbara. Arigato and Sakana. After years of procrastination I finally tried Sakana, and it was the best I've ever had. The fresh ingredients, imaginative menu and impeccable service all came together perfectly. The lengthy menu is endless with both its traditional and nouveau offerings. It is frequently compared to Nobu, and you can instantly see why. The atmosphere is intimate yet lively, but never in a ""noisy"" way (my biggest critique of Arigato). The small room has both tables and bar seating, and they don't take reservations so we arrived around 6:30 and the place was already at full capacity.
I must give a shout to our wonderful waitress Kat, who gave us the best service and had the best suggestions off the menu.
If you go, get there early. They'll let you leave your cell # if you want to wander about."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"At the very least, the best creative sushi bar with fresh fish to back it up.  It's comparable to Arigato in price and presentation, but Sakana is the no brainer winner between the two.  

A must try: Habenero Yellowtail Melt press roll.  Don't let the habenero in the name fool you though - none of their rolls are that spicy.  

I really liked the Black Widow roll too.  It's a fancy spider roll, which I typically don't like, but the tempura asparagus & unagi on top were a nice touch.

All of their rolls come with very colorful sauces that don't necessarily compliment the order, but it sure looks very pretty.  Try each sauce individually before diving in.

There's an ama-ebi appetizer that comes with a sauce topping & bits of caviar that I really liked, but my friends were split 50/50 on that one (some thought it was better the traditional way, without all the extra fuss).  In general, their menu offers both fancy & creative sushi, as well as traditional favorites, so there's something for whatever pleases your palate. 

The sushi is always fresh and the best in SB that I have had (although Arigato is a close second with their raw fish selection).  My favorite thing to order here is the Japanese Hotate nigiri... super soft and soooo deliciously tasty.  It's never fishy, and it never disappoints! 

Oh yeah, and one time Penelope Cruz & Javier Bardem sat down at the table next to my friends & I.  It was hard to resist the inner groupie in me and force myself to behave while they contemplated their order!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Excellent!  The sushi was fresh and high quality the teriyaki was amazing.  Service was fast and friendly. Highly recommended.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is definitely the best sushi bar in Santa Barbara because the fish is so fresh!  I'm only giving it four stars because it is on the expensive side. The long menu can be a a little daunting, but the friendly staff is always there to help. I am more of a traditional sushi fan, but if you love to try different sauces and flavor combinations, then you're in for a treat. The yellowtail melt and the live uni will keep me coming back for more!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I'm a sushi aficionado, eat it at least once a week. I almost never write yelp reviews. Felt compelled. This was one of my top 5 experiences - better than Nobu last month. Ordered an 8 piece chef's selection as well as various other rolls - the nigiri had some of the freshest pieces of fish I've ever tasted, and portions or ample (almost too large on the Aji :-)"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I wish I could throw up!  The worst sushi I have ever come upon. I don't know how they are still in business serving that horrible food. I thought ordering teriyaki chicken would be safe for my son. Boy was I wrong!  It tasted like they took the gravy from dog food and put it on his chicken!  Then I was served some kind of box roll called the Montecito. I took one look at it and knew it shouldn't be consumed by anyone. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I took one bite and paid dearly for that. It tasted like watery Dijon and poppy seed on raw fish! Ahhhhhh!  The other rolls we had (can't recall their names) were all equally terrible. Weird sauces and mushy seafood combinations come to mind when I am forced to remember those awful rolls. The best part of the meal was the moment I was able to leave. If you choose to eat here, eat at your own risk."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Frankly, there's a new sheriff in town.  The common wisdom holds that Arrigato has the best sushi in town, but I believe that the torch has been passed.  Arrigato, you've been put on notice!

A recent trip cemented this idea in my head with a bit of blue fin tuna on rice with a habanero slice and a bit of spicy something or other.  Other dishes ordered by my companions were equally delicious, even if I can't remember their names.  One appetizer that did stick out:  the edamame wokked in soy sauce was sinfully delicious.  I also liked my seaweed salad over tuna, served neatly in a martini glass.

One tiny problem with Sakana:  menu anxiety.  At four pages of small type, it is probably impossible to feel a sense of peace about your selection.  The remedy, however, couldn't be simpler.  1.  Set aside boat loads of money.  2. Set aside a month of sushi gluttony and go nuts."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Love this place! I have only had the opportunity to visit once but it was fantastic! No sushi will ever compare. There was a wait but it was well worth it.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"The food is great. Sakana roll, half and half, habanero yellow tail melt press roll and the and jalapeños blue fin tuna were amazing. It gets packed, go early or call ahead. Service was okay - they need more staff. But it's worth the wait."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is my favorite sushi restauarant in California!  I live in Orange County and there were several times when I drove to Sakana just to have dinner and then head back to OC.  The food is amazing!  Its a small restuarant and the location is hard to find but it is worth it.  I travel to Japan over 10 times last year and the quality of sushi at Sakana is comparable.  I enjoy sitting at the sushi bar and asking the sushi chef to surprise me and create something new.  It always turns out really good!  I would definitely continue coming back to Sakana.

I just visited Sakana again this weekend and wanted to updated my review.  I had three muskateer oysters topped with sea urchin, caviar, basil oil, habanero, truffle mango vinaigrette, oysters on half shell, mango blackened bluefin and Dijon toro- wasabi dijon toro, asparagus, avocado with blackfin tuna, mango. Whoa!  The food was amazing!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I frequented Sakana almost every month during my undergraduate years at UCSB, and I regret nothing; this place was worth how frugal I needed to be to splurge on dinner here. The atmosphere is great for those seeking a balance of intimacy and sociability-- not too quiet, not too loud, and contained in a ""small-enough"" dining area that sustains this balance. The fish is fresh and sushi and rolls are artistically garnished with their signature sauces, adding a strong visual component to your tasting experience. The sushi chefs behind the bar are your guides in your experience here and it is to your benefit to interact with them because the extensive menu here can be a bit intimidating your first time here. If you're looking for sushi in the 805, definitely give Sakana a visit."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"DELICIOUS SUSHI. Which is all I could ever want. My boyfriend on the other hand, doesnt eat fish. That is the reason this is not 100% a 5 star rating. He got the chicken teriyaki last time we came and he said it was one of the worst meals hes ever had. Unfortunately, its a bit pricey so I cant convince him to go back with me just to watch me love my food while he hates his."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"We love Japanese food and we have great sushi restaurants in the bay area so we had high expectations coming here. In our opinion, Arigato's on state street is still better. 

Black widow (soft shell crab, avocado, etc) : Good 
Red dragon (tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado topped with eel): OK the eel was a bit fishy
Habanero yellowtail pressed roll: This was my favorite roll. It definitely had a kick to it but it was delicious. 
Spicy tuna roll: Ok it was spicy so that was good
Sake nigiri: Ok. One salmon we didn't eat because it looked old as it had tints of grey on it.     
Chicken udon (just as it sounds chicken and udon noodles): blah dish. It would have been nice to have at least egg or onions in it. 

Total damage: $75 

Overall verdict: Just OK with the exception of the habanero yellowtail pressed roll."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"They have a huge menu and everything is unique and delicious. Great atmosphere, pretty waitresses. enough said."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Wow is all I can say about this place. I have eaten at many Sushi spots and this one is perhaps the best of them all. A bit pricey yes, but well worth it. The extensive menu, the presentation, and of course the sushi was top notch!!  I'll be back the next time I'm in town!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana.... The best sushi/fusion place this side of sushi heaven (Ventura Blvd). The press boxes are amazing, and sushi and sashimi is always hi-quality. This isn't a traditional sushi restaurant, so if that's what you want look elsewhere. If you want good food, you wont be disappointed."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Try the Habanero Yellowtail!  It's sooooo good.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I am actually considering paying for an entire road trip from San Francisco to Santa Barbara JUST to eat dinner at Sakana. This place is on another level - and I cannot imagine another restaurant getting close to the quality, creativity, and ambience that Sakana offers its diners. My boyfriend and I would plan date nights at Sakana regularly and stop for ice cream afterwards in the adorable downtown Montecito. Each time we would order different rolls and each time, my expectations were surpassed. HANDS DOWN THE BEST SUSHI I HAVE EVER HAD. thanks Sakana - we miss you!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Really quite good sushi rolls.  The press boxes are excellent- hard to describe, just enjoy selecting which ones and try them. Great service. Small dining room, so likely will wait for a table."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Very high quality fish. Truly one of the best I have experienced. Will go there again for sure.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I know this is Montecito, but some of the prices at Sakana feel really high to me.  The sushi rice is a little mushy, but the fish is fresh.  The execution of sushi rice is a big deal to me, and the mushiness is pretty noticeable.  I think the best items are the creative little nigiri.  They aren't traditional, but they are tasty.  Even with high prices and mushy rice, I still go back, so there you go."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"First and foremost let me say that this is the BEST sushi I have ever had in the 805. 

You can literally taste the freshness and quality of the fish it's insane! 

The sushi platters itself look like colorful works of art with all the delicious dipping sauces (I know I tasted basil somewhere! lol) 

I heard it was small but had no idea it was THAT SMALL (no joke)

If you want a seat arrive early I am NOT KIDDING IT'S TINY! (I guess that makes it more intimate..hehe)

It's not your run of the mill average joe kinda hangout (think Montecito Elite)

Nonetheless 

*SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH

*FOOD IS FABULOUS

-MUST HAVES:

-Montecito roll

-Habenero Yellowtail Melt press roll

-Spicy Tuna roll

-Lobster Melt roll


Oh and they gave me Tempura Ice Cream as a Birthday Favor! SO SWEET =] 


LOVE IT HERE!



BEST SUSHI HANDS DOWN!!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Literally the best sushi known to mankind. 
The Yellowtail Melt is a veritable cornucopia of flavor that will undoubtedly give you a mouthgasm. 
Try out the Champagne Fluke for a tender, rich taste that will make your eyes roll back.
The merry-go-round will feel like tiny mystical creatures dancing a magical jig on your taste buds.
And always end the night with another yellowtail melt, it's just the morally right thing to do.

You won't be sorry.

P.S. Legend has it that every bite of Nao's Sushi will add an extra hour to your life.

I hope that is true... I go here so much, I'm probably just about immortal."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Best sushi in the santa Barbara area! Make sure to order the spicy tuna on crispy rice.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"hands down my favorite sushi spot. Have been coming here since it opened years ago. The owners are so sweet and are always in the restaurant making sure things run smoothly. The press box rolls are all amazing, and defiantly use the highest quality fish. Make sure to go on off hours, either show up when they open, or com a little later otherwise this little spot will usually have a 30-45 min wait."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"For a sushi place in Montecito, I was expecting MORE. All the employees were very nice and accommodating. I noticed they were quick to clean tables once customers left BUT they are definitely understaffed. My boyfriend and I came by during my lunch and it took 25 minutes (after he ordered) to get our first roll. The spicy tuna was also not spicy at all and it had a really weird consistency. It kind of made me sad considering I work 5 minutes away and when I need a ""sushi pick-me-up"" I was hoping this would be my ""it"" place. I'm super disappointed..."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"So good...I can't wait to go back. It is a tad expensive but so worth it. This is probably my favorite sushi place I've ever been to. They really pride themselves with their sauces and have very creative plate displays. Like another commenter, I almost do not want to review because the place is hard to get into as it is (sorta small) but if you are visiting and craving some sushi, don't pass this place up!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"After hearing great things about this place, my son and I decided to check it out.  It was early Thursday evening, it was busy, but not packed when we arrived, so we sat at the counter and watched as the rolls we ordered were prepared; the food tasted fresh and was terrific, the presentation great with dipping sauces that were an explosion of savory flavors.  We thought the servers and sushi chefs at the counter were all very pleasant.  The place is small, unassuming and rather simple, but the food was worth the trip from Ventura.  We will be back!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Fantastic but overpriced. Unless you're rolling in dough, which is not a bad bet if you're in Montecito, you might leave Sakana a little hungry. Very small on the inside but worth the somewhat cramped environment for top notch sushi. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for sushi and you're feeling like splurging."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,Mediocre sushi. Appetizers are a joke - overpriced and portion sizes are ridiculously small (forget about sharing). Sunomono appetizer was barely a couple of spoonfuls. It's trendy allright - this place is for you if you just want to be seen and don't care about getting quality food for your money.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is a GREAT place, small with a cool atmosphere. I loved the chicken curry press box, will be back for more SOON.

Heads up, they do take-out but some reason don't have a take-out menu... No idea why, management if you're reading this, post a take-out menu for hungry Yelpers like myself!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Seriously amazing flavors and options. Best restaurant in Santa Barbara/Montecito for sure. The place is small but the food it's just so incredible that makes this imperceptible. The Hanabi ""press box"" and the T&T ""roll"" OMG!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best sushi I have ever had. Habanero Yellowtail Melt is the best roll I have ever had. I feel like I have tried a lot of sushi in different places including Japan. But, nothing comes close to this place."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"This sushi joint is a favorite of my coworkers. We go less frequently than we'd both like, but it's one of the best (with Arigato) sushi places in Santa Barbara.

It's generally busy and they cram people in to the restaurant pretty tightly and it's closed on Monday. They also do not take reservations, so getting there early is best unless you want to wait a long time.

This is a sushi place that best suits people that like rolls. I can't say that I've been overly impressed with the single piece sushi or sashimi, though it is fairly fresh and pretty good. I'm not a fan of the way they do their sushi rice under the nigiri, though. It's a little wet for my taste.

They also tend to use a lot of sauce for decoration. You don't need the sauce for the fish to taste delicious, but some of it does add a new layer of taste. I tend to use it sparingly, although they put a lot on the plate.

The salmon mango roll is delicious. Other favorites include the marry-go-round roll, red wine unagi, and green dragon roll (eel and fried banana if you are in to that). The baked scallop roll is pretty good as well. Friends of ours like the habanero melt rolls (pretty spice, served warm).

I'd give the sushi between a three and four star rating. For Santa Barbara this is up there with the best in the area (seriously, it's surprising how limited the options are for great sushi in SB.). I still think Arigato is better."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I direct every out of town guest here. I plug the s*** out if this place. And I tell people to pass on Arigato because while the food is top notch, I can't bear the poser, wannabe rich young clientele often too scantily clad vs. the 50 and over actually wealthy Montecito crowd with nothing to prove. It's my favorite sushi in any city in America including NYC and LA. 

But I just made a rare scene. The hostess who works lunch is an obnoxious young blonde not nearly cute enough to cop the attitude she just did. 

I am a regular here. But she doesn't know this. Okay fine. 

I call at 1:35PM and ask if should order ahead as I am about 10 min away. I could have ordered to go. 

I get here and this unctuous chick says it's last call at 1:40.  I walked in at 1:52. Later than I thought but still 8 minutes before 2PM, closing time. 

If the place closes at 1:45, so be it. She is aggressive and unimpressive as an antagonist or opponent, plus absolutely not amenable to compromise or negotiation. Later she claims a soft touch would have worked. 

Uh, no. 

I am an intuitive reader of texts, human and otherwise. I am PhD candidate in English who studied and underwent psychoanalysis. She was most certainly not amenable to compromise. No desire to accommodate in this broad.  

I make a big enough fuss as someone who talks this place up regularly to get my roll to go. 

If last call is 20 MINUTES before closing, then for God's sake, SAY SO on website or Yelp or make a damned sign for the window. There has to be a competent artist at SBCC or UCSB they can bribe with fine free sushi. 

I am 42. She is likely 28-30. I tolerate this nonsense better from old people than a little pisher (Baby Boom Diane Keaton/James Spader reference: ""If it weren't for me, you'd be selling shoes at Barneys, you little pisher (sp))."" 

Grrr. 

The guy agreed to get me a roll to go. Not sure if server or busboy but clearly better suited to customer service than Blondie.  

Then when I note that closing time means you can walk in 10 min from closing and sit down for lunch at any restaurant I have been on either coast, she goes to, ""Do you live here?""

HA! 18 g****** years ago I started grad school at UCSB, sweetheart, when you were studying for the PSAT if that.  I served a dozen miserable years in this town as a full-time resident. So yeah, I'm ""from here"" in the relevant sense; I was a TA 17 years ago. The gall! 

Then she says, ""Well, it's Santa Barbara."" Oh! The tone! The smile! 

My biggest pet peeve is SB's conviction that it is the best city in the world. First of all, it's not a city. Second, SB is not better than LA. It's beautiful and has its virtues but I couldn't be here 18 years after moving for school more than 6-7 months a year. 

As the hostess uttered, ""It's Santa Barbara,"" it's not an apology. It's an arrogant battle cry! The condescension utterly unwarranted was enough to make me all but explode! 

Whatever. I come at night and don't have any regrets about the run-in. She was a snotty little blonde and that just doesn't fly with me

P.S. I would have spent 35 or so on lunch today at least. I am celebrating a 4 hour car trunk clean out and total organization of all my stuff I cart around from city to city. 
This was to have been a chill celebratory lunch. Total buzzkill but I derive pleasure from going all John Dryden (1693 Discourse on the Progress of Satire) on those who deserve it. The 18th C satirists felt the height of wit was to remove the head from the body with the pen... I am quite sure this girl has no idea who Dryden is. A pity."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"not the absolute worst sushi experience of our lives, but pretty darn close.  picked this spot b/c of the great reviews.  I thought it was ""cool"" that they didn't have a menu online or a takeout menu (tho they offer takeout).  maybe that gave it a bit of ""charm"" or ""exclusivity"".  boy were we wrong!  first, the menu is ginormous - 7 pages legal size length.  a specials board that had 50+items.  We ordered prob enough sushi for 2 hungry adults who were excited for yummy sushi, an app size chix teriyaki and edamame for the kids.  That cost $160+!!  the sushi was horrible.  not fresh, not good.  and not just one type, or an individual piece.  it was all crap.  will not be returning and already told local family to skip it"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Excellent sushi! There were authentic Japanese sushi chefs! That's kinda rare these days. Everything we ordered was delish! The only negative is the size of the restaurant...very tiny!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Yum. Prompt and attentive service. Smooth and tasty fish 
What more do you want?
Waitress was cool with us and a child on a Saturday night"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Wow! I am really impressed with Sakana Sushi! The fish was so fresh!! The presentation was amazing!!! I have never had a roll with so many different flavors, colors, and sauces without it being overwhelming. I didn't even want to use soy sauce (it's that good) I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this place!! I will be definitely become a regular here!! Best sushi place in town!! You will not be disappointed! The box basil crab roll is definitely something you should start with ;)"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Delicious. Huge selection. Try the Parmesan Scallop Press Box. 

Date night ambiance. Slightly awkward sitting at a two-person table (pink rose included) with your bro. 

Good food, though! The red bean ice cream was bomb."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My wife and I just love this place. We try to go here every couple weeks to get our sushi fix. It's a small restaurant so there is usually at least a half hour wait unless you arrive right when they open. But, the food makes the wait worth it. I have tried several of their press boxes and have narrowed my usual choices to the Montecito and Habanero Yellowtail Melt. Absolutely, delicious!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I seriously cannot stress how incredible this place is. Jenna was our waitress and she was friendly, yet professional. Everything we had was fresh, delicious and impeccably plated. We had multiple dishes from the box sushi menu and loved them all. I will be back for sure."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Sushi sooo good!  Innovative and definitely out of the box from your standard sushi...unexpected sauces make every bite different and the blow torch to char the fish is a finishing touch.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Perfection. Sakana is, without the best Sushi in Southern California for under $400.00 per person. Urasawa in Beverly Hills holds a slight edge importing live fish in tanks, but that's pretty rare air. The original Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills is still fabulous, but it's a firm 2nd place. In Santa Barbara, forget it. There is no 2nd place. 

My favorites at Sakana. Tuna Tower, Basil Fluke, Live Santa Barbara Uni. 

It's just... perfection."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My wife and I had an early dinner here last Friday evening, just as they opened.  The sushi is outstanding, the fish is very fresh.  Yes, they do have a very diverse ""non-traditional"" sushi menu, but they do have the classic rolls also if you need them.  We had the yellowtail habanero melt, the T&T, the Black Widow and their ""protein"" roll.  All the fish was delicious and fresh, and the presentation was great.  Get there early, this place was already filling up when we left at 6:00 p.m..  Spent $80 for two including two beers.

Great sushi place unless you're a sushi purist/snob.  We would definitely go again."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Wow, best and most unique selection of sushi rolls I've ever had.  The fish was very fresh and the presentation was terrific.  Kind of a small restaurant but if you want something different...and very good try this place. Good for kids too."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Really good sushi and udon.  My only issue is that they didn't enough staff.  Otherwise, the sushi was tasty and our wait staff was friendly and helpful.  

The mushroom sushi was very yummy with a small dollop of truffle on top.  The crunchy tofu roll was also good.  The Kobe beef roll was divine.  

My husband had the Montecito, zazu, and crab/ caviar rolls.   He loved them all.  


My daughter had the chicken udon which was very tasty.  The noodles were great.    

We will definitely be returning."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Sick sick sick.... Should have known after going into their bathroom and being overwhelmed by the smell of fish, that we should have turned around and left. But instead we stayed and paid the price. The sushi rice was way undercooked, the ""crab"" was pulled from a plastic container, fish stacked on top of each other, same sauces for every dish and food poisoning to top it off. 
Never eating here again!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is without question one of the best sushi restaurants in Santa Barbara. Fish is always fresh, sauces are amazing, and the workers are ALWAYS so amazing. I have been coming here since I was probably 8 years old and I still go every time I'm in Santa Barbara!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"It was our last night in town, we wanted some good sushi. We asked the proprietor at our hotel where to go. He was not a sushi eater but his guests gave this place ""raving reviews"" So he gave me a typical California directions. ""Go out to Cabrillo [blvd] and go under the freeway to the turnabout then make the first right off the turnabout and follow the street parallel to the freeway until you see the Starbucks"" No street names, no name of the restaurant.
We arrive to this little gem tucked away in the far back corner. 
The staff was very friendly, a soothing marine animal video playing in the background. 
We were introduced to ""press boxes"". We'd never had one before. They were absolutely delicious. Fresh fish combined with fruits, herbs and wonderful sauces. We also had the Kobe Beef Carpaccio, mmmmmmmmm.
I had thought at first look on the menu that the place was a bit pricey, but the food quality matched the prices.
It was a perfect end to our weekend."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"We were looking for a good place for lunch in Santa Barbara on our way from SF to LA, and this was a lucky find. Being from SF, it's always a surprise to us to find nice places in suburban shopping centers. We had a lovely lunch, very good sushi, and very nice cold sake. Were disappointed that they were closed when we did the reverse trip on Easter."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"The food here is almost indescribable. Melt-in-your-mouth, two-bite sized, magic creations plated on lines of delicious and flavorful sauces.  

I guess it's sushi as in fish but there is no fishy taste (Yay!). We only show up here with friends that order for us so I'm sorry to say that I cannot even tell you what I eat here. 

Waitstaff is efficient and friendly - it is not a quiet romantic place where you decide you want a 2 hour dinner- they get you in and out quickly.

It's worth the wait like others have said - the key here is drive a van and have a few cocktails within while you wait:)"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I love this sushi bar!! However, it's good to call ahead because it's closed a lot. The hamachi melt is to die for!! The artistic designs and the Flavors of the sauces will make your mouth melt. This is the best sushi place in Santa Barbara!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I enjoyed every piece of the sushi and think it is a fine place to dine. However, since it is a small place, waiting for a table can drag for a long time. I suggest visiting off peak hours"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Let me begin by saying I was introduced to this sushi restaurant by my old roommate who works there, who ranted and raved about the sushi at Sakana. I figured it would be okay, BUT WHO KNEW?!!!?

I consider myself a sushi connoisseur and honestly have never encountered such innovative and delicious sushi combinations!
The menu is filled with vast amounts of different types of fish combined with their unique twist on traditional sushi. The custom sauces (which were created by the restaurant owner and chef) add to each amazing bite you take.

Definitely recommend any of the press box rolls, the Merry-go-round, the Red Dragon, Half & Half, and I'm not sure what its called but its spicy and has mango and is absolutely superb.

The staff is super friendly, always attentive, and i LOVE marcos.

Theres usually a wait so try and beat the dinner rush and get there pretty early. The bar seats are the best. The chefs are a kick.

This is one place you won't be disappointed by."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This place is very unique and creative when it comes to the menu.  They also have super fresh fish and simple nigiri so traditionalists can get their fix too.  Overall our meal started out super strong with the garlic albacore nigiri (SOOO Garlicky! Amazing!)  and some rich spicy rolls.  We also got some seared salmon nigiri that was delicious with orange vinaigrette and caviar.  We then ordered 2 press boxes, which I was not really a fan of. (if you don't know what that is, it's like a roll with no seaweed).  The texture was just all mushed together and I really did miss the nori.  Next time I would just stick to rolls and Nigiri.  The only criticism I really have is that the rolls come with too much sauce.  There's like 5 kinds of rich sauces on each plate and they overwhelm the flavor of the fish, especially the curry (although my sis liked it).  I think they should just simplify a little bit and it would be amazing!
The only disappointment of the night was the dessert--fried bananas were a little hard, small portion and over all not super tasty :(
Dad's fried ice cream was much better though!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Eating at Sakana is an unforgettable treat!  I lived all over Japan for 20+ years in places boasting some of the best sushi like Hokkaido, Kyushu and Osaka so I do know my sushi.
Trust me when I say it's among the best in the world.  Sakana takes sushi to new dimensions with its creative approach and amazing sauces and presentation.  Purists can order sans sauce for a more traditional taste.  I was impressed as well with the sake menu which has a well-considered selection of sakes.  I like that the ambiance is not pretentious despite the excellence of the food.  This place is one of my all-time favorites."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"EASILY the best sushi in Santa Barbara. Sakana has a very creative and robust menu filled with flavorful items. The staff is almost comically (in a positive way) helpful. You absolutely must try the Basil Fluke! Waze did not know the way to restaurant, but it got us close and we were able to wing it from there. The space is pretty small and it was a little loud but it added to the vibe and energy of the place. Prices are on the high-side but the quality drives the value. Only ""want"" is for them to have some Ramune for the kiddo (and maybe,me)."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Excellent sushi! Fresh and beautiful presentation. The habanero sushi was delicious. I think this is my favorite sushi place in the area!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This place was AMAZING! My wife and I visited on our way down south to celebrate our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the fine cuisine. I say surprised, because at first sight it seemed like a regular place kind of in a strip mall of sorts and the actual restaurant was very tiny. My kitchen/family room is bigger than the dining area of this place, however we were seated right away, and from what I understand the wait can be a while due to the small space. Once we were seated we were attended to right away and our server made some great recommendations, we had the montecito press box and the habanero yellowtail, along with some teriyaki chicken. We were curious as to what a press box was since we are used to traditional sushi rolls and the server explained that they were rolls simply not wrapped in seaweed. Once we tried the rolls to say we were pleased is an understatement! They were absolutely delicious! The texture, and rich, full, taste of both rolls were simply divine. The rolls were also a generous size so my wife and I left satisfied, and will definitely be back again. Service was excellent, and they are deserving of th ehighest recommendation."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I ate here many months ago and my mind still goes back to think of the refreshing taste of that wonderful sashimi. 

The night after eating there I dreamt they knit me a sweater vest out of sashimi. I devoured it in front of their eyes. They kicked me out on account of the no shirt no shoes policy...but it was worth it.  Best dream of the year."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Upon the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel in Montecito, we chose to dine at Sakana. Simply put, both my husband and I feel that this was hands down, the best sushi we have ever had. If I lived close, I would be here everyday. 

We walked in on a Saturday night and and were seated in about 10 minutes. The only gripe was that we got in at about 9pm, and last call was at 9:50pm, thankfully our waitress notified us of the last call. Next time, I will be sure to get in earlier to be able to linger over the menu more. 

The menu is pages of glorious specialty rolls, press boxes along with sushi/ sashimi creations. I just about fell out of my chair when the habanero yellowtail press box roll entered my mouth. Seriously, I laughed it was so amazing. Also wonderful was the Light and Healthy (no rice, cucumber rolled around spicy tuna, asparagus, gobo, crab and shrimp) roll. The Black Widow was delish as well, although my husband is more of the eel person than I am, but still was yummy. Don't miss the seared salmon Hawaiian roll (I forget the name exactly of the roll)- it has mango salsa topping and is a superb mix of flavors. 

We also got salmon, ahi, yellowtail and seared salmon and yellowtail sushi. Generous portions of fish and extremely fresh! The salmon was garnished to perfection with a microthin slice of lemon- incredible!

I cannot wait until we are back in Montecito, eating our hearts out at Sakana."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Tonight was our first time at Sakana and we loved it.  We have been to many other Sushi bars and we have our favorite but this place is as good as it gets.  The fish is fresh and melts in your mouth. The Basil Fluke(Halibut) is to die for. We tried two different specialty rolls and both were good.  We will absolutely go back. Just a note, we got there early and it looks like there is a wait after 6 PM so go early or be prepared to wait a bit, but well worth it."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"If I could give this place a 10 out of 5 I would. It's everything I've been looking for since moving to Santa Barbara 8 months ago. It's so tasty. The fish is fresh, the sauces unique and flavorful, presentation is beautiful, the restaurant has great decor and a great feel, and the staff is welcoming and nice. the Kobe beef sashimi is amazing...the mango habanero yellowtail melt sashimi is so also a favorite...I've also had the basil press box, Kobe beef press box and the toro press box. The basil one was my favorite, I'd just add a Kobe beef sushi to it ;). I would eat here every meal of every day. So good.
Been here about 10 times more since then and still, always an amazing experience."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Yes, yes... Arigato this and Arigato that.  But for those who like to enjoy sushi at lunch, Sakana is hands-down the best place to go in the SB area.  Try the Habanero Yellowtail Box Roll, or if you're on a budget, get one of the great sushi lunch specials ($11.99 - $14.99 and you can get relatively full).  Also great for dinner, but the crowds pick up.  I'm debating if Arigato or Sakana is the best, but you really can't miss with either."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"There are SO many places in this town to get sushi.    Some of it is good, some of it is really good and this place is great, no, it is heaven!   Compared to the others the sushi is so, so, so good!   I would even say that it is the best sushi I have ever eaten.   

I have been to Sakana three times and each time was better than the last.    I think that maybe it is the one restaurant in Santa Barbara that will never let me down."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to, and I have been to a lot. It is by far the best in Santa Barbara. Arigato pales in comparison. When trying Sakana for the first time, you have to get a few press boxes. It is their specialty and what sets them apart. If you just get the traditional rolls you will not be experiencing the magic of Sakana."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Me and the honey were visiting some friends in SB...our old stomping grounds and all they could talk about was Sakana sushi this and Sakana sushi that...well being that I live in SF now the town of great fucking sushi I was a bit skeptical...Well child let me tell you I am a believer...

I loved what the chef at Sakana did with the sauces and his take on contemporary sushi was aaaaamaaaaaaaazzzzinnnnnnnnnng!! We were a bit adventurous and ordered quite a bit of good stuff...I cannot remember any of the names but trust me you cannot go wrong. It was a total foodgasm!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My favorite sushi restaurant in Santa Barbara, and one of my all-time favs. Incredibly fresh and delicious. Small place, so expect to wait, but it's worth it."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana has continued to beat out every sushi restaurant I have been to in Santa Barbara. It is somewhat pricey, but worth it. The Habanero Yellowtail pressed box is delicious and filling while the Hawaiian roll is extremely refreshing with mango on top of the roll. The garlic edamame is a must have as a starter. I will definitely continue to make routine trips to Sakana!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"The food was so fresh and delicious. And our waitress Jackie was excellent, so friendly, personable and helpful."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is quite possibly the most impressive sushi bar / restaurant in Southern California. The overall quality of the food served here is far superior to any other sushi restaurant in the near vicinity. Not only is the fish always very fresh and tasty, but the attention to detail of the chefs is incredible. Each plate comes to as a work of art. Only downside is they do not take reservations? And wait times can often exceed 30 mins to be seated on busy nights."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My boyfriend and I came here during Memorial Weekend. It was so good on Saturday night that we knew we had to come again Sunday evening for dinner.

Living in San Francisco, we have Japantown and numerous sushi places with incredible flavors. But Sakana has forever changed my palate. No sushi bar will ever surpass Sakana. I highly recommend to anyone who is in the area of Santa Barbara. Their fish is so fresh it melts in your mouth. You do not even need to use soy sauce. Incredible! But it doesn't stop there, the presentation is out of this world. The way they dress up their sushi was beautiful. See attached images. If I'm in the area, I will definitely be back."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I would label Sakana as an alternative sushi restaurant  with the majority being fusion dishes with just enough traditional items to make it seem right. I loved every bite. The Kobe Carpaccio was amazing, great flavor. The press boxes were interesting and delicious and the freshness of their sushi is spectacular."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Coming from Boston, I was expecting something at least a little different.  I got it here, in that this was both the worst and most expensive sushi I have ever had.  The rolls were incredibly sloppy,  all uneven sizes and with pieces hanging out all over the plate.  We had to use our fingers to eat, because otherwise we had rice in our laps. I impressed everyone at the table by eating a large spoonful of wasabi-only, it literally had no taste.  Without exaggerating, I can honestly say that all any of us could taste was flour.  It came in a squiggle on the plate that made it obvious that they used cosco tubed wasabi.  This is akin to serving canola oil with bread at a good Italian restaurant.  The fact that there was half the food left on the table when we were finished should be a good indication of the quality.  This place blew it for me."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My mother in law has been talking this place up for years and I finally got the opportunity to give it shot. Talk about living up to the hype!! Wow! So many amazing combinations- basil crab, habanero crab and truffle. The Pokemon, and Lite and Healthy rolls were awesome. My kids loved everything but the popcorn shrimp was a great bridge to the better stuff (parents will know what I mean by that) Even the nigiri was memorable- the fish was so fresh and flavorful.
Definitely worth the wait!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Well visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend. We decided to try out this sushi spot on our last night there. The ratings on yelp were high, and considering that it wasn't located on State Street was definitely a good sign. When we arrive we noticed it was located in a small shopping center way in the corner. The place was packed and we did wait 30 mins to get a table, but we didn't mind. The atmosphere was great and our waitress was sweet, but the food was phenomenal. The miso soup was flavorful and the garlic edamame w/ soy sauce was amazing. I tried the rainbow and mango roll and both were fresh and delicious. I washed it all down with A nigori sake that our waitress recommended, it was a very satisfying night."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Perfect sushi and service every time. Favorites are red dragon roll, crunchy box, habanero yellowtail roll.

Delicious."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is hands down the best sushi I have ever eaten. I dream of it at night. 

Their press boxes are a small piece of heaven in your mouth. Just go, you can thank me later. 

My only negative comment is that it's very small and if you don't get there early you'll be in for a long wait. But it's worth it."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Best sushi I have ever had!  The staff is amazing and the food is fabulous. Highly recommend the seared yellowtail press box roll.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I was not particularly impressed by this sushi. We tried a variety of things so we could get a good handle of what they serve here. 2 pressed sushi, Sakana roll, Lobster Melt, single order sushi, etc. A little over 100 worth of sushi. 

Overall presentation of sushi is good. It is very pretty to look at. However, I would say that they hide the taste of the fish under so many flavors, sauces, and such. Their signature roll, named after the place, did not taste high quality. It tastes like a fish stick was rolled into the roll. I would have preferred to just taste the fish on everything we ordered, not the sauces. 

The ambiance is very classy, the tables are very close together as in many sushi places."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Amazing. I lived in Santa Barbara for six years and ate at literally every sushi joint this small town had to offer. This is the place to go if you're looking for traditional rolls and fresh fish. The chef has created several innovative rolls as well (known as the press box roll.) The restaurant is tiny and often when it's busy, there's a long wait for food--but I never minded waiting forty-five minutes for my food to come, seeing that it is the best sushi restaurant in this area."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"The habanero yellowtail melt and surfers sushi are delicious!  So far, this is the best sushi I have had.  The dishes are presented with care and the tastes are amazing.  Also, our server Ashley was awesome!  Definitely go here if you are looking for sushi in Santa Barbara.  I have tried the other places and they are good...but they are no Sakana :)"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,High quality sushi! Their sashimi is especially excellent. The basil truffle melts in your mouth. Also loved the jalapeño sashimi! Fresh and delicious!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Great service, fresh fish, amazing sushi and atmosphere!  Press boxes are great, they come with lots of different flavored sauces.  It's tucked away in a small strip mall and don't have many tables so make sure you get there early!

Favorites include:
Habanero yellowtail melt press box
Red wine & mozzarella eel melt press box
Crunchy box
Surfers
You will not be disappointed by any of these!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Excellent selection. Almost too many choices. Loved the tempura habanero lobster roll and the T&T was my date's highlight.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Awesome sushi, super creative and tasty. 
However, the waitress we had was extremely unfriiendly, and when we found a hair in one of our rolls and told her about it, she said nothing, took the plate away, and asked us what else we would like to order -- no acknowledgement whatsoever!?!?
We will try this place again because the food was so good, hoping for a better waitstaff experience next time."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,They do not disappoint!  Everything we have tried has been excellence.  Top quality sushi in small place - quaint and casual.  On the pricey side of a neighborhood joint but SO fresh and tasty.  Kobe beef melts in mouth.  Recommend their omakase.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,It melts in your mouth it's so fresh. I love the concept and the service is more than amazing. Pricey but well worth it.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This was recommended to us by someone and boy was it spot on. This place has AWESOME sushi. We sat at the bar and talked and watched the sushi chefs work. The sushi was nothing short of amazing. We had the Kobe Beef press box, the garlic albacore. The salmon sashimi was like butter - melt in your mouth. I can't recommend this place enough if you are in the area."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Absolutely some of the best sushi I have ever had! Chef Nau has created some of the most innovative rolls and incredible sauces to compliment them. The fish is always extremely fresh. I suggest getting any of the press boxes. The Habanero Yellowtail Melt is one of my favorites. Of the Kawari sushi, I highly suggest the Basil Fluke. It is incredible. All of the sushi chefs are well trained and give amazing service. The servers and the busboys have the best most friendly attitude. 
Definitely a gem for Santa Barbara and Montecito."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Delicious small sushi joint tucked away in Montecito.  The fish is always fresh and the selection of rolls is not only vast but creative.  There are at least 3 full pages of rolls to choose from.  It can be overwhelming, but it is a guarantee you'll find something you like whether you want something simple and bite-sized or something extravagant and fist-sized.   Great presentation, service, sake selection, ambiance (although small), etc."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"5/5 for the food. 
3/5 for the staff.
Still the best place to go if you want good sushi..."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,The best Sushi I have ever had. I live in the Bay Area and literally come here everytime I visit SB.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"First of all,  if you are looking for traditional sushi - do not go here.  Go here for a spectacularly unique sushi experience!  Had 7 different things from menu and loved them all! Favorite sushi restaurant! ENJOY!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I'd put this sushi restaurant against the best sushi places in the country.  The owner Nao is also the head chef.  Sakana prefers quality over quantity but even so, this place is cheap compared to LA or NYC sushi restaurants.

I hate to even recommend this place - it's already getting too hard to get in."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Great little Sushi joint, very local crowd.

Excellent fish.

Would definitely come back"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,WOW!!!!  We went here on a no carb day!  Their amazing selection of sashimi was out of this world.  There was a bit of a wait but they were able to seat everyone very quickly.  And the food was out of this world.  Hands down will visit again when I'm in the area.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is the best sushi in Santa Barbara, hands down! It is the perfect place for the sushi connoisseur. The fish is always fresh and the rice is perfection. This place is best known for their sauces. They have homemade soy sauce and amazing habanero garlic, jalapeño cilantro, and a plum sweet sauce. The ambiance has a more traditional Japanese feel with a touch of romance as there are always roses on the tables. 

The best place to sit in my opinion is the bar because you get the chance to talk to your chef. Taidu is one of the sushi chef's there and always creates a beautiful plate for me. Most times I will do a chefs choice order where Taidu makes what he wants and typically they are off the menu. It blows my tastebuds every time! To start you have to have the King Salmon nigiri and the Tuna Toro nigiri, its worth the money you will not regret it. To end the meal, my favorites are definitely the jalapeño cilantro sashimi plate and any of the press boxes."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I would very much consider Sakana a gourmet sushi restaurant regardless of it's size. It's got amazing sushi, the best rolls, great raw fish, and a great atmosphere.

Best place for dates. 

Get the Habenero Lobster melt. It's worth every penny."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"We went while vacationing from LA, and loved it!! The service was great, and the sushi was even better. Really creative flavors, and the most beautiful presentation I have seen. Definitely recommend!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Another tiny sushi place in a random shopping center. Luckily, we got here early and we were seated right away. It got packed soon after. The place is unique, and even though there are some usual favorites on the menu there are many that are unique to this restaurant (or at least I have never seen before). I don't know what kind of rice they use (I think brown rice), but it is not the typical sushi rice. Usually that would spell disaster for any sushi, however after eating here I decided whatever they use works. Their menu is quite overwhelming with so many options, and typically I know what sushi I like so I lean towards my trusty favorites. However, this time my mom wanted to try different rolls, and so the task began to read each description. The waitress was helpful, and let us know what fish was really good that day and what was popular. I had the toro, which was fatty and perfect. We also tried the Montecito roll, which I liked but would probably try something different when I come here again. We had 2 other rolls, but unfortunately their names escape me. Their presentation is great, and they use different sauces to make designs on the plate. I hope that doesn't take too long because I rather have my sushi out faster, than those pretty designs =). The waitress was very nice and tried to be attentive, but seemed a bit overwhelmed once the place got busier. I would go here again to try more rolls and the sashimi, but I would come early to avoid the crowd."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"We had a great evening, food was wonderful. We were enjoying ourselves up until the last minute. We ordered a good amount of food for two people. After sitting down for an hour we we're asked to leave because they were too busy. We we're shocked by the terrible service which otherwise would have been a lovely experience. Will definitely not be returning!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is my favorite restaurant in the entire world. I love the press boxes. I used to do a mix of press boxes and rolls, but then I realized how amazing the press boxes are. The best is the jabanero yellowtail melt. I also love the tie dye.

Warning: this place might ruin sushi anywhere else for you"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Friendliest staff and mouth watering food! When the toes melts in your mouth, you know it's worth it. I honestly have no words that can do this place justice. Absolutely phenomenal!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My friend recommended I try Sakana and I'm glad that I did. I try to go to as many different sushi places that I can in all the cities that I travel to. I was a little skeptical since there weren't that many sushi places in Santa Barbara, but Sakana did not disappoint. If you are looking for a variety of rolls, they definitely have them, however, I only tried one of them - the Black Widow (a roll with soft shell crab and eel on top). This was actually really good as the soft shell crab (spider roll) is one of the few rolls that I ever order. 

The highlight of the meal was definitely the live fresh uni. It is locally farmed in Santa Barbara and definitely lives up to the quality and freshness. I've had live uni only at a few sushi places, especially since most places dont have it. I would go back to Sakana to have the live uni, but be aware, they don't always have it. Other highlights from our meal at the sushi bar included salmon belly, yellowtail belly. mackeral, snapper, scallop, baby yellowtail, live sweet shrimp, blue fin tuna, and white salmon.

If you are looking to get some fresh sushi in the Santa Barbara area, I would definitely recommend Sakana. Sit at the sushi bar and befriend the sushi chef as I asked for anything fresh that they had. He let me try a few extra things that he created which were definitely pleasing to the palate."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Pretty amazing sushi, sauce heavy but very creative and delicious.  It's a very small place and the wait is at least 45 minutes but have some saki while you wait, and you won't even notice.  it's worth the wait - seems to be a local hang out.  The hostess was so friendly and did a great job handling some people complaining about the long wait and invading her already small space."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,By far one of the best sushi restaurants! Specialty sushi's are soooooo delicious. Can't wait to come again!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Nestled into the end of a strip mall in Montecito, Sakana is a true hidden gem of the locals scene in Santa Barbara. Pulling up to this unassuming and intimate restaurant right next to a Vons, you'll find a dim-lit and charming interior boasting incredibly creative sushi with picture-perfect presentations. 

Like Nicolette Sheridan, this is what we call a sure thing.

First, the menu is huge. If you're a strict traditionalist then you'll be disappointed since their spin on sushi is quite novel; combining fish, textures and flavors in ways I had never before seen. We ordered the Surfer's roll...twice...maybe three times because every time it hit the table everyone began using their chopsticks as weapons of war. We went on to devour the Red Dragon and Montecito rolls with impatient precision. The ahi tuna appetizer is also worth noting. The sushi is served in press box form so you won't find any seaweed holding things together or impacting the overall taste. Every dish is positioned like artwork with splashes of colorful sauces striped across and as you eat and dip the image on the plate transforms. 

It's not cheap but it's also completely worth the price tag. Plus, they are cool with BYOB so our feast for four ended at under $40 each. For a bonus, see if you can convince your dining companion that the HD fish screen is actually a live feed of the tank in the back kitchen. The fish is fresh enough for it to be convincing..."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"First of all, I hate sushi. I'm not a fan of anything raw. The sushi at this place is made with the heavenly gift of blessing every grain of rice, every ounce of sea food, seaweed wrap, like it was made by the heavens themselves. This place is a must if you're in the area. Hell, This place was a must while I was living in San Diego.  

YOU MUST TRY Habanero Lobster melt.  And no it's not that spicy."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is the only sushi spot I have tried in and around Santa Barbara. I was visiting from LA and found this gem on Yelp! Best .  Sushi. Ever. We were seated promptly without a reservation. Staff was very attentive and friendly. 

The menu is big and a bit overwhelming but everything we ordered was scrumptious.  I laughed when I first saw the presentation of the seaweed salad, which came in a tall martini glass. I thought it looked stupid but it turned out to be very practical. It saved a lot of room on the small table for the sushi plates. Well thought out. Kudos!

I wish this place existed in LA. I will be back whenever I am in town!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Simply amazing!

Sakana is by far some of the best sushi I've ever had.  It's definitely pricey, but totally worth every penny.  This is not really the place to go if you're looking for traditional sushi, but in no way should you let that deter you.  I find that I'm blown away each time I eat here.  Everything is so full of flavorful, and the fish is so fresh.  They use a lot of sauces and flavorings, so you really don't need to add any soy sauce to most things.  I would call the style a bit fusion - Japanese presentation with ingredients from other regions (like truffle oil, basil, etc.)  I really enjoy the magic box roll with salmon.  There is also a yellowtail nigiri style sushi with a truffle oil sauce on it, which I'm not sure of the name of, but is also really good.  

The down side is that it is very small, so squeezing to your table can be difficult and there is usually a wait.  I'm not sure that they take reservations either.  For a couple, I'd recommend sitting at the sushi bar.  Then you get dinner and a show!  Watching the chef's create their works of art is a lot of fun."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Holy shit this sushi is good!!! It's the best sushi I have ever had...ever! Great ambiance and great staff. I think the only thing that sucked was the fact that we had to wait about 40 mins for a table. But the sushi was so good that I am not going to take a star away for that. 

bottom line: go here and you will not be disappointed."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"BOYCOTT BLUEFIN TUNA. Dont get me wrong, I love this restaurant. Especially when I'm in the mood for something a little creative. Sadly, I've vowed to boycott any restaurant that sells bluefin tuna, and the last time we were there they had it on the specials menu. I'll be back when they vow to stop selling bluefin. I'm surprised how far behind sushi restaurants are with sustainable seafood practices."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is a favorite of mine and the hubby. Great ambiance - very cozy and warm. The rolls are eclectic and original...and delish! I highly recommend the following rolls: lobster habanero melt, bakes scallop, green snake, crunchy veggie, and the kobe beef sushi."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Though the cuts of sashimi were large, the price was a little more than I would usually pay. The fell is totally Santa Barbra. Because I didn't do any of their specially rolls, I can't really comment on the sushi. But the fish is fresh!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,The presentation was amazing.  Fish was perfect.  The owners were also so nice as well.  We will go back soon.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Sakana has the reputation of being the best sushi restaurant in the Santa Barbara area. I have gone to many other sushi places in the area and I was totally dissapointed and almost angry after having lunch there last week. Sushi was average, with below average serving sizes and WAY outrageous prices. The place does not deserve it's reputation!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Hidden gem. Wonderful selection of sushi with a twist e.g. Green tea smoked scallop sushi. Reservations recommended.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best sushi I've ever had, and I am a sushi snob!  My cuz used to work here and brought me there for my birthday.  I truly have to say it's a treasure!  I might have already yelped this.. but I have to again because it's so good... Small place though.  Oprah goes here too... Shhh don't tell anyone about this place though.. I want to keep it all for myself.. YUM"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,This meal was completely perfect. The restaurant itself is clean and well decorated. The menu was vast so take your time in deciding what to eat. They have a wide range of rolls from traditional to specialty rolls as well as a unique box rolls. They also have other options for vegetarians as well as those who are unsure about sushi. The service was great and the food was delicious. Some of the best sushi I have ever had and I would highly recommend this spot to any fellow sushi lovers! Enjoy!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"No question this place has some incredible rolls and sashimi.  Definitely the place you go for the creative and unorthodox (not for the same-old-same-old sushi).  

there are 200 items on the menu and I've only had the pleasure of 10 of them.  but as I return, I will expand this review (for now, anything with habanero sauce is to die for and the baked green lip mussels are killer...but be careful, they come in groups  of five so I hope you know how to share ""awesomeness"").

god bless my girlfriend for introducing me to this place.  can't wait to go back for the oysters (which, fyi, can run out if you get there too late!)"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Flat out the best sushi I've ever had! Unique, delicious flavors. It is pricey but worth it. Great sake selection too!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My partner and I got here just in time! Right after we sat down, the place was mobbed.

The sushi is fresh and prepared well, and the restaurant has an extensive list of fishes they serve. Quite impressive--and tasty!

I would stick with the nigiri and skip the creative rolls and plates, though."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I don't know who is writing these reviews but my guess would be uncultured locals. The girl at the front desk should have gotten her money back from charm school. We seemed to have totally ruined her day by asking for a table for two. She proceeded to keep us waiting and basically ignored us even though the place half full. The floor of this restaurant was filthy, and as for the toilets, let's not go there. Leaves a lot to be desired in terms of rude staff and sushi chefs who all seem miserable. If your looking for a relaxed and enjoyable dining experience go anywhere but here!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Oh my goodness!! This is some of the best sushi I have ever had. My husband and I were on vacation when this restaurant was recommended to us. I am so glad we tried it it was amazing. We had 3 rolls, 2 orders of sushi, an appetizer and a few beers all for under $100 bucks, you can't beat that. Try it!!!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My husband and I came here for our first date as a married couple, and we were not disappointed. Their prices are as a typical sushi place is, but their ambiance is outstanding, staff are attentive, and their food is incredible. The low lighting with blue and pink uplighting make set the perfect mood for a date. Their miso was incredible, the sushi and sashimi were killer. We ordered so much food it was ridiculous, but we still managed to eat it all =)
The only criticism that I have is that our wait time was estimated to be 20-25 minutes, and we ended up waiting 35-40. Not really a big deal though, and it was a Saturday night, so not bad for that being my only criticism."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My fried couldn't stop talking of how good Sakana Sushi is. 
i had to try it for myself. 
He was not wrong, a very modern sushi bar with great presentation. 
It one of the only sushi bars with a page of sashimi rolls. Very different, and great for somebody who doesn't like rice (my wife). 
There lobster and habanero roll is amazing. 
We order 8-10 different rolls and we were not disappointed with any of them. Each roll was served it look like a piece of art. 
A true star 
Will be back soon."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"very normal, sashimi is not good. the specialities are just normal. price is not worth it you will never find any japanese eating there I bet you.
food looks nice though but as taste point just normal needs to improve quality of where they grt the fish from."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My absolute favorite sushi place in the Santa Barbara area. It's easy to spend a lot of money here but it is absolutely worth it. The combination of flavors is heavenly and each plate is a work of art. A few of my favorites are Aburi Scallop Sushi, Basil Fluke Sushi, Habanero Yellowtail Melt, and the Merry-Go-Round roll. The press boxes are great too. Haven't had anything I didn't love here. Fresh fish, unique flavors, and great service."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Got some sushi takeaway last nice and it was the best thing in the world! Such good avocado rolls.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"A complete U Turn! They seemed to have gotten in a new hostess and servers, which are all very courteous and polite. This makes for a much better experience and I'm happy to say the food is even better also. Try the Champagne Lobster with Fresh Crab & Caviar, and they also do the best Uni Shooter I've ever had!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"No idea how this place is getting the good ratings it is. I knew it was going to be high priced sushi but I assumed then it would be good quality from all the reviews. We were wrong. 50 dollars for 2 rolls and edamame was so not worth it. My husbands roll was decent. He said it was worth more like 10 bucks though and it was generic. It also was not held together and the first piece completely feel apart when he tried to pick it up. Mine on the other hand came so sloppy, had a ridiculous amount of cream cheese in it and the avocado was all brown. I had to scrap some off because it tasted rotten. The tempura shrimp on the inside was rubbery, cold and tasted very old and fishy. I only had a couple pieces. My husband (who eats all my left overs) tried a piece but then said he didn't  want anymore cuz it tasted so gross and not fresh. We got a side of sauce with our Edamame that had too much of an over powering fishy aftertaste so we couldn't  eat it. And the 6 dollar edamame was extremely small for the price. Save your money and go get good sushi cheaper somewhere else."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Excellent place. Delicious food. Innovative sushi. Nice specials. Would definitely come back. Good time for all. Try the shrimp heads!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Possibly the most creative sushi ever!  Favorites include the habanero yellowtail melt and the sea bass appetizer is the best.  The uni was so fresh that it was actually moving (great texture and taste).  I would agree that the service although not bad was not friendly or personable.  The hostess and waitresses were more engaged with each other and seemed to congregate at the end of the sushi bar hence the 4 star rating, however I observed that the busboy was excellent attending to all of the tables and made sure that the turnovers were seamless.  Definitely a fan of Sakana!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best sushi I have had in a while.  Rainbow roll was large and super fresh. Try the Shrimp Popcorn as well, shrimp so fresh with not a hint of fish smell. It's all pricy, but worth it."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"It's not that I didn't love my meal here, it's just... the service was not what I had in mind. 

customers remember the little things, right?"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Hands down, best sushi I've ever had.  Sakana has definitely set the bar.  Their coconut curry mango shrimp roll is TO DIE FOR. Great place for dates, I don't believe they take reservations though.  I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes, trust me its worth it.  Very small, intimate, low light atmosphere. Staff is great, everything on the menu is pretty much heavenly.  You can't really go wrong here."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Very good fish, decent service, celebrity sighting, Sakana has a casual feel to it. 
Delicious fish, tonite I enjoyed sashimi - Ono, Mirugai, Tako, Ika, Toro & Sake. Also had the Blackened Yellowtail Press Box, beautiful presentation & taste. The California rolls & Yellowtail sushi were very good as well.
This is a busy & smallish restaurant so bring your patience."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Silly good. Not necessarily traditional sushi. The sauces are made in house and always an awesome supplement to the variety of rolls/press boxes/other dishes. Stop by every time I'm in town.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Officially obsessed. Why did I never come here when I actually lived in Montecito? I will be kicking myself for years on that one. Well, luckily it's a short drive or bike ride from downtown SB.

Go there and be transported to another world. The lighting and ambiance made me feel like I was back in NYC or another hip locale. Everything is delicious. If you are lucky to have Rachel as your server, her recommendations are top notch. My current favorites are the Black Widow and Habanero Yellowtail Melt.

For small parties, seating is rather quick. For 4 or more, expect to wait 20-30 min.

Enjoy!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This was a fun one-time experience! I don't have the budget to eat here. My date and I dropped $80 on 3 rolls and one bowl of udon. The sushi was fantastic, though. We ordered the Sakana roll for the obvious reason and to try something new--YUM. I didn't want to share it!

Usually we go to Edomasa on De la Vina. We get 2 rolls and two soups there for $30 to $40."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"sushi enthusiast be aware, this is not your traditional sushi. if simple is what you want, don't the the door hit you on the way out. 
if you're in the mood for flavors you never thought possible and rolls that will blow your mind, then put your name on the list and wait your turn.
every single roll we ordered had the most amazing presentation and tasted better than any raw fish i've ever had.
really friendly staff, not a pretentious vibe. i liked the flat screen streaming deep sea jellyfish. i won't lie, i also like the hot sushi chef.
sakana is modern sushi done better than ever. i used to hit up another spot when in sb, but now sakana's got my vote."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Had lunch here with my mother on 1.6.16 I'm a local and had read the great Yelp reviews. We took a seat at the bar. No server.  Tracked down a server, waited forever for waters forever to take our order. I finally asked our server why three other tables came in, got waited on and served. She was speechless, then said that they are regulars. So the lesson is, if you're not a regular, don't expect service or explanations. I was so turned off at the snobbiness that I couldn't enjoy the food. The server never made an attempt to make us happy. She gladly accepted our $55. Never again."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best sushi in SB. Most sushi up here is not that great! The selection and cut of fish offered is way below average. 
Not Sakana. 
Really good selection and great specialty rolls. The sushi chefs are great too! Funny and really good at playing and making the order fun. 
By far the best sushi in town!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is by far the best sushi place I have ever been to in my entire lifespan and I have have dozens and dozens of sushi places in my lifetime, but this place leaves ever single one in the dust. Literally every specialty roll is nothing short of mesmerizing!! The staff is always super friendly too. I so wish there was a location in the Valley but I will find any excuse to come out to Santa Barbra just so I can come to Sakana absolutely amazing"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I LOVE Sakana, esp the beautifully and artfully embellished plates.  What a bummer last night to get the mango/lobster roll (sounds good right?) and receive a huge (too big for biting) deep fried, heavily battered sliced thing... not gently torched but deep fried in heavy batter! yuck.  the press boxes much better, and popcorn shrimp perfectly cooked and succulent."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,I'm sorry. On our way up the coast from LA and we stopped because of all the great Yelp reviews.... After 4 sushi rolls and a salmon sashimi I have to say giving this 1 was really being nice. It lacks freshness and authenticity and their need to add things like beets and PESTO sauce to the plate really make it a mess. I'd say if your expecting an AMAZING or even a fair sushi experience this really isn't the place. I really wish I had something GOOD to say.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I typically go for a more traditional sushi experience. I do like it when fish is paired with other amazing flavors, like truffled soy or garlic, but I like to be able to taste the fish. But above all, I love good, fresh fish. I went to Sakana the other night with my mom and we sat at the bar. We just decided to embrace the fusion sushi experience. Everything we ate was amazing, though not necessarily traditional. We especially love the signature sushi and sashimi dishes, like the torched Yellowtail belly. The quality of the fish was top notch. The service was fantastic, fast and friendly.
I think if you are looking for a good sushi experience without a lot of mayo, etc, it's fully possible at Sakana. The menu is huge, overwhelming even. If you read through everything, you can certainly find something to fit your taste."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,This sushi lives up to the hype. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because of the 45 minute wait followed by rushed service. Still worth it in my book.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Sakana is one of the better sushi restaurants in town but nothing here in SB compares to SF or LA. The service is good but the tables are very cramped and it can get warm in there pretty quick. Well-priced compared to Arigato with less noise...
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,My favorite Sushi/Japanese restaurant in Santa Barbara.  Food was much better than I expected and service was so friendly and pleasant. I'll probably frequent here :)
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Hands down this is the BEST sushi restaurant I have ever been to - and I am not usually a big sushi fan... but I was so impressed with the quality of the sushi and the service, I will definitely be back. The service  was impeccable - from start to finish. We tried all sorts of the different items - the tastes, textures, and assortment offered was incredible! We had an absolutely wonderful time and enjoyed every minute. I want to give my compliments to the chefs! Thank you and we will be back!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"WOW!!!  Love this place.  We ate Sakana for the first time last night, sushi was A grade, service was super friendly & attenttive and the vibe was laid back.

 I stopped in with my daughter while driving from SLO back down to Venice after hitting some brutal traffic so we pulled off the 101 to let the traffic die down and get dinner.  The place seemed packed & buzzing for a Tues night but the hostess was amazing and seated us quickly at the sushi bar.  They had about 20+ sushi specials and i tried several of them - going strictly with the sushi chefs recommendations - and was not disappointed!  The toro, spanish mackeral, wild king salmon & wild white sea bass were rediculously fresh, next level stuff for sure.  My daughter opted for a few their specialty rolls which have the same high quality fish and quality ingredients - all super tasty.  Bottom line, they can cater to sushi/sashimi purists and folks looking for more creative rolls.  Its the quality of the fish that  makes it all work.

Can't remember the sushi chefs name at the far end of the bar but listen to the man, he knows fish and will hook you up!  (bad pun, sorry)   Anyhow, we both left saying 'what a treat' and it was, we jumped back on an empty 101 and flew home, satisfied from our new find.  I woke up the next day thinking about how good the food was...we will definitely go back!  -  Mb"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"The best sushi in town, actually the best I have ever had, and I eat a lot of sushi in a lot of place.  The staff is great, but the food.... WOW
It can get a little busy around the normal 7/8 as they don't take reservations.  So be patient, it is well worth it. 
The Champagne Fluke Caviar Sashimi is out of this world!
If you sit at the bar, Nowri (owner) & Teru (forgive the spelling) are great guys, and if you ask, the can make crazy stuff up just for you that's not part of the normal menu.  As others have said, if I could go over 5 stars, I would."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"SO GOOD! With such an expansive menu, I'll have to visit 4 more times before I'll be able to try everything I'd like to! I'd definitely say look at the menu before coming so you'll have a better handle on all the options - by far the best thing we had out of our 5 dishes was the Blackened Salmon Island Style roll. I wish we had just ordered multiple of those. Our server was patient and knew the menu very well. I can't wait to come back and if you haven't been here yet I highly recommend!!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I have to update my review. Sakana really grows on you and became a favorite spot for us in Santa Barbara. 

The sushi is good - we often get nigiri yellow tail belly, toro, and blue fin as well as salmon. They have a good selection and the fish is fresh and delicious.

Charlie loves the baked scallop roll more than any other place we have been or any other roll he has tried.

I still maintain that the rolls come with too much sauce, I especially don't like the red one that I think is made from beets, which is just my preference.

This is a good place to have in the line up to switch off with Arigato as they are completely different and you can keep things fresh that way. 

I only wish they took reservations."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Wow. The most innovative, extensive and absolutely delicious sushi menu I've ever had the pleasure to dine. There must be at least 75+ types of rolls, nigiri and other totally unconventional types of sushi items, starters and shared plates on Sakana's ample, mouthwatering menu. 

One of the sushi chefs, Mitsuru, is a face you might recognize from several of Santa Barbara's former sushi hot spots over the past decade-plus. To see him here was a *very* good sign, and he and Sakana far exceeded our expectations. 

An intimate space to be sure, Sakana is tucked in a distant corner of toney Montecito's small retail strip. Fantastic atmosphere, service, a great sake list, and a unique sushi experience. 

Not to be missed. Go get!!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"It's good. Unfortunately Santa Barbara lacks a fruitful variety when it comes to sushi, so it's no feat to rule out any competition. If I would have to pick, I would say Sakana is the best spot in town. The space is really small, so small that one of the waitresses dropped a menu on my roll while walking by. She quickly replaced it and if anything, we thought it was more amusing than a deal breaker.

Intimate and dark vibes. A bit of a wait but I was satisfied when I left. Will come back again"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"By far some of the best sushi we've had on the West Coast!! Had to wait for a bit for a table, but it was worth it! Try the Sakana Tower."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"The only reason I'm giving Sakana four stars is because of the price, it is very expensive! Their press boxes are the way to go. Out fav was the red jalapeño press box, divine."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"""Hands down the best sushi I have ever eaten: I dream of it at night,"" reads the last review by Sierra R. I could not say it better but will add a bit about the decor which others seem not to mention as noteworthy but certainly is. 

I have been eating sushi in SB for many years. This is fine dining sushi but depending upon what you order, just about 25% more than Kyoto, which is my favorite (happy hour Mon through Thurs 5 to 6, the best salad dressing of any Japanese restaurant anywhere in the country I've eaten, terrific sukiyaki and cooked meat as well as sushi). 

Yes, there are some very fancy appetizers and rolls but mine--the T and T (crab meat, spicy tuna, avocado with tuna and jalapeno and a dazzling array of sauces with equally dazzling presentation on the plate) was 14.50. I ordered two pieces of Ikura, salmon roe eggs which a friend calls ""balls of fishy heaven"" and with a large sake, it was 34 pre-tip

Yes, that's more than Kyoto (though NOT more than Arigato) but HERE is what Sakana has over that trendy, wannabe Nobu or Matsuhisa: a great Montecito, grown-up affluent crowd versus a younger, trendy, annoying wannabe affluent crowd downtown. I went to the old Arigato in Victoria Court years ago and yes, it was excellent and I enjoyed my meals

The new one is just wannabe hipster and people go there to prove they're cool which I can't bear. 

This is not a senior citizen Montecito 1%-2% crowd: it's the 45 to 55 set. The two women next to me at the sushi bar (high stools, extremely comfortable) were both moms having a mom dinner out without husbands or kids. They were the kind of women I love running into when I'm in NY and LA but never happen upon in SB because unless you have kids at Laguna Blanca, or perhaps Cate, you just don't meet this kind of female professional in that age range. 

The place is indeed small but it's NOT loud and there is no annoying Japanese rock to content with as at Shintori (whose fish has recently gone up a few notches and whose 10 dollar lunch is a regular event for me) or benign banal Japanese ballads (as at Kyoto). 

It's sleek, modern and white with an indigo hue and the servers are all very pretty, young (and oddly, Caucasian). I am in love with Sakana and while it's more a ""special occasion"" sushi (I didn't try the press boxes but saw countless dishes coming from the sushi bar where I saw, each one more scrumptious looking than the last), it's worth the money. 

Phenomenal food, adorable decor, good service, nice ambiance and a laid back affluent crowd 45 to 55 who live in Montecito. What more can one ask for? 

One pretty mom--really skinny, great jewelry--was waiting for her daughter, a tall skinny girl who looked just like her minus the bling, who came in exhausted from some sort of sports practice ready for dinner around 7PM. They reminded me of me and my mother except of course the jewelry as my beloved and esteemed mother is what I call ""pathologically frugal"" and only wears costume jewelry unless it was my Grandma's from the safe deposit box (or her wedding ring Dad designed in 1966). 

Mom and I started going to sushi bars--Hakata--casual but good old place 25 yrs old on Wilshire Blvd in Santa Monica when I was 7. This was definitely a mom with only one child: mothers with only one child (a daughter) are either very close or they don't get on at all and as someone who was called my mother's ""little best friend"" from 4 on, I can always spot a special mommy and daughter team

It's more than phenomenal food: you can actually feel wheels turning in smart, interesting people who travel a lot out of SB and have very pleasant lives. 

LOVE

P.S. I never knew anyone who came here and heard some awful things about how overpriced it was and how mediocre the fish. Not at all true. BUT the menu is overwhelming and it's best to ask your server what you should eat based on the preferences you express to her. Sitting at the sushi bar the first or second time is a good idea because you can ask your server what others are having among the dishes which catch your eye"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Great sushi bar!! Great portions! Small space so a little bit cramped but food is five star. One of the top places in SB. Similar quality to Arigato though I enjoy the atmosphere at Arigato better.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best tasting sushi in Santa Barbara. The menu is vast and extremely unique... some amazing options in there. Nice Ambience and servers, too. Highly recommended!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"The restaurant is tucked away in a nice little plaza serving the Montecito area so right away you can expect the prices to be higher than usual. Rolls and appetizers are around 15-25. Entrees in the 20s. 

The presentation of the food is excellent for their part, but a lot of the dishes are over seasoned with too many different flavors. I went for the more unique things while my friends found more traditional items. My Kobe beef sushi was over seasoned with ponzu so I could barely taste the beef. My friend's seared ahi had an interesting flavor with a fried garlic chip. However my piece again was drowned out with some sort of vinaigrette. 

Some of the simpler dishes were quite good like the tempura soft shelled crab, traditional scallop sushi with a little caviar, and the uni sushi.

We did try one 'specialty roll' the ""habanero lobster melt."" Which was surprisingly quite good.  It had a nice balance of habanero with mango that went well with the seared lobster. Very complicated flavors, but the lobster held up to it. I think that is key to ordering here. Finding items that will stand up to their barrage of different sauces and flavors.

I can understand nontraditional sushi, but it just seems a lot of the dishes were too complex or over seasoned so it becomes hard to even taste the ingredient that you ordered. Rather than accentuating the flavor of the fish, they tend to smother it with sauces. For the prices they're charging, I can't give it more than 3 stars."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"My wife and I stopped by last week and saw a line so we thought must be good.  It was as far as friendliness but the food was somewhat marginal compared to other sushi places.  The spicy tuna and crispy rice a bit too greasy, my wife ordered a crab roll and it was saturated with a mayonnaise (or something like mayonnaise).   I can't say it was bad it was a nice place to eat this rating is based on other places we like."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"By far the best sushi in Santa Barbara. This is one of my favorite restaurants ever. The fish is always super fresh. I like the press boxes. Habanero Yellowtail Melt, Crispy rice & Spicy Tuna, Toro Box- can't go wrong! It's reasonably priced for a fancy sushi experience as well!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"My boyfriend and I came here today on a Saturday at about 5:30 PM. It had a very dim and modern interior, and jellyfish danced on the large TV screen while jazz played. We were seated immediately and our server brought us iced waters quickly, but that was where the promptness ended.
Though we had arrived so early after opening, it appeared that they were out of live uni already. We ordered the Black Widow, Habanero Yellowtail, Habanero Lobster, and Pyramid rolls.
After 20-30 minutes of waiting, we got a large plate of 2 rolls, one of which was the Red Dragon. We tried one piece each of the rolls when our server came by again and said that we had received the wrong order (I initially thought nothing was wrong because we were discussing getting Red Dragon before) and took our plate away. Then we waited perhaps 5 more minutes before we started getting our correct orders.
The Black Widow and the Pyramid rolls were nothing special. Having researched Yelp beforehand I was especially excited for the Habanero Yellowtail and Lobster (which was surprisingly spicy) rolls, but they were also not so delicious. Overall, the only thing I tried that I favored particularly was the single piece from the Red Dragon roll.
The rolls fell apart very easily, and the sauces are interesting, but to be similarly applied to every plate without variation ruined the appeal. Our bill came out to be $60.
Lastly, it was amusing that the change I was to receive ($40) came out in mostly singles and fives.."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Can I do 10 stars?
I would if I could.
Listen, I'm no sashimi/sushi expert, at all.  I came here with my niece Meghan, who use to work here (and from what I understand, was a kick ass waitress) and let her order all the things one should order. My unsophisticated raw fish palate was singing.  I couldn't believe that raw fish, paired with delicate sauces of habañero, cilantro, etc, could be so tasty. I don't think I'll ever be able to go to another sushi bar and not compare everything to my experience here.  How will I manage? How will I go on, without experiencing that one roll with that habañero sauce, raw scallops and tempura shrimp so skillfully rolled, goodness??
Apparently the menu is large & according to those who ""know"" this little gem, you literally can't go wrong.
It will be my first stop during my next visit.
No doubt."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Incredible. Truly best sushi in town. Habanero Yellowtail and Salmon/Mango/Passion Fruit rolls are my favorites! Yes it's pricey, but you will be full, and you will leave with a smile on your face. Make the drive and plan for one of the best romantic dinners in town!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I write this review to warn people who are traditionalists when it comes to eating sushi to never set foot in this restaurant. If you can appreciate balsamic vinegar in your sushi rice and basil aoli drizzled all over your sushi roll then this is the place for you. I don't. I sat at the sushi bar and ordered a chirashi box, it came with balsamic vinegar rice and a pile of not so fresh fish. I could taste the fishiness while chewing through the sinews. I love sashimi and frequent Sushi Go 55 (Los Angeles) for sashimi and wait in line for an hour to sit at the bar at Taiko (Irvine)--I know my fish. I also know that you don't get the best cut of the fish when you order a chirashi box, but c'mon what I got was unacceptable. On the other hand, my finance loves this place and cherishes every drop of the special sauces (there are four kinds and they appear on just about every roll) the chef uses on the specialty rolls."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is such a pretty place, small but pretty , the service is fast and efficient, the food is ridiculously delicious."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is my favorite sushi spot in Santa Barbara. The tipping point for Sakana is the atmosphere. I won't lie, there is some pretty great fresh fish in this town, and you won't be disappointed if you end up at any of the other solid sushi joints ... but my recommendation is to skip the hype at Arigato, skip the college-town vibe at Edomasa, and go straight for Sakana. This charming sushi bar nestled into Montecito offers a classy, cool ambiance that makes your equally classy and cool rolls and sashimi an experience rather than a meal. The minimalist, white decor and limited seating adds a classy edge without going overboard."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Wow! I am really impressed with Sakana Sushi! The fish was so fresh!! The presentation was amazing!!! I have never had a roll with so many different flavors, colors, and sauces without it being overwhelming. I didn't even want to use soy sauce (it's that good) I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this place!! I will be definitely become a regular here!! Best sushi place in town!! You will not be disappointed! The box basil crab roll is definitely something you should start with ;)"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Super friendly staff with great service. The sushi is amazing and I am picky with sushi quality! The rainbow roll and TNT roll were my favorites!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This sushi restaurant is very small, but can be a romantic spot for a date. The menu is extremely long which I find a little frustrating, but the food makes it well worth it. Most the sushi plates here are served with the same 3 sauces that I don't really like to be honest, but the fish itself is extremely fresh and quality."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I had not been to Sakana in several years since I live in Hawaii... I was stoked to take my brother and his wife here on my last trip over. The food was as good as ever and our waitress from Maui was delightful. The 45 minute wait was a bummer but that is standard here, luckily we had a couple cold beers in the car to pass the time. This is California style sushi at its best!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"One of my fav sushi places. Con a bit too small, does not taste as good as a take out. Must experience it in."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I love this place! This tiny hole in the wall sushi restaurant makes the best rolls, has the best salads, and has a romantic atmosphere. Although I've only gone on girls night dates here, I would bet it is a great date place for a couple. The restaurant is dimly lit and there aren't that many tables so there is usually a wait, but it's worth it. Try the edaname with whatever sauce they put on it! Love it!

It is pricey, like $20-30 per person, but it is so worth it to treat yourself to a nice sushi dinner."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"AMAZING. Press boxes are phenomenal. Basil Fluke--well, let's just say we ordered three. They've got this spicy sauce that is literally the best thing I have ever eaten. The presentation is beautiful. The premises are a bit cramped but the food 100% makes up for it. It's expensive, but I cannot even explain how worth it it is. I highly recommend."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Wow has this place changed in the past year!  We used to come here fairly often, but in the past year we've probably only been here once every couple of months.  My sister in law was in town and really wanted sushi.  My wife suggested Arigato, but we wanted Edomasa or Sakana, and ultimately decided on Sakana and were extremely disappointed, so much so that we will probably not be going back any time soon.

First, the garlic albacore was so cold, it tasted like the plate had been pre-made and was served right from the refrigerator.  The black cod was so salty that we had to send it back.  The waitress apologized and said that the miso glaze was pre-made, and that the owner would have to try it later.  However, even after we had paid our bill, we asked if anyone had tried it, and they had not.  The final straw though was wen we sent back the ankimo sashimi, as it had a very chalky consistency and was too fishy tasting.  We typically order ankimo whenever it is available, and this was the worst we had ever experienced.  If that wasn't enough though, the watress came back and said that the owner had tasted the ankimo and said that there was nothing wrong with it and would only take half the cost off the bill.  What audacity, and I suppose that the black cod was not too salty either?  Oh that's right...you didn't even bother to check.

Needless to say, we'll be spending more time at Arigato and Edomasa instead of here."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Best sushi in SB! Moved down from Northern California and was very frustrated with the poor quality sushi down here. I described to a co-worker the kind of sushi I like and they recommended Sakana. Great tasting rolls. A little pricy but worth every bite. I think we found our new sushi spot!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"We have sushi every Friday night wherever we go. This is hands down the best California sushi we have had. The menu is very extensive with so many great options. The fish is extremely fresh, but the sushi rice is what makes it exceptional. The sauces are delicate and compliment the rolls very well. I appreciate that sauces are on the plate and not slathered over the rolls."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"BEST SUSHI IN SANTA BARBARA. Don't go here if you want a typical California roll and spicy mayo. Go here and sit at the sushi bar, talk to the sushi chefs, get recommendations and try something you haven't before! Shout out to the Ninja, Captain and most of all Gangsta of sushi. First time having Uni and I'm changed for life. Great selection of sake. I'll be back for sure."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"The sushi is good, but the place is super tiny crowded. Don't expect to have a romantic or private conversation here. It's really dark so bring your glasses and a flashlight to read the menu. The sushi is always good and fresh and the presentation is beautiful but you pay for the location. There are better sushi places in Santa Barbara, but if you want to stay in Montecito for sushi you will get good sushi at a premium. If there is a wait you'll have to wait outside or stand next to someone's table, and I don't think it worth the wait, unless like I said your in Montecito and don't want to go into SB. I sort of recommend this place."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Definitely not as good as Arigato. A lot of the sauces don't really compliment the fish. And the portions of fish are quite small, lots of rice and fillings in the rolls. Goleta Sushi House still the best value if you want big portions of fresh sushi"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Oh my gosh, this place was phenomenal!  Cute little place tucked away in the far end of a shopping center.  You'd never think it could be so great but it soooo was!!!  My husband and I went to SB for a little anniversary getaway and found Sakana on Yelp.  The atmosphere was cute, the wait wasn't terribly long and the service was great.  But most important, the sushi was so fresh, unique and melt in your mouth delicious.  I would definitely go back and I highly recommend to anyone in the area!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,I went here before food was good  but last night sushi Rice under cook. I understand it was an off day . but as a sushi chef I will never serve under cook rice. Server was nice and helpful. Fish was OK. Toro was Chu toro not regular toro. . nigiri all different size..some big other small. It's all supposed to be the same size. The gunkan had too much rice.. I'll be back one day again to try u guys again thank u.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Great sushi. Fresh as can be, service was a little lax, but all in all a great and tasty time."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I know it's hard to make such a definitive statement, but Sakana is my favorite restaurant. No I did not say favorite sushi restaurant, I just plainly said favorite. The best. Those who complain about Sakana not being ""real sushi"" are probably ordering the wrong thing if they want ""real sushi"" because they do in fact have raw fish laid over rice. However, do not make the mistake of ordering such a thing at Sakana, because although their fish is fresh enough to impress on it's own, their creative combinations are absolutely to die for. It's been said a 1000 times but the habanero yellowtail pressbox is the best thing that's ever been in my mouth. The one downside to the place is it is indeed small and does not take reservations so on a weekend night it could take 40+ minutes to be seated... but it's worth it. I left SB about a month ago, and I often find myself daydreaming about Sakana."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I live near this restaurant so we go quite often.  It isn't as good as it was a few years ago, very popular and quite expensive. 
Sometimes you have to wait for your ordered food for a long time. The place is too small to have any more wait staff. 
The variety is maybe too great and therefore, has lost it's special magic."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"The fish for the Sashimi and Sushi was so fresh.  I loved the quality of the food.  Good specials and variety of different dishes.  The place was a bit on the small side, but the only reason I didn't give them a five stars was the service.  This place either needs more wait staff to handle the demand during the dinner rush or train the wait staff to relax and be pleasant to the patronage.  I hope it gets better.  I plan to go back because the food is definitely worth it.

Cheers"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best sushi I have ever had. Yellowtail sashimi melts in your mouth. So many fun and creative rolls, you will want to try them all."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I'm very surprised to read so many positive reviews from this place. This tells me that I got unlucky, and had my first Sakana experience on an evening when the food was subpar. It's almost comical that Montecito really doesn't have very many great restaurants. There's Lucky's and if you love Mexican, there is Los Arroyos. Good luck trying to find a sushi place in Montecito at least one that could compete with any sushi bar in LA. That said, Sakana was recommended to me as being the only place in Montecito where the sushi will be fresh. We ordered from their online menu and when it was called in, we were told that menu is no longer up to date. We asked where we could find the ""up to date"" menu and they told us to look on Yelp, someone had posted pictures of it! Really? That should have been the first sign...but we were in the mood for sushi so we ignored it. After locating the cellphone photos posted of their menu, we ordered Yellow Tail with Habanero sauce (sashimi), a Yellow Tail and Shrimp Specialty Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll T&T and Green Salad with Avocado and Tomato on the side. It sounded delicious - CUE THE PAVLOV TEST VISUALS! What we ended up with was one disappointing bag of sadness. Everything was jam backed with RICE and it was chewy! Even the ""sashimi"" which was not sushimi at all. The yellowtail seemed like it was actually cooked, and it was a dark gray color which indicated that it was. I would absolutely NEVER EVER recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sushi and I'm bummed about this review because I wanted Montecito to have a great (as in memorable GOTTA GET BACK THERE) restaurant experience to rave about...but sadly, for the most part, the food in Montecito is overpriced and underwhelming. You're better off going into Santa Barbara. One would think that a neighborhood with such affluence would have some of the finest restaurants in the state, if not the country. I'd be interested to hear from other diners to see if they believe that Montecito is lacking quality restaurants. Anyhow...I'd go to Vons before Sakana for sushi!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Coming from SF, I was not really expecting such AMAZING sushi in SB. This is my #1 restaurant in SB, and up there on the list of favorite all-time favorite restaurants. If you like specialty sushi rolls, this is your place. They have some of the most unique sushi rolls I've ever had, and each of them is different and delicious. The menu is definitely a little overwhelming, so ask the server for suggestions! I've never been disappointed. Their sashimi is also extremely fresh. 

Make sure you put aside at least 30-45 minutes for the wait, they don't take reservations and it gets really busy. Also, don't sit by the door. I realize it's a small restaurant and they want to maximize all the space they can, but it can be cold sitting there, super loud (since the hostess is right there), and the servers forget about you."

The staff are friendly and will remember you and make you feel very welcome if you've been in a few times. I've eaten here on my birthday every year that I've lived in this area and plan to keep up that tradition. The food is so fresh and the flavours are incredible. I love taking friends visiting from out of town here. The habanero yellowtail melt is something you should definitely try!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"STAY AWAY.  You have been warned.  Is it possible to give a NEGATIVE STAR?!

I rather shred money in a paper shredder than eat at this hell hole.  Anyone that thinks this place is edible need to get their taste buds checked.  If you're a stupid American that thinks Japanese food is all about eating ""Sushi Rolls"", then I forgive you, you don't know any better.

We went there and ordered the seared ahi tuna, stuffed shiitake mushrooms, sashimi combination, and sweet shrimp.  

First off, the Seared Ahi Tuna.  The lousy thing is DRENCHED in sauce that tastes like peanut butter with miso.  The so called Seared Ahi Tuna is 8 slices, PAPER THIN.  Seared Ahi Tuna should be cooked on the outside (top and bottom), leaving the middle part raw; hence the word ""SEARED"".  Usually it's cut into at least 1/4"" thick slices.  This place was paper thin.  To add more insult, they so called ""sear it"" after the tuna is sliced, leaving one side of the tuna cooked, and the other side (flip it over) completely raw.  

Stuffed Shittaki mushroom - What's so stuffed about it when they just put imitation crab meat on TOP of one 1/16"" slice of Shittaki mushroom?  The imitation crab meat also contains mayonnaise.  Do yourself a favor and just buy a TUB of imitation crab meat from your local grocery store and it'll taste a lot better.  

Sashimi Combination - So you pick 3 out of the 5 choices.  We picked Yellow Tail, Salmon, and Tuna.  THE TUNA WAS HALF COOKED.  Last time I checked, sashimi is SUPPOSE TO BE RAW, not cooked.  We didn't even finish it.  

Sweet Shrimp - WTF?!  They cover the shrimp with ridiculous mango sauce and top it with unusual spices.  It was suppose to be caviar on top.  I've never tasted caviar that wasn't salty.   

We ordered Uni but nooooo, they didn't have any. 

The place is so small and crowded, the staff had a hard time getting the food to us because they didn't even have space to walk to the table.  Staff was super slow in getting orders in.  

At the end, we left many things uneaten.  I don't even think a trash can would even take the junk from this restaurant.  

Unless you're a stupid American that think eating Japanese food is pumping your stomach with stupid sushi rolls, go right ahead and be fooled.  You have been warned."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"This was a stop in my never-ending quest to find the perfect Oyako donburi at a local eatery.  This place definitely didn't fit the bill.  I ordered Oyako Ju; the sauce was pretty good, on the sweeter side, but the chicken was extremely tough and dry.  I might have rated this place lower, but a friend ordered a teriyaki/roll combo and liked it.

This place seems to have a community of regulars.  When we were there, the majority of patrons who came in (altho not together) knew each other as well as the waitress."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is a very good place.  They seem to focus on their specialty rolls as opposed to nigiri.  The montecito was very delightful, light and filled with a variety of sauces.  The kiwi roll had a great tang as well from the kiwi.

The nigiri was very good as well the spanish mackarel, yellow tail and tuna tasting fresh and melting in my mouth.  The salmon on the other hand was not so great.  The wait was a bit long, but worth it.  It was a little difficult having to order through the waitress for everything as opposed to filling out a sheet."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Dark, trendy, and mouth-wateringly delish! I'm a saucy kind of girl so this place satisfies with a vast array of dipping options. Hubby and I ordered the Kiwi Mango Ahi Press box roll (huge btw), the Habanero Yellowtail roll, and the Sakana roll. That Kiwi Mango roll has appeared in my dreams nightly ever since! I also love the fact that you're so close to the other diners that by the end of your meal, you have new friends and a list of items to order for the next time you come in. The close proximity thing is also why I didn't give it 5 stars...it makes me feel too nosy when I jump in on other people's convos. Overall, yum!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sidle up to the sushi bar and ask the chef to surprise you.  If you're jonesing for traditional sushi in the purest sense, look elsewhere. However, if you're in the mood for knock-your-socks-off fusion cuisine bursting with flavor and creativity, you've come to the right place.

Beautifully plated sushi creations with unusual touches like habanero sauce, basil oil, and champagne are just a few of the surprises awaiting you at Sakana. I am admittedly a sushi snob, and I was just blown away by the explosion of flavors. I wanted to shout, ""There's a party in my mouth, and you're all invited!""

Yes, there will be a wait (unless you're a lucky solo diner like me, who is able to grab the last vacant seat at the sushi bar), and no, this isn't bargain dining.  What it is, is an unforgettable experience that will leave you wanting more."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Sakana is our home away from home...We are there 1-2 times a week and I must say EVERYTHING is spot on! Great service! Best sushi in town! Friendly and prompt staff! Nobody comes close to this place!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"The food was good, tasted fresh-- but very filling. The menu was a little overwhelming because there was so much to choose from (which can be a good, or bad thing). The service wasn't impressive. Our water glasses were empty and we had to ask for refills. Maybe cos it's so dark in the restaurant that the servers couldn't see... The ambience was cute and romantic. The restaurant is quite small, and it took 45 minutes to seat 4 people because the hostess gave our table away when she didn't see me out in the parking lot. They were pretty busy for a Sunday night. I would try it again on a weeknight to see if we can get better service because the food was pretty good, but not necessarily worth all the waiting around."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This place really does take sushi to the next level.  Where this place excels is in thier sauces.  I know a lot of people who actually take offense to this.  They would say, a sushi restaurant shouldn't excel in their sauces but rather their fresh fish.  I agree, but fresh fish shouldn't be the differentiating factor in a great sushi place.  They should all have fresh fish and that is generally what they all have in common.  Sakana's really sets the standard in great forward looking sushi cuisine. 

Getting back to the sauces, I think they have a reduced beet sauce, butter wasabi, a curry sauce, and one other which I can't place at this time.  All the sushi weather it is sashimi, rolls, or press box  are placed on the plate and the sauce are artfully drawn around the sushi.  If you're not a fan of the sauces than you don't have to dip.  If you are like everyone else I know that loves sakana than you will probably bring a loaf of French bread and sop up the sauces when the sushi is gone.  don't worry we all do it.  I suggest as a starter to get the grilled stuff calamari, it's devine!  

Go to Sakana. The restaurant is rather small so I recommend groups not be larger than 5.  It's a bit more expensive than most places but then again it's located in a high rent, above average disposable income city."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Really fresh fish and really inventive flavor combinations in the rolls. It is a very tiny place though so you may want to make reservations or prepare to wait.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Amazing sushi.  Sauces are so unique.  Combinations are so unique.  Pressed boxes are amazing.  Sounds silly but their ginger is so fresh and sweet.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sushi just doesn't get better. It's a small place with not a lot of tables. It has the same flat-screen TV showing a fish tank as it did 5 years ago when I last was there. The sushi is just as good - amazing.

It has the best, most tasty, most creative sushi rolls I've ever had. Really interesting - and great presentation. The service is nice, too.

I love this place."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Hands down, the best sushi I have had in my entire life. The pricing is high but it is worth it. The quality, taste, presentation of food, staff and service are superb. The only downside is the space. It's very small and can get packed quickly so if you're not a fan a small places, be aware it's a small restaurant. It wasn't an issue for me as it brought out a nice intimate vibe/ambiance."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"This is an extreme Ameri-Sushi experience. We rolled into this swinging hot spot for dinner and were lucky to get a table at 7:00 on a Sunday night. We had been told about a Habinero Lobster melt that we just had to try. Thankfully we also ordered some sashimi first which was quite good, fish was fresh, they use brown rice which is different - a little healthier but harder to eat. When the much anticipated Lobster Melt arrived we were excited but soon lost our will to eat. I scraped some of the layers of sauce off to try to get through the rest of our roll. I think they should have rolled it in a taco, then a pizza and served it in a commemorative bag of chili. 

If you like really untraditional sushi-inspired food with lots of sauces this might be your dream come true."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Came here on a Friday evening. I give the food 4-stars, but the restaurant is so ridiculously small that you can't even have a good conversation with a friend across from you because you're rubbing elbows with the stranger next to you! By the time I left, maybe around 8:00pm, the restaurant emptied out so it got a little quieter.

Sushi rolls are definitely different. My review is on cooked rolls. It was SO good!! My roll had tomatoes and some sort of mango sauce with baked salmon (which I had to request), and special mayo sauce! The boyfriend had something with eel and soy paper. The prices are a little outrageous, but I'd pay the extra $ for something out of the ordinary. If you don't like to sushi that is out of the ordinary with unusual ingredients, I don't recommend this restaurant to you. But if you love to try new things, this is a must-try!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"First time here, sat at the sushi bar and the party started. I started off with the usual yellowtail, albacore, salmon, and tuna sushi just to give the place a taste and was very pleased with the freshness and taste of each fish. All 4 were melt in your mouth soft and no weird fishy taste some places have. 

After these starter dishes we ordered about 6 more rounds, we mainly asked the chefs to make us what they like and what they recommend. We tried everything from fins to sea urchins and were delighted by each and every piece we tried. I believe the toro and the yellowtail belly were my favorites by far (in terms of straight sushi nothing else). We had a couple of specialty rolls as well and even tried monk fish liver which tasted much anchovies. ‍ try this place out, you won't be disappointed."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Amazing sushi! Amazing service! They don't take reservations and it is a small place, so avoid high times or plan to wait! Either way it is worth it!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I have enjoyed this restaurant three times over the last month, and in the entire Santa Barbara County area there is nothing that comes close. If you're a world traveler, food snob, food critic, or just plain foodie you will enjoy this amazing Little restaurant. 
The freshness of the fish, the exciting and creative use of sauces and presentation put it on another level. My wife and I have both been chefs and it's one of the only places in the Santa Barbara area we both equally crave"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Amazing sushi.  Yellowtail was super fresh and the special rolls were amazing. I had dinner here with my daughter and we went nuts on the special rolls.  It's hard to say what was our favorite: caterpillar, Hawaiian, or zipang.  My daughter went from cucumber roll to sushi to sashimi.  It was that good."

It has fantastic atmosphere, white table cloths, bud vases with single roses and candles.  The menu is outstanding with 6 pages of rolls, appetizers, sushi etc.  A few of our ""out of this world"" favorites were T&T roll, Habinero Yellow Tail Press box and the Pink Spider roll and 1/2 and 1/2 sushi.  You have to try this place, it is the whole package!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is my favorite sushi place!!! Some people have complained about the sauces, and how they are overpowering, but in my opinion I think they are delicious, and add a twist to common dishes. 
 I am a huge fan of the Press Boxes. My VERY FAVORITE is the Habinero Yellow Tail Press Box. OMG, it's like heaven in your mouth, with angels everywhere!!! Some other good ones to try are the Sakana Press Box, and the Protein Roll. Also, a great, great, great appetizer is the Carpaccio, I usually get an order of  the yellow tail and tuna. Amazingly fresh, and the sauces that come with the carpaccio are unbeatable.
The service is mediocre, but I have had some good service from time to time. 
**Make sure you are not starving if you go here, because 1) you might have to wait to be seated (they don't take reservations) and 2) you might end up eating half the menu. :)"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is your best sushi place in the SB area!!! Great locals place that you kind of have to know about via word of mouth (since it's tucked in the corner of a little shopping center in Montecito). NOT CHEAP, but hands down DELICIOUS! They have a very large menu so there should definitely be something for everyone! Everything I have ever tried here has been wonderful, and they're generous with their sauce servings! 

My boyfriend once got this baked lobster lasagna looking thing and it was TO DIE FOR! Very rich and full of fat and calories, but it's definitely a MUST try. Not sure of the name of it but just keep that in mind if you're in the mood to try it sometime. The spicy tuna is pretty good (not the absolute best I've ever had but good enough to order it each time I go). Spicy Scallop roll is a must! They also have a good selection of saki, so be sure to indulge in that too!

TIP #1: This place is SMALL and gets VERY packed so try to go early around 5-6pm or later around 8-9pm (if you don't want to wait for 45+ minutes). They don't take reservations either, so plan accordingly. WORTH THE WAIT THOUGH!! 

TIP #2: Sit at the sushi bar if you want quicker service.

TIP #3: They're closed on Mondays."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"By far, THEE BEST SUSHI in Santa Barbara! I was recently introduced to them through a friend, thankfully! They have this thing called a ""pressbox,"" rather than your regular ""roll."" The staff is very friendly, their presentation is BEAUTIFUL, and the sushi is to die for! My favorite is the Habanero Yellowtail Melt. It is the best!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"There comes a time in every reviewer's life that he has to swallow his own words, like the very food he scrutinizes.

That moment came for me at Sakana.  I know I have been an adamant ""authentic"" sushi fan, favoring pure fish quality over roll creativity.  But Sakana was, shockingly, enough for me to bat for the roll team.

Unbelievable, is about all I can say.  Sakana's very able chefs have uncovered unprecedented convergences of flavors unlike I had ever experienced.  Grilled banana plus salmon?  Terrific.  Yes, terrific.  

These people know what they are doing.  It might not be ""sushi"" in the authentic sense, but it is delicious in the very real sense."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,YUMMY THIS PLACE IS GOODD. Go here with a partner tho cause it has a very romantic atmosphere with dimmed lighting. They have a very interesting set of dishes that arent as ordinary as the ones you find at regular sushi restaurants. The sauces are also very interesting and I love love love the seaweed yummayyy. It is like quite pricey so be ready to spend spend spend boyssss jk. But rly tho it is expensive. The restaurant is really small so if you go when its crowdedbe prepared to wait a long time 8(. Service is friendly! I went here for a first date with my ex baahahahah. I was a vegetarian during that time so I got the veggie roll and it was quite nice.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"So I showed up seven minutes before my daughter came down from college to meet her for dinner. I'm from out of town and was told I had to wait until she arrived. There were at least 20 open seats and yet I was not allowed to sit down have a beverage or an appetizer. I could've said I was a party of one and then have her join me at the table when she arrived.     I chose the honest route, and honestly I will never dine in here again. I will have dinner, and make this my last visit to this restaurant.  There are many more places in town that would be happy for my business."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"My hubby and college son went on an evening before we dropped him off to UCSB. He wanted sushi. We all love sushi

That being said, the place rather small, and it was packed. We got a table so close to the door and cash-register, kinda made us feel like we might as well be on the patio.... might I suggest the restaurant simply get rid of it?  I appreciate you want to turn tables over but it did feel a bit...well, like we were about out the door.

We ordered the Louisiana roll, Montecito, Hanabi, Coco Shrimp, Sashimi Herb Salmon and Yellow Tail.

It is inventive, well prepared sushi.  Clearly this is a restaurant trying to play with flavors and offer their customers something off the beaten path. 

I ordered a local chardonnay along with dinner. It was fine.
But....
Restaurants need to be a combination of good food and good service with some warmth thrown in, that sense that the place is glad you came, and welcomes you.

I am so sorry, but perhaps it was packed. Perhaps it was backed up in kitchen (we waited awhile for food) and perhaps it was a waitress just a little overworked.

We won't be back. Maybe that is a good thing. Seems they need the extra tables! 

 But in fairness, the sushi we had tasted wonderful. I just wish that particular night we hadn't hit the place when it was having an off night. It happens."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Beware- the Yelp reviews are very misleading.  I would avoid this place and go elsewhere.

Geez, where to begin?  Let's start by saying, this is the worst sushi I've ever had, and I've tried a lot of different sushi at various price points.  The sushi at Whole Foods is actually better, so that should tell you something.   The prices are some of the highest I've seen, yet the quality is incredibly low.  So why are there so many glowing Yelp reviews??  Something doesn't add up....

First of all, the menu is quite extensive, but not in a good way.  The dizzying array of options was overwhelming, and it took my boyfriend and I forever to decide.  Second, we were surprised by how high the prices were, but we assumed it meant that the fish would be outstanding.  They were a lot higher than usual, even for a high-end restaurant.  Third, the flavor combinations seemed a little too eclectic, which caused me to wonder if this place was trying too hard.

My boyfriend and I started with the following nigiri: yellowtail, salmon, king salmon, aburi (fatty) salmon, albacore, bluefin tuna and eel.  We also ordered ponzu sauce on the side.  The nigiri was absolutely bland and completely lackluster.  The fish was chewy and did not melt in my mouth.  The sushi rice was awful- dense, flavorless and too thick, which defeats the purpose of having nigiri.  It was like eating a rice patty with a strip of fish.  Oddly enough, as dense as the rice was, it fell apart and did not hold together like it should.  It also had a strange brown color, which suggests that they used balsamic vinegar, instead of rice vinegar.  The eel was coated in a red wine sauce which was overly acidic and overwhelmed the fish.  Even the ponzu was terrible, tasting purely of balsamic vinegar and lacking a lovely citrus taste.  Complete fail.

Next, we had the following rolls: crispy spicy tuna, toro and herbed yellowtail.  These rolls definitely tasted better than the nigiri, but only because they were drowning in a bunch of different sauces.  We couldn't really taste the fish at all.  I will say that the presentation was nice and pleasing to look at, but it was very clear that they were trying to cover up the flavorless fish and bland rice with spicy mayo and soy sauce.

The final item we ordered was the Chilean sea bass misozuke, which is under their hot appetizers.  The quality of the sea bass was good, and the texture was quite tender and luscious, as you would expect from sea bass.  However, the sauce lacked complexity and tasted too sweet.  Also, there were bones in my fish.  Considering this tiny appetizer costs almost $20, the least they could do was remove the bones.

The only reason why this place even deserves one star, is because the service is very good.  My boyfriend and I came in shortly after they opened on a Saturday evening, and a friendly hostess seated us immediately.  Our server (Ana) was very sweet and went above and beyond.  The busboy constantly refilled our water glasses.  The food came out quickly.  

All in all, such a disappointing experience and a complete waste of money.  Our bill came to over $200 after tip, so we feel especially angry at the fact that we dumped a significant amount on poor quality seafood.  If you don't know what delicious, authentic sushi should taste like, and you enjoy being overcharged for what can only be described as ""white people sushi,"" as it's drowned in heavy, salty sauces, then this place is for you.  The owners are trying way too hard to be unique and eclectic, and they're so determined to dazzle the customer with their ridiculous flavor combinations, that they forgot the two most important aspects of a sushi restaurant: high-quality, flavorful fish and perfectly balanced sushi rice.  Such a shame!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This was one of the best sushi restaurants i have been...

i love sashimi and a lot of different sauces...it is usually not easy to find places with multiple sauces like his one...like six sauces came decoratively on each sushi plate

i got the roll w/o rice in cucumber
curry shrimp sushi
sea bass sushi i think jalepeno

i only had a little rice on the sushi but it seemed different than most a little darker almost like brown rice and really moist

i just think that soup and salad should come with the lunch and not charged individually

i have been to a lot of highend sushi places that give soup and pickled cucumbers or salad included even edanami"

I highly recommend this spot!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Pretty good. Not as good as Arigato. Price point is higher...could be due to the rent and location.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I was so excited to have my birthday dinner from this place. We got it to-go. Unfortunately, the rice on all the sushi, rolls and press boxes were al dente. That's fine if it was pasta or risotto but sushi rice shouldn't be. The fish is raw but the rice shouldn't be. The only item on my nigiri sushi and rolls that were cooked by them is rice and they got that wrong. Was it an off day, maybe, but a sushi place should be able to get that right. I don't even know if the Toro, ikura, uni, yellow tail or albacore was good because it was taken over by raw rice.  I cannot give this place a second chance."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"If Sakana were a human being, I would marry it. This place is absolutely fucking fantastic. The customer service is exquisite. Ambience? Incredible. Lets talk about the sushi... I ordered the white dragon roll and my mother ordered the Merry Go Round role and we found ourselves actually moaning to how good this meal was. The ponzu sauce is also worth mentioning. Fantastic. When I die, bury me at Sakana."

wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I was sorely disappointed by this place. The experience (atmosphere, service, wait) was actually pretty pleasant...

However, the food is over-hyped on Yelp. Waaay over-hyped. I wish I knew that the reviews I had read prior to visiting Sakana were based on the ""American Sushi"" experience, because I was expecting something more authentic for my hard-earned money. However, if you want mayonnaise and cream-cheese laden brown rice, then this might actually be just the place for you!

When ordering, none of the regular rolls appealed to me so we ordered press boxes (this should have been my second heads-up that this place was not, in any way, traditional). Loose, barely sticky brown rice was adorned with cooked (yes COOKED) fish and splashes of at least 4 different types of mayo were on every plate. I don't get it, isn't the point of sushi to TASTE the quality of the fish and seafood? What are they hiding from with all that sauce?

Next time I drop the better part of a bill on dinner, I'll do at at Arigato."

wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Cool atmosphere, friendly sushi chefs. Hostess seemed a little distracted but maybe because it was quite busy. Sushi was very good.  I wish they had more options that did not involve fake crab though, that cheapens sushi rolls in my book and makes the flavor not as unique. I had that lobster habanero press box or whatever it was some of the other reviewers suggested but honestly wasn't that impressed by it. 
Great sake selection. Pricey but worth it on occasion."

Walking in there it looked very promising with all the over priced sushi you would think it would be fresh. My girlfriend and I ordered some rolls and nigiri. When the waitress set the food on the table I can already smell the stink from the fish. The plating did look pretty. Nonetheless, we ate the food talking shit under our breath on how we've had so much better at lower end places. As a customer I should have said something..."

We love this place and it's a Friday night treat for us. I was tired and just had diet coke instead of Sake and boyfriend had one beer only, so it wasn't too expensive. 
We had to wait almost 20 minutes, which was odd given there was almost no one waiting. It's not unusual on a summer night to see a horde of people outside. 
Everyone had just sat down when we arrived around 8PM during this late year heat, but it was very fast once we got seated."

They offer press box menu, which is unique and perfect for someone doesn't enjoy seaweed. 
All the dishes are really fresh, tasty, and colorful, really pleasant to my eyes and tummy. 
My favorite dishes are Kobe beef press box, seared tuna press box, enoki mushroom wrapped kobe beef, ahi poke salad, ginger sesame tofu, etc. (check the pretty photos below) :) 
They also have wide variety of drinks/sakes. I always order a bottle of Shichiken sake - junmai ginjo (you can ask to take it togo if the bottle is unfinished) 
I always recommend my guests and friends to check Sakana when they are in town!"

I was alone so basically walked right in and got seated at the sushi bar. At first I was brought water and a menu. Ordered some miso soup and the vegetarian roll. The soup was brought quickly but the sushi took almost 25 minutes after I ordered. The waiters never came to refill my water. Waited for 10 minutes to get my check even with all the staff talking at the register I was seated 5 feet from. I wanted to see if they would notice I was ready and funny that a waiter not serving my table was the one to help me out. Small portions and mediocre service but outstanding food!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,Sat at the sushi bar the other day to get a quick bite. Sushi was good. Cool specialty rolls.Our blonde waitress was unbelievably rude and not accommodating! Worst service I ever had. Just because of her I will never come back to eat at this restaurant.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I would give Sakana 5+ stars if I could. This is hands down the BEST Sushi ever!!! You don't need soy sauce, instead just enjoy the fabulous flavors and sauces on the plates. The rolls are big, colorful and loaded with flavor!!!! Each one looks like a piece of art. Must trys are: Tuna Carpaccio Volcano, Grilled stuffed calamari, TNT roll, Red Wine eel roll and the Tofu Cheese cake. 

The restaurant is small, but always worth the wait!!!! Everytime we are going to pass through montecito on our way to SB we stop here! Service is always great too!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Probably the best sushi I've ever had in my life. Highly recommend.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,Horrible service.  Insulting staff.  I've never felt compelled to write a review until this experience.  Avoid this place!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Meh. I can't understand the positive reviews for this establishment.

The plating of specialty rolls was colorful and exciting to the eye, but the flavor was always lackluster. For instance, we ordered the ""Albacore Habanero Melt"" for spicy lovers, but we're confused when we ate it because there was no kick to it at all. The toro we ordered was a bit fishy, and the uni appetizer we tried was skippable. 

This might be a good place for people who enjoy lots of mayonnaise, pesto, beet sauce, or cooked fish on sushi rolls, but it is not the place for me."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Best Sushi in Santa Barbara. My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary dinners!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Ordered about $300 worth of sushi from here and I kid you not when I say none of it was edible. The fish smelled bad, the rice was so thick and gross, just really bad sushi place overall. Santa Barbara doesn't have great sushi in general but this was rough."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"We arrived at 5:30 & were told it would be about 20-30 minutes.  Went for a walk & came back & we were once again told it would be at least another 30 minutes.  Waited in front & saw customers leave but no wait staff making any attempt to clear the tables.  What we did see was a procession of customers come in & get to-go food.  The front desk person needs to be honest with her time assessments because we left & 20 minutes later we got a call that our table was ready.  Really bad service.  Moral of the story, if you expect to eat at this place order to go food cuz you won't be seated any time soon"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"We had very high hopes for this restaurant based on all the reviews we read on yelp and google. What we actually should have paid attention to was the few negative reviews. Sakana feels like they are pricing their menu in a way that solely capitalizes on the extremely pricey area of Montecito they are located in, not the quality of food they are serving.

The first problem was when we ordered the sake. They have 2 prices, for large or small. Common sense would make you believe you're actually ordering a large or small actual bottle of sake. Generally that's 300 ml or 720 ml bottles. However, this restaurant takes a large bottle and pours it into their little carafes and CALLS it a large bottle. Very deceptive and disappointing and the tiny carafe of sake we got which was smaller than a 12 ounce bottle of beer was NOT worth $24. After asking the server she said their small bottle would get you about 3 shots. I'm guessing that's if you're lucky, based on the size of the ""large"" bottle they served. 

We ordered the garlic edamame without checking the price and that was my bad, because if I had seen it was $9 we would have passed. The edamame portion was small, and some were warm, most were cold. Not consistent and nothing special. 

The specialty roll (lobster melt) for $20 was 5 pieces, and signature press box (habanero yellowtail melt) for $19.5 was also pretty small. Both were pretty tasty I'll give them that - but the portions were severely lacking. We ordered a regular salmon roll to try to get a little more filled up but really wish we didn't because it was terrible. Think very sub par to grocery store sushi. It felt like that roll was just an afterthought slapped together.

I have to say, maybe we are spoiled with excellent sushi where we live in San Diego and so the reviews for this place are based on just not having any good sushi options in the area, but for a $120+ dinner that whole meal was really worth half the price if being generous."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is my favorite sushi place in SB...even better than Arigato. the fish is always SO fresh. the menu is extensive and offers so many creative and delicious options. i've never been disappointed with anything i've ever ordered there. it is a very tiny space, however, so be sure to get there relatively early or you'll have to wait outside for a while, however it's worth it."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Amazing food!..ok atmosphere but the rolls never disappoint. Also consistent service. Love this place
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Went right after the opening of dine in for restaurants and they were clearly understaffed. Brindi (her name was on the receipt) was very busy but still went above and beyond to ensure we were happy. The food was delicious (got the green tea scallop, lobster melt, and the pink roll) and the customer service was outstanding by her. This girl needs a raise! She looked like she was almost running the whole front of house by herself. Over all a wonderful experience and will be back again."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"When I was 18 years old, I worked next to a fish market on Patterson. The owner would slice up fresh still-flipping sashimi for me often. One day he told me ""go to Ichiban and ask for Nao. Sit in front of him, tell him you know me, and tell him to just feed you."" 

So, I took him up, and proceeded to be serenaded in passionate culinary depth in a way I had never experienced. Each idea, each dish was unique to Nao, passionate, authentically loved by him. And the result was utter glee. 

I followed Nao to Piranha and would sit in front of him on off nights when he could really perform. Usually the entire restaurant would go wide-eyed as they saw the brilliant creations he would improvise. Being that I am both a chef and a jazz drummer, I have to say this was a huge influence. I will say without a second thought, Nao inspired me to be a chef. His understanding of color, smell, texture, flavor is nothing less then a language with which he can weave poetic culinary zen grace. 

Sakana is Nao's well-deserved restaurant. I am grateful for his influence, and that he has a place to express his culinary voice with distinction.

wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Very good sushi, great special rolls, amazing sauce. The restaurant is small but charming and has a SoCal beachy casual vibe, the service is usually great but when they get busy it becomes a little uncomfortable in there. Go early or go late for a good seat, try the yellowtail habanero press box!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This place was DELICIOUS! 
We got here a little in the later side of things but they served us and did no rush us at all! The server, forgot her name, was very helpful and her recommendations were what made our sushi date SPECTACULAR. 
I implore you to try the basil fluke, halibut dish the server said was the most popular. We also had the sashimi seared ahi tuna. I ate every single piece of that off. I refuse to share! Cannot wait to come back. Santa Barbara staple for sure!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is a specialty sushi place and the specialty sushi is excellent.  It is not a place for traditional or perhaps ""authentic"" sushi, but if you like sushi and like a little creativity with your rolls, this place is for you. 

Not only is the fish quality great, but the combinations they offer for specialty sushi are very inspired. Most prominent on the menu are the ""press box"" items. It was explained to me that the ""press box"" items are essentially rolls constructed with a technique that keeps the ingredients together without the seaweed. To me, I understood this to be an accommodation to a population who doesn't prefer seaweed. It could also be that seaweed might prevent some of their flash frying and ""torching"" (applying the fire from a hand torch), which were common methods of preparation on many of the menu items. 

That was another aspect of the menu that intrigued me--that many of the rolls and items were either flash fried, seared, or torched. I haven't been to a sushi place where so many of the items strayed away from strict presentation of fresh raw fish. This isn't to say that they weren't using fresh fish or anything of the sort (it all tasted amazing to me), but perhaps it does reflect how Sakana seeks to be different. Perhaps it has in mind to accommodate a less tolerant American palate. Whatever the case, the torching was a fun sight to see, adding some entertainment for those of seated at the bar, where they showcase the torching of the tops of nearly complete rolls above the dividing wall.

We ordered the habanero yellowtail melt press box, the half and half (salmon & tuna), and the garlic albacore. We also ordered the seared wagyu beef wrapped around enoki mushrooms for an appetizer. 

The habenero yellowtail melt press box was incredible. It was undoubtedly the highlight of a fantastic meal for me. The roll comes with a variety of sauces on the plate for you to dip and enjoy, as well as traditional mainstays pickled ginger and wasabi. The dipping sauces were interesting, but the cut pieces were incredible by themselves. Every bite was a tantalizing experience, and when we had eaten all of the roll, the disappointment of a finished meal set in. We didn't want it to end! We wished we had ordered more specialty sushi press boxes. 

The garlic albacore was very smooth and buttery as well. My wife enjoyed it a little more than I, but it was still delicious. Because they have a large menu of really interesting specialty sushi, I don't know if I would order it again. Same goes for the half and half (salmon and tuna). Although delicious and a little more typical of a sushi experience, I would like to explore more of the specialty sushi on a return visit.

Another highlight of the meal was the appetizer--the seared wagyu wrapped around enoki mushrooms. The beef was incredibly tender and flavorful. Having never had wagyu (or kobe), I had high expectations that were unmistakably met. It was a wonderful introduction to our meal and to a highly satisfying experience.

Sakana is a wonderful sushi restaurant with wonderfully inspired sushi and presentation. It was well worth the visit."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,This used to be my favorite sushi place untill COVID-19. Super sad. They barely give you any fish with the sushi now. The service has gotten really bad. $26 for a sushi roll that barley has fish on it I sent it back. Won't ever come here again. Big waste of money.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"The non-traditional rolls at this place are AMAZING!  They are not what you would expect or find at any other sushi place.  They are really creative with the flavors and and presentation; the sushi is absolutely yummy.  The restaurant is very small, we waited 30 minutes on a Wednesday night to get seated.  They served me a sake cocktail while I waited that delish, but light on the alcohol.  Otherwise, I LOVE that the tables are small and that they pace the meal absolutely perfectly.  You won't get all your rolls at once and your tiny table will never feel crowded.  I was just as impressed with the service as I was with the food.  The prices are not unreasonable compared to most sushi places, definitely more pricey but not by much.  You should simply try this place because you will not find these kinds of rolls anywhere else (I don't think).  The menu is very, very extensive... to the point of being overwhelming.  We just ordered everything the waitress suggested without regrets."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Taste is an amazing wonderful thing and I always pause when I seem to be bucking a trend.  Finally tried Sakana by prying myself from one of my top three favorite sushi places in the world, Arigato.  I will just say Sakana was not good for my wife and I.  Innovation is a key ingredient in the ever evolving world of culinary delights, but balsamic vinegar in sushi rice is very much not for me.  I can overlook the off-putting color tone of the rice, but the mush factor is frankly unforgivable.  Not sure if that's the balsamic or the prep.  Either way it just was not good.  So shifted to sashimi and honestly thumbnail size pieces of ankimo just isn't right and without the usual accompaniments makes it a disaster.  Then there's scallop sashimi which was three whole, unsliced, unseasoned and unadorned blobs on a plate.  So Sorry Sakana and Sakana lovers if I'm just out of touch."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I stopped in one very busy Friday evening and luckily got a spot at the sushi bar.  The service was great and the sushi chef really friendly.  A fairly extensive sake menu as well.  After reading the dizzying array of menu choices - they serve everything with 3 kinds of sauces, I finally ordered a scallop and a yellowtail sashimi, and squid stuffed with spicy tuna.  While everything was tasty, I have to say that the sauces really took away from the fresh flavors of the seafood itself.  There was just too much chipotle and jalapeno flavors trying to pass itself off in japanese cuisine.  I love peppers, but the thing I like most about japanese food is the simplicity of the flavors.  The chef agreed that one would find more traditional restaurants in Japan.  I like the choices, but I may just stick with traditional sashimi next time I visit."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I'm salivating like a rabid dog thinking about the Haberno Yellowtail Melt. I also ordered the Salmon Island Style Roll and the Mango Curry Sushi, and those were to die for as well. And the garlic edamame = crack. Each dish was so fresh, so saucy, so mouthwateringly delectable. 

I live in SF and am going to cry myself to sleep every night knowing that Sakana --  the best sushi place in the world -- is a treacherous 5 hour drive away."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,This place it's great ! The food was amazing you have to wait a little to be seat ! But it worth it!!!! I'm so happy to find this place I'm totally recommend you ! Esta perfecto para una cita y la comida es tan buena que vas a querer regresar ! ME ENCANTO!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"A word for my fellow vegans. I know we'd usually steer clear of a place that boasts of 4 pages of menu mostly containing fish and meat. I nearly did too. Except, that I was with a group of friends and had to go to this place. I was quite happy with the end result. I managed to be in a corner and the waitress was v attentive to making sure I had my order in while the rest of the table got their meat and fish game going. 
I got the seared Japanese eggplant, and shishito peppers for appetizers, and the mediterranean roll for the mains. They were all v good and fresh, the Mediterranean rolls were innovative. There were a handful other vegan options that I was considering, but this was more than enough food for me. The presentation of the meat and the fish dishes for the rest of the table looked grander, and more well thought of- they must not get many veggie/vegan orders perhaps! I'd come back here for the vegan options, there are many others I didn't try."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Yep, still the bomb. Every time we come to Santa Barbara getting Sakana is a MUST. Surfer & montecito box rolls are my go tos, my husband always also gets the seared albacore and toro box.
I read recent reviews about how they've gone down hill recently and was nervous... but happy to report from our dinner tonight that everything is amazing as usual."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,Terrible sushi quality. I ordered salmon and it had a bad odor. The fish wasn't fresh at all and it was plated by someone who doesn't know how to prepare sushi correctly. With all the positive reviews I got excited to try the place out and was extremely disappointed. I have two stars instead of one only because the atmosphere was not bad.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Solid sushi dinner. The salmon ceviche and the jalapeño octopus sashimi were our favorite items. Good outdoor seating set up with a lot of heaters. You definitely won't get cold sitting outside here.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Beautiful, yummy, yellow tail sashimi served on ice, amazing! Best sushi in santa barbara."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This was not my first time to Sakana, so I don't know why I haven't bothered to comment before, but the wife and I had dinner there tonight for the second time this week and I just felt compelled.  While not the best sushi we've tried (I think Bond Street in NY takes that cake), it is definitely the best sushi in Santa Barbara.  Yes they do use a lot of sauces, but they are oh so good and different than you'll find anywhere else.  The Habanero Yellowtail Press Box roll, the Aburri Scallop, and the toro are our favorites.  It is pricey and the place is small so the wait can be quite long if you don't get there early, but the food is worth the wait. Oh and Marcos, the busser, is absolutely fantastic - more attentive than the waitresses."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Definitely not your traditional sushi, Sakana offers an intriguing and overwhelming selection of unique fusion rolls, press-boxes (like sushi rolls, but stacked instead of rolled), sushi, and sashimi. 

Although they offer more traditional fare (which I'm sure is delicious), as a first-time patron, I decided to explore some of their more original options. With some guidance from our knowledgeable waitress, I decided on the salmon burrata press box and the basil fluke sushi. The salmon press box was a delight, both with the colorful array of sauces provided and with simple soy sauce. The basil flavor on the fluke was well-represented - I've never had a sushi combo like that.

Overall, it was a fun experience trying out a new flavor palate. Try to get there around the time they open-- they don't take reservations and the place fills up fast!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"The hostess didn't like my request for seating. I stayed where she asked. She went to the very tiny hallway and told the waitress how ridiculous I was, laughed about me as I walked by, then they both pretty much ignored us the rest of the night because I caught her insulting me. The plate was 12 pieces of fish for $60 freaking dollars. It's a farce. The hostess is horrid. Don't bother. I'll NEVER come here again. You shouldn't either."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Had dinner here last night and I can't stop raving about it. The food was delicious!

We ordered the musketeer oysters which are fresh oysters topped with uni, caviar and chives in a ponzu sauce. These oysters were the star of the show.

The m.s.c, these were fresh scallops topped with monkfish pate and caviar. Never had anything like it, it was mouthwatering.

The seared salmon sashimi, this came with capers, dill and caviar. Also savory and tasty, wish we got another order in before last call! 

A couple orders of the uni nigiri and salmon nigiri. Excellent quality sushi, the uni was buttery and salmon was fresh.

I seriously can not wait to plan another trip here just for this restaurant. The food was astounding and service was also phenomenal. Our server had great recommendations and did not disappoint!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Not even sure there is a better place to get sushi...anywhere!  

Sit at the bar!!!!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"We have had mixed experiences in this restaurant in the past, but we came expecting good sushi. We were very disappointed. Starting from the tea (tasteless as hot water), to the toro (fibrous), to the beef carpaccio (the opposite of tender and soft) we had a very unpleasant dinner experience. We are not going back any time soon."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I don't see the magic about this place. It's good but not so good you can't have the same experience elsewhere. It's pricey and the seating arrangement is awkward because you are literally sitting with the people next to you...

Sushi is good, I can taste the freshness. Service is a little sour at lunch but I don't think that would be an issue at other times, lunch is pretty demanding. They have a big TV over the sushi bar that just displays a fish loop video. I get the general idea but I kinda wish there was a game on instead."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"C'mon people, this is not sushi!  I don't know what you call it but it is not even good fusion. 

I thought, what the hell , I'll go for the most popular roll...it was awful.  Tried a few pieces of nigiri, awful as well. 

I was in SB and I see ocean all around me...hard to believe there are zero good sushi bars to be found.  

Could someone let me know if there is any REAL sushi in SB...

Sushi imposter"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Favorite sushi spot in town! Order the habanero yellow tail melt! You won't be disappointed!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Amazing spot but the highlight was the waitress. The customer service from Sophie was outstanding. Will definitely return and highly recommend around.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Absolutely amazing. Their specialty sushi menu is not only incredibly diverse, but every thing we have ever tried has been truly delicious. Probably the best sushi at this cost on the west coast, and maybe the best sushi at any cost. The regular sushi leaves a little to be desired so we recommend sticking To their specialty menu. But we were delightfully surprised by this Santa Barbara gem"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Absolutely the best sushi I've ever had. I'm a travel blogger and have enjoyed sushi around the world at establishments of varying luxury and the creativity and flavors at Sakana simply can't be beat. They offer all the same basic rolls and nigiri as any traditional sushi restaurant, but then go above and beyond with their specialty elements. They craft the most unique menu items with exquisite execution. This is a place everyone needs to enjoy at least once in their lifetime."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"My girlfriend and I are doing a ""sushi journey"" by trying every sushi place we can within 50 miles of Santa Barbara. So far we've been to all but three sushi places (that we know of), and both agree that Sakana is the best. We didn't really know of this spot from any of our friends' recommendations and found it by chance through yelp. We've been here twice - their menu isn't very traditional, but they have some interesting items and everything was really fresh! May not be for everyone, but I would recommend people to check this place out."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"In my top two of sushi bars in the Santa Barbara area, Sakana is one of a kind. Small, packed and no hold barred sushi is all about the presentation at Sakana. 
Forget reservations as  they're not taken. So get in early and be ready to wait at this hidden gem of Santa Barbara/Montecito. Finding it is the first task but once you're there, only your pocket book will drive you away. Expensive, even for sushi, Sakana chefs create works of art on a plate. A normal sized hand roll may be on a plate 24""x12"" to allow a palette to draw on with creams and sauces, roe and ginger.
Spare change is collected in our house in a jar called the Sakana Fund. When it's full, we go and love every bite. See you soon!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Food was good and service was good but this is the smallest sushi restaurant I've ever been to in my life. The tables are too close to one another. I was kind of uncomfortable eating here. I've even lived in NYC and the tables were not so close to each other. I won't be back here for this reason. 
Sorry"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Wow! (I feel like that one word should just be enough lol). I have tried hundreds of sushi spots and this is hands down my top 2! They have outdoor seating which is a great way to feel comfortable during a pandemic. The service is absolutely amazing and the servers are really sweet. The sushi also comes out quickly. Came here with a big group and everything still came out quickly and done perfectly. The prices are a little higher than average sushi spot, but it reflects the quality of the sushi and that's definitely justifiable. This place has some of the freshest sushi I have ever had. Highly recommend this place and will definitely be returning!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Extremity disappointed, not well presented nor the taste just $$$ Montecito price! If you want good sushi go to Arigato in Santa Barbara state street. If you throw sushi in garbage you know how bad it is!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"What can I say... Sakana ruined sushi for me, for the best. I can't eat sushi anywhere else. The rice and fish combination melts in your mouth and don't get me started on the presentation of their dishes. 10000/10 must try when in Santa Barbara. Chef's kiss."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Cute little sushi spot in Montecito. Fish tastes fresh and they offer a variety of unique items and special rolls
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Most unique sushi I've ever had! I cannot stop dreaming about their pressed-box sushi, ugh. It's to die for.

Their rolls are a bit more pricey, around $18 each. But with such unique flavors, techniques, and ingredients, it is very worth it.

I wish I could come here more often but it is really out of the way. I will come back for you one day, Sakana."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Tiny spot with folks hanging out front waiting, but in only ten minutes we had a table. Very good sushi. We enjoyed the yellowtail and uni + salmon roe rolls. Great sake selection."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in the SB area.  The sushi is great and the presentation is a work of art. Try the Basil Fluke... You won't regret it! Press Boxes are awesome as well.  Enjoy!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"No wait at lunch! and full access to dinner as well as lunch menu. Special rolls provide a mouthful unison of spicy, sweet, savory, crunchy and sushi freshness! The inventive Rolls are about $5 more per than other above average sushi places in similar locales and worth it! White and Sake decor, very  limited seating makes one feel special!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Oh my god. I love this place. I asked for the chef's choice and noted I was pretty hungry. I was brought the most spectacular plate of sushi. I love Japanese food and have traveled in Japan but this just might be my first choice of any Japanese restaurant I've been to.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Sakana is small high end sushi place located in Montecito, the land of million dollar houses.  The decor is minimalistic and pristine white which becomes a canvas for the extravagant rolls beautifully decorated in a plethora of colorful sauces.  The seafood used was high quality and very fresh, and of course the high price tag reflected that.  I am glad I went and I was kicking myself for not bringing my camera.  Overall, I prefer Ahi or Arigato over Sakana because the latter went overboard with flavor combinations, therefore, was not as successful in introduce nontraditional flavors to sushi.  The same half a dozen sauces range from chocolate to red to orange to yellow to green were liberally applied to every plate like a Jackson Pollock painting.  It was just too much and overshadowed the delicate flavor of the seafood."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"What a gem and little find tucked back at end of the strip mall (near the Vons)..next to Blenders and SBX.  

Excellent diverse menu.  Great to have a Japanese place that really offers more than sushi and miso soup.   Our Japanese friends and LA based were pleasantly surprised too.   Gets busy and when busy...it is noisy but well worth it!

Ambiance is fun there too."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Hands down the best sushi in Santa Barbara. Everytime I'm back from San Fran I come craving this place!! So much variety and such amazing service too!  

My favs 
STARTERS: - my fav has to be the Soicy sesame octopus salad!! Comes with seaweed and cucumber salad with bits of octopus thrown in there! Perfect to start the meal. 
ENTREES : - MUST GET the Chilean sea bass entry. It really just melts in your mouth with such incredible flavors. This is a staple every time i come. 
SUSHI : - I've tried a lot of the sushi offered here, and the list is extensive so I'm not even halfway through all the options but my favs have to be ..
- merry go round : comes with scallop, yellowtail and tuna on top and the combo of those 3 fishes is really good ! 
- white dragon : doesn't come with rice, so it's a lighter sushi and I feel like you're able to taste the fish better
- Basil fluke : whether you get the basil fluke sashimi/ nigiri or the press box you REALLY can't go wrong. This is hands down the best combo I've ever had 

Honestly all the sushi offered here is amazing! Really looking at the menu and dissecting what you personally like is fun, and I promise anything you choose will be delicious and have you craving for more"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Had dinner here with my daughters and friends last weekend while visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend they pick the restaurant based on the yelp rating and when we went there at first we were surprised how small the place was but then it was packed and even though we had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes it was well worth it. The food was great and everything we ordered was delicious. We ordered five different roles to try them all and every single one of them were fantastic. The misso soup was Speary flavorful which for me that is an indication that the sushi restaurant is good because not every sushi restaurant gets the miso soup right. I'm glad we found this place, and it is going to be on my list every time I visit Santa Barbara in the future. I shouldn't also forget to mention the service was very friendly and timely and first overall we had a great experience and I highly recommend the restaurant."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Love this place!  Great for special occasions. The place is very tiny, intimate, a bit romantic with roses on each table.  The sushi itself is awesome.  I would warn that it is a bit experimental, with unique sauces and frying techniques, so if you're looking for very traditional you might be disappointed.  However, if you're looking for some new sushi flavors, definitely give this place a try.  Great sake as well.  Warning- gets crowded easily, doesn't take reservations, and can be a 45+ minute wait."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I am from a tropical island called Guam and our close proximity to Japan allows for great influence in the Japanese cuisine. With that being said, Sakana has grade-A ingredients, and provides a superb twist on fusion sushi as well as keeping it traditional with their traditional sushi items. This place gets my full support and leaves me craving it anytime I want sushi."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"The sushi was decent but expensive.  We ordered a large bottle is Sake and were brought a small in-house glass.  We also ordered edamame , some of which was warm and some cold.  We were hoping once the sushi arrived that would change things but unfortunately we received very little sushi for the cost.  Maybe they can charge these prices for the portions because they're in Montecito.  My sense, not worth it."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Best sushi I've ever had! It is so nice that Montecito area has a sushi spot and it happens to be the best sushi spot. Does get crowded so be prepared to wait in some sort of line and it is small but it is worth it. The waitress is very nice and the food is delicious.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Some of the best sushi in sb. Great fish quality and sauces.

I personally like Arigato a bit more but sakanna is a close second.  Make sure you don't go during peak hours as the line can be very long."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Not an expert, but definitely the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to, period. A little pricey but worth every penny. Have been disappointed in the past by expensive but supposedly amazing sushi spots (Nobu), yet Sakana doesn't disappoint. Press boxes are the way to go, unique flavor combinations and quite possibly the best things I have ever tasted."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Place is postage stamp tiny, about 15 tables and a bar crammed in about 500 sq ft.  The size of the menu has the cheese cake factory looking over their shoulder.

They lack no spirits outside of sake, cocktails included.

To make this simple, everything on the menu is done well, I mean everything. Which is incredible.  Not one dish, app or entree sucked.

Service is a plus as well. I say come and come often."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,Since Covid the food and the service has been terrible and the last time I ate there I got diarrhea.  Place looked dirty and I watched a guy rub his nose and continue making sushi. Gross.  Get back to the way you were before Covid people.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"No wait at lunch! and full access to dinner as well as lunch menu. Special rolls provide a mouthful unison of spicy, sweet, savory, crunchy and sushi freshness! The inventive Rolls are about $5 more per than other above average sushi places in similar locales and worth it! White and Sake decor, very  limited seating makes one feel special! 
Wrapping could have been tighter on most rolls. Service and food was freaky quick and super friendly!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Go to for sushi date nights or special occasions because it's a little pricey. And always get the big saki, not the small, who are we kidding."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Usually I'm not a fan of places that have gigantic menus with pages and pages of sushi rolls dressed in sauces. But being heralded as the ""best sushi in Santa Barbara"", I had to give it a shot. 

The quality of the fish here is very good as expected, and they had wild white salmon, which is pretty difficult to come by. The sashimi plates that are lightly blowtorched are quite tasty, especially the yellowtail belly - delicious! 

The rolls... were fine. Lots of sauce, it's not really my thing, but they were ok. The selection was staggering.  

Overall, this is a great little spot - I'll be back for sure"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,Cute sushi spot in a strip mall in SB. Their sweet shrimp was delicious. Service was great and the girl was very attentive. Would definitely recommend!
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Very good sushi, great special rolls, amazing sauce. The restaurant is small but charming and has a SoCal beachy casual vibe, the service is usually great but when they get busy it becomes a little uncomfortable in there. Go early or go late for a good seat, try the yellowtail habanero press box!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Sakana is not a so new sushi restaurant but everyone seems to be buzzing about it lately. The decor of the restaurant is minimalist and clean. It's quite a loud place after Seven, I had to shout at my waitress a couple of times until she understood what I wanted to order. 

Parking was horrendous. It seems like I always have a hard time finding a parking space no matter what time of the day it is. 

THE STAFF - 

They always have new servers every time I go here, so service is usually a hit or a miss, but on my recent adventure here, my server seemed to be very busy having a laugh with one of the other diners here, and whenever I would ask for my cold green tea, it wouldn't come.  

THE FOOD - 

Supposedly Sakana has the best Sake selection in the neighboring cities. So I had to order one.  The menu is pretty tough though, there is a lot to choose from which gives me a chance to keep visiting this restaurant. 

Sakana uses really big portions on their sushi so if you're here alone or on a date, it might be best to just share plates. What was really unique about Sakana that most Japanese Restaurants don't do is mix their white and brown rice together. I loved that.

The meal was memorable not only because of the quality of sushi, but because of the ambiance, setting and extensive elaborate artistry designs of sauces of the plating dishes."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Just one of our favorite Japanese restaurants outside of Japan. Outstanding. Creative. A real pleasure. Love the Montecito press box, especially!!!!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Another beautiful night in Montecito, and a warm and cozy setting sitting outside at Sakana. And the timing was perfect as we arrived for dinner and were able to get seated promptly. Thank you to Marco for keeping the area ready for guests, and for also keeping the space heaters cranked up for our comfort. He was very attentive to us all as we settled in for this Sushi Adventure.

As we were seated and going through the extensive menu, our server Brindi started our evening off with answers to all of our Sushi questions, and made some helpful suggestions.

Brindi explained the concept of the Press Box Roll . . . and we were sold. Our favorites being the Crispy Rice and Spicy Tuna (with crispy Fillo), and the Mozzarella Red Wine Eel Melt, which at first sounded too over the top for us, and turned out to be incredibly delicious. Yes, we were skeptical at first, but the sound of rock shrimp tempura, spicy basil crab, red wine eel, mozzarella, truffle red wine sauce, and tempura basil leaf all together as one was too hard to pass up. 

With all this delicious Sushi we decided for a bottle of their French Rose, and it was a perfect pairing with our meal. They also have a very good selection of Sake, beer and other wines as well."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,The toro press box is amazing! Would highly recommend. The staff is very helpful with navigating the menu and suggesting other rolls too.
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"This is probably the best sushi I have ever had even including sushi in Japan. The fish is fresh, the menu is varied, and there are items on the menu that anyone could enjoy. Try out the Nigiri, the Maguro, Ebi, Unagi, and Tamago Nigiri are excellent. Arrive early, since seating is highly limited and reservations are not accepted. Arrive at 6pm if you want to eat before 7, you won't get a seat from 6:45 to 8pm."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Came here once about five years ago and was passing through the area and decided to revisit. The miso is very good, and the sushi was just as excellent as we remembered. The rolls are bright and innovative, with beautiful presentation. We left very full and happy, with lighter wallets."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Let me start by saying we are Montecito locals have been to Sanaka numerous times and have had decent food and ok service, nothing fantastic but we like the fact that it is so close to our house. But our last experience was the last time we will go back as they refused to seat us even though tables were open. We visited their location on a Friday night at  6:00pm an expected a wait given the new outdoor seating and well, it's Friday night. We were surprised that they had two tables open, one 4 top and one with one chair because if you put a chair on the other side it would be in the middle of the front door with employees going in and out. We asked to be seated on the 4 top as we saw other couples sitting at 4 tops next to the open table and they refused and they tried to seat us at the table for one. Two people at a table for one wasn't going to work. When we asked why the other couples could sit at 4 tops and we couldn't all we just got back was blank stares. I am guessing they were wanting to hold the table hoping that a larger group would show but it was pretty dead on this particular Friday night. We love to support our local businesses, especially restaurants during Covid-19, but when they won't seat you even though tables are open is really bad judgment and bad service. Unfortunately we won't be going back."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Best sushi of my life.  My wife is a ""sushi snob"" and couldn't get enough of this place. This is not a less is more kind of place. At Sakana, more is more! Of course they do off very traditional dishes as well.  Great atmosphere and decent wait time.  Can't wait to come back!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"You lied about your Sunday hours which made me sad because my friend and I showed up at your restaurant and you were closed. Thanks for ruining sushi dreams today, though I still give you five stars because I love your sushi."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"Such a great little sushi bar!

I found this place on Yelp and my husband and I decided to give it a try last Friday evening. It looked like it gets busy, but luckily we were hungry early. They don't take reservations: it's first-come, first-served, and the entire party has to be present to be seated. There are some tables on a raised dining area and probably 8-10 seats at the sushi bar.

We were seated on the bar right away with the menu, which is substantial. They have a bunch of appetizers, some classic nigiri, lots of specials, and tons of rolls of their own creation. It's not super traditional and they seem to capitalise on rolls. But if you know exactly what you like, there are lots of options for nigiri and sashimi, and if you do want something simple they cater to that, too. They also have a great beer and wine selection and tons of imported sake to choose from.

First off, the miso soup is excellent. You get a generous serving, and it was very flavorful and well-balanced. My husband and I tend to order the same nigiri most places we go, so we got a couple of the standard nigiri fish options and the specials board. We were seated right by the head sushi chef, who checked in frequently without rushing us and took our sushi orders. I heard the waitstaff checking in with him about special requests throughout the meal and they definitely take their work seriously.

The standard salmon was very good, as was the Canadian albacore. The Japanese Kampachi Yellowtail was delicious, super buttery. I liked the glaze on the rice too, it was subtle enough not to detract from the fish and helped everything come together. (My pet peeve is dry rice!) My personal highlight of the meal was the MSC sushi - monkfish pate, Japanese scallop, caviar, sea urchin sauce. It looked like a work of art. Super rich, super buttery, absolutely delicious.

Nice space, good ambiance, solid service, and excellent sushi. Recommended!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Those who have dined with me at sushi bars know that I dislike sushi rolls intensely. Those who have not are about to learn.

At omakase meals in Japan, or at proper sushi bars here in the U.S., sushi rolls are served at the very end of a meal as a means of ensuring the customer is full, and as a ""f*ck you"" from an exasperated chef who has fed you like Shamu for 2 hours, unloading all of his premium A+ stuff on you, even as you broke several of the many unwritten sushi chopstick rules.

Perhaps I exaggerate a tad, but so does everyone on Yelp.

Bottom line is that sushi bars that specialize in rolls can't be trusted and are often presided over by lackluster hacks who do not possess the skill to make the precise cuts required of sashimi and nigiri. After all, it is much easier to wrap 3 different types of seafood with avocado, imitation crab, sesame seeds, ""spicy sauce,"" Worcestershire sauce, orange Cheetos dust, and Frosted Flakes. (Throw some ketchup in it too, because our American tastes are subhuman.)

For this reason, Sakana is very much the opposite of what I typically look for in a sushi bar. It is here that traditional sushi like sashimi and nigiri take a backseat to expensive rolls that combine multiple types of fish. Western concoctions like ""sriracha cream cheese"", ""truffle soy sauce"", and ""habanero pepper aioli"" find themselves on nearly EVERY dish, either painted on the plate in squiggly lines or as a fluorescent goo ominously drenching the food like the slime from ""You Can't Do That on Television.""

Beyond its incomprehensible culture-bending culinary point-of-view, Sakana is a trendy Instagram-darling of a restaurant situated in one of the most posh communities in the country, unapologetically catering its menu and prices towards trust-funders and (occasionally) their truly rich benefactors. This place violates so many of my sensibilities that I should challenge its owner to a Hamilton-style duel. And YET, I gotta be honest, Sakana kinda almost works for me.

Their ""Habanero Yellowtail Melt Press Box"" was perhaps the richest sushi dish I've ever eaten. What Sakana calls a ""press box"" is essentially a roll shaped inside a box without a seaweed wrapper. Call it whatever you want, but a circumcised sushi roll is still a sushi roll. Spicy as it was, this roll featured a bunch of different seafood, and both a habanero sauce and a truffle soy sauce, but it was surprisingly pleasing - both in terms of taste and in terms of its dramatic presentation, which resembled the type of high food art I'd expect at a Joël Robuchon outpost; it was shiny and colorful and wild, like a row of drum majorettes. It was as luxurious and caloric of a sushi splurge as I could imagine, and I could only imagine having this kind of dish in two places: Vegas or here in Montecito. But let's also be clear -- despite its merits, I'd not call this sushi, as I couldn't really discern any seafood under all of the sauces.

The ""Garlic Albacore Kawari Sashimi"" was closer to sushi, boasting a plate with seared albacore topped with garlic chips, chives, roasted ginger, dijon crab, and truffle soy sauce. The sinfully rich dijon crab-infused truffle sauce stole the show. 

What else didn't work for me? The nigiri I ordered had rice that was too tightly-packed, and the uni was not great despite being in Santa Barbara. Better than I'd get in most places, but I expect it to be transcendent in this region. Most detrimentally, everything was super expensive.

Attempting to come to a conclusion about this place, I am faced with a dilemma: despite not conforming to my sushi preferences, the food here is quite good and the interaction with my chef at the sushi bar was friendly, informative, and professional - but there are just too many things about Sakana that turn me off for me to recommend it. For an area with other worthy Japanese dining alternatives (such as the outstanding Yoichi's in downtown Santa Barbara), I believe one must really LOVE rolls for this restaurant to be a priority.

wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Great food but bad communication and poor ordering policy. I called a day ahead of New Years Eve to place a very large ($200+) order and was told they do not take orders a day ahead. Ok that's fine. I asked what time was the earliest on New Years Eve I could call in my order and was told do not call in any earlier than placing any order. Odd, right. So I call 15 times in 30 minutes and got busy signals every time. Ok, fine. It's New Years Eve. So I go and place an order in person at 6:15 pm and the place is practically half full. So maybe they are swamped with take out orders, I think. I was told it will be ready in an hour and they ask for my phone number, not ""we will call you when it's ready."" So, I get a phone call an hour after I place my order to tell me they are out of two types of fish I ordered. Ok, fine. So I drive over 90 minutes after I place my order and am told It's not ready. The place is 100 percent empty. 1 hour and 45 minutes later, they call and say it's ready."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"I went here almost a week ago on a Friday evening with two other people. The restaurant itself was relatively busy and has a nice atmosphere with the colored lights. 

The service was not great, however it was late in the evening and we had ordered many things so we let it pass when the waitress forgot two oyster shooters, an eel and avocado roll, and one other roll our table had ordered. 

The rolls themselves were okay, not my favorite, but then I tend to prefer traditional sushi myself. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was probably my favorite item I tried. Although I thought there was a bit too much cucumber in the seaweed salads, my girlfriend and I thought it was a cute touch that they were served in martini glasses. 


Overall the dining experience was pretty average. 


I'm giving one star for the fact that I the uni I ordered and ate alone at my table gave me FOOD POISONING for the first time in my life and I'm not sure I've ever puked so hard."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"After reading all of the positive reviews, we decided to make Sakana our first dining experience in SB.  We arrived around 6:45pm on a Friday eve to a small crowd waiting outside. We put our names on the list and were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait.  We feel like the wait was closer to 30-35 min, still not quite as long as I was expecting to wait. 

We ordered:

Short ribs - tough but tasty
Soft shell crab - heavier and oilier but crunchier than accustomed to. 
Yellowtail habanero- delicious
Red Wine Unagi - okay, nothing special
Kobi beef sashimi - okay, not a lot of flavor
Garlic albacore sashimi - good. We ate it. Ordered it again and the 2nd order was not quite as good. 

All and all it was a okay. Neither one of us was blown away by anything that we ordered.  Would we return?  Most likely. Not on this trip however way to many other places to get our get our pacman on in a new city with tons of yummy eats to discover."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"We'd been hearing a lot about Sakana from our Sushi-loving friends, and finally made to drive to Montecito to experience it for ourselves. Unfortunately they do not take reservations, so we got there nice and early and were able to sit fairly quickly.

And sure enough everything said about this little Sushi restaurant is true. Small intimate space, very friendly servers, and a varied menu of Sushi, Sashimi, rolls, and all paired with an extensive Sake selection.

Our server was very friendly and as we told her what we liked she selected some dishes that we would not have tried, and it made for an evening of new Sushi and Sashimi favorites. Can't wait to go again.

Conveniently located on the West end of Coast Village Road, just beyond the Von's Market, and tucked back at the end of a small strip of stores with Starbuck's on the end, and next to Occhiali Eyewear."

The Press boxes are the way to go but is a tough journey to get there given all the other GREAT things on the menu and the daily specials...

The uni and roe sushi is one of the best I have ever had.

Its a good 45 miles from my house but well worth the drive on the way to a concert or just to hang in this wonderful community."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,Ijust so confused why anyone would go here instead of Arigato. Has been for a few times for lunch including today and it's so overpriced for pretty fresh but boring sushi.  Also the server down right offended me today. Bad bad experience. Literally got cash from Chase yesterday and they wouldn't take my $100 today because apparently I looked suspicious. It just went back to Chase and they said it was ridiculous. Just rude. Good job losing customers

We have had sushi and fresh fish from still kicking tuna on the boat, to hole in the wall all you can eat joints. Sakana is as good as it gets. Freshest fish, crazy good flavors. Sushi fusion at its finest. It's my all time favorite place!"
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,positive,"I generally prefer traditional sushi rather than new-wave.This place has both plus a very tasty selection of sashimi. I had nigiri and sashimi, my friend had maki, and even some veg. selections for my wife. Nice people. It is a bit small so not good for large groups. Besides that, highly recommended."
wFES5bGDiPANW13hNHnXOQ,Sakana Sushi Bar & Japanese,Japanese,negative,"Go to Arigato!!! I would give this restaurant negative stars. Poor, poor poor customer service. We were told 40 minute wait time. We did wait, only to be told we are next multiple times while two top tables where sat in front of us, why they didn't think to combine those tables for our party of 4 is beyond me. After an hour and a half we left. It became comical just to see how long they would have us wait. The food is ok but nothing to write home about. Again, go to Arigato downtown. Better food and way better service."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,Their sushi is pretty good. Mesa rolls are my fav here. They would be 4stars if they gave better estimations for pick ups. It is typical that they lag a lot and they seem to make it after you show up.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Super over-priced. Good sushi but does not stand up to the other dozen or so spots in town, especially when the sashimi is the size of a thumbnail. The dragon roll was excellent but we won't be back."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I am a vegitarian and so finding good veggie rolls that i enjoy is hard, but the guys at icheban know how to do it right! 
I go regularly becasue they know exactly what i like as soon as i get in, and they custom make my order becasue I don't eat fish. The sushi chefs are super funny and and hook it up everytime! 
This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Santa Barbara...

kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Took a long time for me to finally come here due to formerly lack luster reviews. I had a great experience at lunch.  Service was kind and attentive; there were only 1-2 other customers. All 3  rolls were delicious. 

I will say they were notably smaller than other sushi spots. We noticed right away after sharing 3 rolls that we were not bursting with fullness as usual.

Prices were typical. Specialty roll options not as abundant as competitors. Groupon deal was irresistible. Would have no problem returning but a couple other spots would probably be my first choice."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Visiting my daughter at nearby college and she wanted some Japanese food. Yelp review brought us here.  My wife and I ordered Chirashi and it looked okay at first but sashimi slices were a bit thin and rice had very little sushi rice flavor.  Problem was the freshness. Fish didn't have any firmness to it and they smell fishy. My son's salmon wasn't fresh either. My daughter's Unagi Don was okay.  Misoshiru was watery and tasteless. If you like cooked items, lots of mayo, teriyaki sauce and lots of avocados, this is your place.   I would give service 3, overall food 2 and sushi or sashimi 1 star for freshness."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Overview: 5/10 atmosphere, 3/10 service, 7/10 food

I've come here a couple times at off-dinner times (first around 5:00 pm, second time around 8:00 pm) on weekdays. Average looking storefront with the choice of table seating or sushi bar seating. The tables a bit cramped, especially the two person tables, and it isn't a particularly group friendly place. The room is crowded and smaller tables are uncomfortably close to each other. 

Seems like a family business, or at least I hope it is because a few of the waitstaff are downright rude. Every single thing you ask them for--be it water, chopsticks, extra ginger for gods sake--is a huge favor they're imparting to you. Don't even bother waiting for your server to take your food and drink order; call them over unless you want to be there for a couple hours or more, since the food also takes a while to prepare. This would be one thing if it was the best sushi in town, but it most certainly is not. Fish is fresh, but it is at pretty much any other mid-priced sushi restaurant in a 7 mile radius due to the town's location. Both times I've come neither toro nor uni we're on the menu...we're in Santa Barbara! Uni is shipped internationally from this city, you'd think a local restaurant could manage to have some on hand. Their specialty rolls are heavily covered in baked mayonnaise and overly battered and fried. So, go simple the next time, I thought. I ordered a spicy scallop roll, a salmon skin roll, and soft shell crab to split. Spicy scallop roll again had too much mayonnaise, though it was wrapped very well, and the soft shell crab was heavily tempura battered so much that there was more batter than crab. They were out of salmon skin, which would have been OK if they'd told me from the get-go. Instead, they brought my other food out and said they were out of salmon skin. Great, now if I order another dish it will come out later. 

Instead, I'll finish my food and come back never."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I have been there once for dining but I go there all the time for 007 deep spicy sushi. 
I just love it! 
Staff always greet and seems to take care well of their customers."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Great place up on the mesa near lazy acres.  They have really good japanese food and give you a ton for the money.  I used to get takeout here a lot, but it's a good place to eat in as well.  I'm not a sushi guy, but I've been told that theirs is very good!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"One of my lunch meeting spots.  I work out of my home so I need a place to meet clients where we can talk, spend a lot of time and - my preference - that has great food.  Ichiban is one of the best.  Delicious sushi, I can almost always get a table without waiting (at lunch) and, pretty reasonable prices.........."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Great food!!!!! Decent price! Only draw back was soda in a can but not an inconvenience :) or a reason to take away a star.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I used a Groupon for this sushi and i was soooo glad. I really enjoyed the sushi it was super fresh and tasty. When you go try the asparagus and shrimp roll, the caterpillar roll and the spicy mussel roll. You will not be disappointed!

Ohhh yeah cant forget the waitress we had was super sweet and kind!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,It was O.K. The rolls are a little on the smaller side and dry.  It's as expensive as the other sushi joints on state street. All in all it was an average experience.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I'm not so sure why people would give this restaurant anything lower than 4 stars; maybe 3 if they really really wanted to. 
I can understand reading some negative reviews regarding the chef; in reality they weren't too friendly and could easily come off as being rude. But I didn't go there for the chef, I went for the sushi. 

The sushi was excellent.  Fresh for sure. We had Salmon nigiri and several rolls, all of which were delicious. The misso soup hit the spot as an appetizer. The hot green tea had a nice taste, not too intense. 

Overall, this place was great. Once again, I can understand that perhaps the staff wasn't incredibly 100% friendly, but we had an excellent experience today."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"The Star rate would have been 5 because the food ( sushi is delicious) but the rather iffy' treatment made me want to eat and go about my day quickly. We bought a deal through a third party promotion and unfortunately that was not fully honored, but when we asked for our free Edamane when you check in with Yelp they refused. We asked again if they can work the Yelp deal out and they did with an uncomfortable attitude. I'm not a destructive Yelper but It's my first and last time I'll eat at Ichiban. I do however wish them luck."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,California roll was good but pretty pricey. $8 for a take out order of one CA roll and it was packaged like it was from a grocery store.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"My first time here.  Service was good, and the sushi was good quality.  But I'm giving it three stars because of the Wasabi.  It was terrible.  Not spicy.  No flavor.  Like puréed potatoes with green food coloring in it.  Sorry but if your specialty is Sushi, you need to have at least decent/passable wasabi.  Everything else was good."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Overview: 2/10 service, 3/10 food, 5/10 ambiance 
Would not recommend. 

To be honest this place is mediocre at best... The service was really slow and the chef was on his phone right in my face! He didn't even answer me when I tried to get his attention.
The food was fine I guess...
Overall I would not recommend this place. If you're looking for somewhat authentic Japanese food look elsewhere! As an American, I spoke more Japanese than the entire staff combined. There's plenty of great food in Santa Barbara so just go somewhere else."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,The sushi was alright... we had two rolls and sashimi. I was confused on why they charged us for the ponzu than included the tip for 2 people and taxed us on top of it.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I love coming to this sushi spot! I believe that Arigato has better quality sushi however not by much, and Ichibans price point is much much better. The counter sunk tables are an awesome touch, and the guys behind the sushi bar really enjoy talking to you if you'll let them."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I'm sure running a sushi restaurant must be hard.  

But I think the most important thing would be to have fresh fish .

I ate here for lunch on a Saturday and this place had the oldest fish I can ever remember eating.  Very disappointing!!

At least the service was friendly ."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Best sushi. Highly recommend. The sushi rolls were very good especially the crunch roll and the service was fast..one of the waiter looks like Jared Leto too!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Living on Mesa this is our to go place for sushi. Great service, fast and friendly staff. The rainbow roll is bomb!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I'm little disappointed with the sushi roll selections (really sticking with the basics) but the fish has been consistently fresh. The service is great, my hot green tea runneth over...and the prices are very reasonable. Very cute and fun little place in the Mesa."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,Food was not fresh. The Jalapeños on my Cliff Drive roll looked like it had been out since last night. I did not trust eating the food.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Great lunch specials with 1980's prices!!! Always a favorite but lately it seems the place needs a good clean up inside and out......
#santabarbara #food #sbdining"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Good sushi, great customer service, nice atmosphere. 4 stars because the fish quality isn't as good as some of the other sushi spots in town."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,The sushi is delicious and they always have great service.  We like going here because it's never over crowded like a lot of sushi restaurants near state street.  Try the spicy edamame!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Ichiban's sushi is not ""authentic"" Japanese sushi.  The menu caters to the American pallet (daa, ""you're in America""- I get it.).  The rice, 鮨飯 sushi meshi, is too salty/sweet, not subtle in flavor and the sauces poured over different rolls are too strong.  Like a lot of adopted international food in the US, ""natural"" flavors get hidden by adding too much salt and sugar, and using too much ""exotic"" sauce.  If you want a taste of Japanese sushi I would not recommend Ichiban.  Also the chiefs have not been trained in proper Japanese presentation, delivery or etiquette.  Generally they do not speak Japanese, which often adds to the ambiance and experience.  There is nothing wrong with Americanized sushi but Ichiban is not ""authentic Japanese sushi"" if that's what you're seeking.   If you want to experience true Americanized sushi then Ichiban is one of many places for you."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I have been here twice. Once their sushi was the best I had in years, my friend I were amazed at the quality. The second time the sushi was good but the fish wasn't nearly as fresh. When their sushi is good, it is fabulous. Otherwise go to Arigato. If Ichiban can be consistant I would praise them endlessly...until then, spend the extra and go to Arigato. At least you can be promised great fish."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Great date night spot! Speedy service, enthusiastic staff, and delicious food. I recommend the Ichiban roll and Box sushi roll. If you're feeling adventurous ask about the chef special, made especially for you!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"If you're desperate for sushi, this place is merely okay.  Nothing special.  A real hit and miss.  We were somewhat regulars only because we typically love sushi and there aren't many options in Santa Barbara.  But this place was starting to get old fast.  Each time we order, we never know if it's going to be just ok or gross altogether.  The service make it ok to try yet again if you're really graving for Japanese food.  One day, I wanted ramen and thought I'll just order a simple one.  Soba noodle with tempura, and boy, was this a total flop!  The broth tasted like chicken fat and nothing else.  No seasoning, just piping hot chicken fat broth.  You could even see the raw fat floating at the top of it.   After a couple of sips, I immediately wanted to throw up.  The yellow tail sushi we ordered was old and smelled fishy.  Fresh fish never smells fishy.  This sealed our decision to never go back again.  Then we discovered Yume Sushi.  Thank goodness for Yume Sushi."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I have spent time in Japan, and my Japanese language teachers like to make Japanese food for my class many times, so I have a pretty experienced palette when it's about eating Japanese food. This restaraunt is a mix of Americanized sushi, Japanese sushi, and many other dishes apart of japanese cuisine.  A lot of the staff members are actually Japanese immigrants and they are very friendly. Sometimes I may even talk to them in Japanese. A lot of times I see that at times they have a bit of a harder time understanding some customers because the customer is speaking too fast for them to understand. Another example why I like the staff There is even a certain way to eat food in Japan and if you ask they show you. When my brother was eating at the bar and talking with some of the sushi chefs, they even showed them how Japanese usually eat sushi, and I saw this when I was in Japan. I really love the atmosphere of the restaurant. My favorite dish to eat here is the tamagotchi sushi which is actually dessert sushi, and I love their takoyaki. Their takoyaki is not too mushy or chewy in my opinion. Their sushi, I personally think it is perfect. Especially the traditional Japanese sushi, which is what I prefer over American sushi. Each time time I eat sushi there i am reminded of how sushi tastes in Tokyo when I studied there and I feel happy when I eat their sushi.  I think this restaurant overall is a good one. このレストランの料理はおいしかったと思います。"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Sooo good, the 007 rool was amazing. Can't wait to come back!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,This is my favorite sushi in town. Good quality and a good price. Staff is all very nice and love the traditional shoes of tables. They're uni is great which is hard to fine.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"*Hit and miss.

Lunch - Ignored when I walked in, even though the staff saw me, had to seat myself, waited for a good 5-7min with waitresses constantly passing me and actually rude to an extent. Finally ordered and the food was old.  Chicken teriyaki lunch special tasted like it was cooked hours ago and just got heated up.  Other ingredients didn't taste fresh as well. 
Left unsatisfied for sure

In contrast to...

Dinner - the week prior (the reason I came back) where we shared a few rolls that were delicious and we both raved about.  The Chef special foll was $15 and huge and tasty, and the normal rolls were packed with meat and flavor, and deliciousness.  

Not sure on a return now.

That sushi addiction hurts so good."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,I went today for lunch with friends. The wait staff was rude and unpleasant. Such a bad experience and the food was mediocre. Don't think I will return anytime soon.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,This is a really clean sushi restaurant. They have really great customer service too. The sushi I got was tasty and I would definitely go back.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I cant speak for the service because I got sushi for take out but the sushi was not good at all. I've had better sushi from the grocery store. Maybe its better when you eat in but I order take out frequently and am usually pleased by it. Not to mention their website needs some updating, it wont even let you view the menu. You're better off going somewhere downtown for quality sushi. But besides that the staff seemed friendly from my short interaction with them."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"My new favorite Sushi in town and I've been to them all! Lets just say that the last month I was living in SB I went there every week just to get my fill. 
the lunch specials are great and if your a little more adventurous then check out the sweat shrimp AMAZING!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Was leery of coming here after I had heard about the unsanitary way they store and handle their fish, but I thought I'd give it a try anyways. The waitress brought out only 3 menus for the four of us - completely ignoring my daughter. This place isn't exactly kid friendly. The price range is average for a restaurant like this. The miso soup was so bad I didn't finish it, and I usually LOVE miso soup! I ordered the Ichiban roll, but had a hard time eating it since the seaweed wrap was so tough the roll just kept falling apart whenever I would try to chew through it. I originally was going to stay for sone green tea ice cream for dessert - but it got too cold in the restaurant. The people who were with me agreed it was cold and one person put their sweater back on. They do have an Axxess discount, but this only applies if you will be ordering 2 or more rolls. On the upside: nothing. This place has no redeeming qualities."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"When I have the $$ to spend, this is my favorite place for sushi in Santa Barbara.  Their prices are normal for sushi, not as low as Something's Fishy's 50% off specials but better quality (though I love Something's Fishy too.  Omar is the best chef they've got my far.  Have him make your food and it'll taste like a different place.) Their spicy tuna roll rocks, as does the rest of their food.  I could go on about what makes this place great for a while, but that wouldn't be helpful.  5 stars for the food quality alone.  The service is good, the decor is nice, and the location is ok.  If this place was, for instance, to move to a swanky, dimly lit bar like location with trendy, modern decor, I think it'd add that extra spark, but then again, it wouldn't be the Ichiban I love."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"My friend and I were greeted by the nice Japanese workers and the Japanese style seats which made the whole experience more amazing! I would recommend the seafood tempura platter. Roll seemed small for the price. Even though everything was a bit pricey, they compensated with their customer service and the great food"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Authentic Japanese cooking with nice atmosphere. A little pricey but a great visit during restaurant week. The service is wonderful and it is a very spacious venue.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"My daughter and I had lunch here.  It rocked!!!  We had seaweed salad and green salad with delicious ginger dressing!  Then we shared the Ichiban roll and the Volcano roll.  Both were delicious, but the Volcano was AMAZING, our favorite!  The Ichiban roll had a little too much crab for me.  I would have liked more fish and less crab in it.  Other than that, the whole experience was great!  Can't wait to go back!!!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Overall very good to excellent. Nice patio seating. Good nigiri selection with the Tako and salmon being excellent this night. My wife enjoyed the crab puffs and tiger roll. Blue Man roll was tasty with a nice hint of cilantro. Not the best I've ever had but a solid meal in a great location.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Really good food but not great service. Waitress told us our rolls would be 8 piece but they were 6, and another staff member would not allow more than 1 mint to be taken from the mint bowl... it's a mint!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"The place was great! and quick.. It was surprisingly empty when I walked in, but it was a Monday! We were seated in the cushion table area, which I thought was fun. The only thing was the waitress didn't believe my ID was valid - which indeed it was, so besides that it was an overall great experience. I ordered the Katsu Dinner, and the portions were great. I left being very satisfied with my experience."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We love this place! The owner is so welcoming and should we decide to bring our kids they always make space for them. Favorite items: box sushi, all rolls, scallops."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"an all around solid sushi experience.  I don't come here too often as I feel like this place falls in between Edomasa and Arigato in price range, both of which I prefer to Ichiban.  All around solid choice if you are on the mesa and in the mood for sushi."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Ok, folks gonna let you in on a little secret here.  The fish here comes from the same purveyor that some of the better well know places in town IE Arrigato and Ahi. And its cheaper!  Sit at the bar, try the white tuna, order a yellow tail or salmon Kama, and get some decent sake for crying out loud.  Their ambiance is not as nice as the other two, but good enough.  The bathrooms need a little work, but hey I am here for the food!  This is my go to spot as an SB local and if you keep it a secret then all you other foodies out there in SB will thank me.  Oh and another little secret, that most of you fish heads don't know about, most of your sushi fish comes from LA, and its usually delivered on Mondays, and Fridays....hmmm food for thought!  Take that, bam!  Oh, and more parking in the back of the strip mall."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,I ordered a sushi bowl and I was disappointed when it came coz the sushi seemed dry and not very tasty. I also had eel sushi but the chief didn't clean the scales in the fish so that I cannot even swallow it! The service was good though.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I was visiting Santa Barbara and found a Groupon deal.  My family and I had the lunch special, two bento boxes and two sushi boats.  It came with miso soup (a bit too salty).  The bento box was a bento box with beef, salad, some potato thing and tempura.  My family enjoyed their food.

The reason for the 4 stars is the waitress didn't come around to refill our drinks until the end.  I get thirsty, so it'd be nice to have some more liquids during the meal.  It's a nice place near the beach, decent lunch prices."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Great neighborhood sushi spot that offers excellent fresh Japanese bites!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I always come and order their lunch special. It is pretty filling and comes with miso soup, side of rice and then the lunch (with your choice of teiyaki chicken, tempura, little orange slice, rolls, udon noodles, etc. basically a lot of options.) The staff is always friendly and smiling."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,the service was fast and friendly......The atmosphere was good and the chef compted all the folks at the sushi bar some lovely deep fried fish and squid.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"You people that complain about this place need to JUST STAY HOME, bunch of babies. Awesome place, great service, we will be back. Complainers, just makes it better for us together in and enjoy the food."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I needed a last-minute sushi restaurant for a surprise birthday party (when the other sushi restaurant canceled my reservation due to size).  Ichiban Sushi (1812 Cliff Dr) did an exceptional job serving our busy party of 25 people. There were drinks / appetizers on the table when we walked in, food served correctly, perfect timing, and they even allowed me to bring an outside cake.  They provided the perfect atmosphere for a celebration. I will definitely host large parties there again! This is a restaurant knows their business and the food is excellent."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Great place. Authentic Japanese decor with delicious sushi and sake...
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Quality fish, generous rolls without too much rice, delicious flavors, and great service!!!! Definitely returning.  Also omg. The eel n avacado roll.  Omg. Nom nom nom!!!!! Go here!!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Sushi here is totally fresh and the presentation is excellent. The portion is definitely on the generous side for Santa Barbara. We were greeted and seated pretty fast and server was friendly and attentive for a busy Friday night. I had Ikura Donburi and sashimi plate--wow, both were amazing. The only downside here is you can't try more dishes in smaller portions before getting stuffed! Will definitely be back soon!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"My experience here was great. I ordered the Tonkatsu, Salmon Sashimi (2 orders), and the Crunch roll, they were all on point.

Tonkatsu: like most reviewers had, tasted really authentic and was a good portion amount. It comes with rice, salad, and miso soup which was very enjoyable. Price was very fair

Salmon Sashimi: Sashimi is like the steak compared to fish. It is hard to make and prepare so they usually cost more than you would want to pay for. I had 4 piece which were two orders and it was exactly what I was hoping it to be. 

Crunch Roll: I really liked how they fried this roll, the chef definitely knows how to provide authentic material. However I didn't like that the roll had carrots, I should have known earlier and told them to take it out.

Wasabi was also on point, which most japanese restaurants can't provide.

Overall Food quality:5/5
Overall Food price: 4/5
Customer Service: 5/5"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"This place has great sushi and is conveniently located on the Mesa, so you don't have to worry about parking downtown.  Every time I've been there I've never had to wait, and I usually sit at the sushi bar.  The sushi chefs always suprise us with dishes that they think we will love-- so nice! And if you don't try anything else, try the 007 roll- YUM!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,This place has gotten much better since it came under new management a couple years ago! This is where I go every time I'm in town for fresh sushi and seafood. Arigato is a little bit too played up - true sushi lovers should come here. It's also just a lot easier to park and in a quieter part of town on the Mesa.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Chris the waiter was cool, ask for him
We were visiting from Orange County 
Recommend this place"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I live on the Mesa and love this sushi spot.
My husband and I eat early, 6ish, and have never encountered the crowds other reviewers speak about. 
Although we have other sushi option close we prefer to dine here as we find the seafood super fresh and the staff friendly. 
We always order the fisherman's boat which has fresh sushi, tempura vegetables, shrimp, teriyaki chicken plus miso soup.
It's a ton of food for a reasonable price and we always leave stuffed. 
If I could change one thing it would be to offer refills on their soft drinks.."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I came here for my birthday and was very satisfied. ""Ichiban means number one in Japan"" is written on all the cute little flags in the restaurant and this place is definitely among the best of the best. For appetizer I got kama, yellowtail cheek and it was so big! The waiter (and older Japanese gentlemen) told me that they get the biggest yellowtail in Santa Barbara and that's why Ichiban has some of the biggest servings of kama. For dessert they gave me fried cake with green tea ice cream in the middle because it was my birthday :) Overall I had a wonderful experience. I love that they have the option for you to take your shoes off and sit in those cute little Japanese booths!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Pluses:

Incredibly sweet staff.
Adorable tables, shoes off - Japanese style.
Fresh, tasty fish.
Quick seating. 

Minuses:


Chef (or waitress translating?) unfamiliar with common dishes:

Ex 1. We ordered Albacore Tataki and the albacore was delicious, in thick slices -  but it was not tataki at all. No ponzu, no onions, not seared, not anything. Sashimi - with some smelt eggs. 

Ex 2. Ordered sea bream with yuzukosho and salt. Waitress did not know what sea bream was - or yuzukosho. nigiri came to us with a thick tasty orange sauce (when we were half way done but nice ) , no salt and a tsp size heap of Yuzukosho that if anyone put in their mouth would burn the heck out of them, luckily I removed most of it before anyone ate it - so the girls loved it but it was still too hot. 

So I really do like this place and the fish was nice and fresh and good sized pieces - but I have never been to a good sushi place where the chef was not familiar with these basic orders. I think they are a Nigiri and Roll place. Recommend for simple nigiri and rolls."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"One of my favorite sushi places on the Mesa.  Quality sushi and service, with moderate prices."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,Not a big fan since the food is not worth it's expensive price. The sushi is the best to try in the menu.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We had friends in town who wanted Sushi so we took them to Ichiban.  We had been there once before, remembered the spicy edamame and decided to go back again.  We are so glad we did because we really enjoyed our dinner. The staff was so friendly and attentive.  We were seated right away and of course ordered the spicy edamame.  It was just as good as we remembered.  All of food was really good!  No complaints here and when the bill came, the price was right.  Only thing we didn't like was soda in a can.  Overall, great food and service for the money.  We will be back again for sure."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,This place was Awesome! 007 is great. Scallops were super! Beer on tap was ice cold and service was friendly with a smile. I'll go here again.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Terrible place for vegetarians!!! They can't even provide a ""VEGGIE udon noodle"" order without Fish broth!!!! I simply ordered the veggie udon dish with broth on the side since I knew it was made with fish powder and they said there's no way to cook it without, when in reality noodles can cook in water without the fish powder OBVIOUSLY ! Terrible customer service and would do nothing for providing me the incorrect order !"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Delicious California roll, chicken teriyaki is much better than the beef teriyaki. Great value for such delicious food"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Came here with the groupon! Very good specialty rolls at a pretty good price. Try the 007 rolls!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"My favorite place to get sushi in Santa Barbara.  Reasonable prices, quick service, and fresh fish."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Cliff drive roll and 007 roll are very good! Great service and a good option for take out on the mesa.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,The staff is always wonderful. I don't eat seafood so I can't speak to that but my boyfriend hasn't ever been disappointed. The spicy tempura asparagus rolls are my favorite! Very delicious. I can't recall the last time we have gone more than a few weeks without visiting Ichiban.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Good sushi place, not the best, but their 007 roll is very good! They have some traditional type of table, and the service is nice. The prices are normal for a sushi place, not cheap, but not overpriced."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Best sushi by fare in Santa Barbara. It is away from downtown but worth every minute. Might need a small bit of help on the the customer service side. But great food and not horrible service. Can't wait to go back again.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"The sushi was mediocre nothing special, not to mention we waited 20 minutes after getting our first roll just to find out that the chef forgot to make our other roll."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"This place is one if the better sushi restaurants in town. While I often go to places like Edomasa and Ahi, which I love, Ichiban alone with a few others seem to have a higher quality of sushi grade fish.  

The price is higher but worth it although I don't know if if some of the rolls are worth the price.

This place has a good look to it and good atmosphere and I would definitely recommend it.  They're also in the SB Axxess book for free roll if you have the card."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,We are so glad this great spot was purchased and renewed some years back.  Ichiban has excellent sushi and easy access for picking up orders to go. Previously the service was a disaster and now their staff is quite attentive and pleasant! We eat there or pick up variety of items a few times a month!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"We called ahead to confirm that they will accept service dogs - which they did! Thank you!

They were one of the few well rated sushi restaurants in the area that were open for lunch on a Sunday. 

A few comments:
-Very good gyozo
-Was able to quickly seat a large party (about 8 people)
-There is NO salt added on their edamame
-The 007 was sadly not very good at all :( Fishy and too many flavors competing for attention
-I personally liked the decor and the tatame mat tables. I see a few reviews where people did not like the decor - to be fair, it's the first and only sushi place I have tried so far in Santa Barbara."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"A friend and I went here one night just to try it out for the first time, and we were not disappointed. The staff was amazing. I have never had such sweet kind hearted individuals help me out! They even accept axxess cards! which is amazing. If you have not gone here. Please try it at least once. I think you'll enjoy the service and delicious food they have to offer."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"We read the reviews and came expecting it to be a good place, but it turned out to be a terrible experience.
First of all, the service was awful and the long wait was uncalled for. Upon entering the restaurant, it was as if no one cared if there were customers coming in and waiting for a table. It was like, ""hello? Anyone work here?"" while servers walked around the place. It took almost 15 min before anyone acknowledged us and then seemed to ""forget"" about us as 2 bigger groups went ahead of us and got seated. 
All this time we had two kids who were starving but they had their heart set on Japanese food. I wish we had walked out then. I felt like they didn't want our business.
After we waited for almost one hour and finally got to sit down, I ordered promptly since I knew what we wanted. Well, again, slow, indifferent (almost arrogant) service.
What bothered me most was the servers wouldn't seat us at an empty table. There were tables but the staff was inefficient at turning tables around. I saw other customers who were seated without any water or menu. Come on, figure out how to get customers seated and get them
menu and water, at a minimum. 
Finally, they served over-priced sub-par food. For example, for an below-the-average sashimi set (3 PC tuna, 3 PC salmon, 3 PC hamachi), it was $25.95 and udon noodles for kids, $15. A small bowl of edamame was $4.95. 
Funny part was the waitress told me the sashimi set was a good deal. I don't mind paying, but I like to pay for good food and service that match the price.
Won't be coming ever again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Food is tasty however in my opinion this place is EXTREMELY UNSANITARY. I witnessed waitresses reusing previously used water cups and simply adding ice. 
I asked the waitress for a new cup and she did give me a ""new cup"" but it had also been used by someone else. 
I rate Ichiban 2 stars based on the taste of the food
Excellent chefs, unsanitary waitresses .."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"A nice neighborhood sushi joint on the Mesa. Good quality but higher prices deserve more. There are better places that fit the bill in Santa Barbara.
Week nights or weekends finds Ichiban packed with a line out the door. It must be the location and family feel that pack um in for this, nothing special sushi house. And pack in they do with moms and dads, kids and dates all jockeying for a seat.
Standard offerings with a marginal sake menu. I find most of the waitresses are knowledgeable about the rice wine and will help you pick out the right fit for you.
All and all it's good, constant, clean and friendly but you can do better off The Mesa."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Looks like a promising try, but sadly I got burned on using my groupon coupon. They were very strict on how to honor the coupon. They would not let me redeem the coupon unless there were 4 people in the group, and only for lunch. Probably my mistake, buying a groupon 4 people for lunch, thinking we will use it even though there were only two of us, I figure we will order for 4 and just take leftovers home, but no go."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Ichiban is a great alternative to the expense of Arrigato. The sushi is fresh and the ambiance is comfortable. Easy parking and good service.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I came here once a long time ago with a family friend who knew the chefs, and while the second experience was not quite as fun, I was again impressed with the experience. I ordered the chirashi and was pleasantly surprised with the amount and quality of the food. The sashimi was actually served separately from the rice (see photo), and I even got a bite of seaweed salad and a miso soup to go with it, making for a satisfying meal. It seems like the lunch specials are the best values here, though."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We sat at the bar which is our favorite so we can talk to the sushi chef. He was friendly and knowledgable at his craft. The sushi itself was fresh and tasty. 
We checked in on YELP and got a free App of edamname. We had a beer and saki and our bill was $85 total with tip.  About average for good sushi in Santa Barbara.  We will eat here again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I am a sushi lover and last weekend, my family and I went to a new sushi restaurant called Ichiban. To start off, the tables were pretty amazing. It was in the style of a Japanese restaurant and we had to take our shoes off and sit on little mats. I ordered a roll and my family ordered lunch combos and everything tasted delicious. The fish was very fresh and the sauce was flavorful. I wish we could go here more but it is a bit of a drive. Overall awesome restaurant though!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"The food was just ok. Nice ambiance. Ordered tempura and the dipping sauce was tasteless. Salad dressing lacked flavor, too ....thick texture like ground carrots - not plesant."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"My friend and I decided to go for a last minute sushi run and we decided to go here since it was close to where I was staying and my love for sushi.  I ordered the Spicy Tuna roll, the Philadelphia roll, and the Futomaki roll.  The service was fine.  The spicy tuna was ok.  The salmon in the Philadelphia roll was yuck - not fresh at all.
The Futomaki roll was even worse.  It was made poorly and just fell apart the second I picked it out.  Every single one of them did that.
I didn't finish my meal.  I was visiting from The OC and but I won't be back visiting that place again.  No thank you."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"We were seated promptly and served fast.  Their rolls are pretty typical, nothing too creative, but the basics work. 

We got three rolls and a dinner combination, the fish misoyaki was quite good.  

The rolls were good, fresh but not anything to write home about.  but overall, it was a good dinner.

The deco is simple, but I love the fact that they have tatami mats along the side of the room and you can sit japanese style. 

Total bill about $60, which I found to be affordable for sushi."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,Came into Ichiban at 9:30 to get some dinner and was confronted by a rude employee telling us that we couldn't eat there unless it's a to-go order because they close at 10. Just made us really mad because both I and and my boyfriend work at restaurants and we always serve customers until close especially 30 minutes before close! Just a big let down to our night because we got all dressed up and ended up having to take food to-go.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Food- three stars.  Service- one star.

Food was ok, nothing special.  I have had much better. Service was poor.  Our waitress was disinterested and not helpful.

I will never going to this place again.  Wouldn't recommend."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Always good service, very kid friendly and really good food! We like the tatami tables and usually opt for a boat dinner which is more than enough for 2 adults and 1 child."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Ichiban is the Mesa sushi joint, the food is really good and I like the setting too, and the waiters take good care of you. My personal favorite is the 007 roll, these guys will always have my business. :)"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,ALWAYS my favorite go to sushi restaurant and that's from a locals point of view. The 007 is a must and a specialty!!! Their lunch combos are super cheap and fresh and delicious. They even have those Japanese booths you take your shoes off to sit in!! I LOVE IT HERE.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Good local sushi house on the Mesa.  Atmosphere is quaint, food is fresh and tasty and service is good.   Never a wait and prices are fair and reasonable.  They serve some interesting rolls and good portions when ordering the sashimi.  Just good food for a good price."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Yummy spicy tuna rolls, and the rainbow roll was out of this world, fresh, succulent and melt in the mouth, and awsome tempura,
But........the yellowtail roll I ordered last time  tasted of a kind of polluted fishiness. I couldn't eat it, it  was that revolting!!!!

 Ichiban is actually a cute sushi restaurant with great sushi most of the time,and  a very good reputation in Santa Barbara. There are also traditional  tables you  kneel or sit at, for that more authentic japanese feel,and it is reasonably priced, and good service. 
Me and my  friends who are a mixture of fish-eaters and vegetarians loved the other sushi, so we will be coming back despite this one disappointing experience."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Great local spot! Always fresh and at great prices! Will absolutely return! (Yellowtail is my favorite)
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I have tried a few sushi spots while here in SB but so far, this is the best. The portion sizes are huge! (unlike the over rated Something Fishy spot on State...sorry) 
The unagi was perfect! The whole roll was covered with eel on top of every piece, yummy! And big rolls! The atmosphere is casual and low key. They have a few booth tables on the floor, or so you feel like it. Green tea was fine. Service was okay. I will use this spot for my sushi fix while I am in town for a few months. Enjoy!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,Had lunch here it was ok nothing specail but very reasonably priced
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"The best mid-end sushi place in SB! They always have incredibly fresh and delicious fish and for quite a fair price!
I highly recommend the Chef's Special roll!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Dinner date Tbe other evening with my roommate for the first time. This place is incredible. We shared the Mesa roll and lobster/tuna rolls...both specialties. They were incredible. The staff is so attentive and makes you feel like you're family. I would recommend this place for anyone in Santa Barbara looking for the best sushi in town!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Sushi is not very fresh, edamame was over cooked and over priced and the rolls aren't fairly priced for what you're getting. I won't be coming back again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Went here because of a Groupon. Had a decent experience!

My review is based on my experiences of sushi around SB. I may not be an expert on sushi here, but I was tired of the crazy prices of Sushiya in Isla Vista. Since it's expensive around here, the Groupon was a godsend. 

To begin, I liked the atmosphere. We went for Saturday lunch and the store was pretty empty. We got to sit on the traditional Japanese seating area, which was really cool! The table in front of us had a kid who was dripping apple juice all over his cushion though, I wonder how often the cushions are cleaned? Anyway, the staff was pretty attentive to us. There was a teenager and an Asian woman (who might be the manager?) who checked up on us a lot.

We got the Ichiban roll, which was 5 BIG pieces. We also got the 007 roll and a baked roll (Volcano? or Dragon?). The Ichiban roll was good, but we felt the others had too much mayo and too much imitation crab. It was really creamy. 

The bill was 40 total and with the Groupon it was 20. Good thing we had a Groupon because I don't think it would be worth $20 per person, but hey, it's Santa Barbara."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Great staff and atmosphere. Good price for what you get. The BEST sushi chefs in Santa Barbara by far. Sushi is made like a pro and tastes delicious and fresh every single time I go there. Has never let me down. Not many people know of it because they will go to Sushi Teri or Something's Fishy, but nothing will ever beat Ichiban. They know their stuff. Avoid downtown like the plague and all that tourist crap, and go to the mesa. It's one of the few places left in Santa Barbara that hasn't been ""Los Angelized"" and you don't have to deal with awful people."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We came here today during lunch and everything we ordered came out quick and tasted fresh and yummy. We ordered an avocado salmon roll, ell roll, and 007 specialty roll. We sat at the bar and got our rolls very quick. We used our Groupon and got a great deal for these three rolls. 
The bathroom was clean and away from the kitchen and the size of the place was decent for the location. 
Parking wasn't very easy but I think it's worth it for the quality of the food."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"The fish is so fresh (Duh! We are in Santa Barbara!) The uni just melts in your mouth, the oysters are plump and briny, the Japanese scallops are so delicate and sweet, and the yellowtail...should call it YUMMYtail! Soft shell crab is local, fresh and spot on. Very friendly and attentive staff. LOVE THIS PLACE!!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Staff was delightful and courteous in answering all my questions. The sushi rolls were delicious, and it was family friendly! Highly recommend! The 007 roll was perfect for this pregnant momma and out of this world! My kids loved the beef and rice bowl!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Great lunch specials with 1980's prices!!!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"There were a few items that I really enjoyed: agedashi tofu ( I ended up ordering another one cause I didn't want to share with anyone else), korean short ribs- which reminded me of the ones my mom made when I was growing up, cucumber/seaweed salad and their ichiban roll. The other sushi items we ordered weren't that good. The next time I go back I'm going to order those exact four items again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,I would definitely go for the Korean short ribs. They are killer. Almost all of their food is great. Their sushi on the other hand is just extremely hit and miss. When it's on it's great but when it's off... Well you know.   If your looking for amazing fresh never fails fish then you all know where to go. Google it. Best and always will be. And say hi to Daryl. Hardest working man in Santa Barbara.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Good service, great food! I would consider this place my favorite place for sushi. It's not too expensive for the high quality, and I would definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers. I've never had a bad experience here."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"This place is one of the more consistent sushi restaurants in Santa Barbara. The prices are fair, the service is friendly, and most of all if you are in need of a quick bite to eat, they can get you in and out very quickly. I really highly recommend the Cliff Drive roll as well as the spicy edamame. Definitely suggest this place!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,This place rocks!  It's no Arigato but for the price you just can't beat it.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"You get what you pay for.  Not too expensive nor cheap.    

We ordered the chirashi - typical sashimi, no uni (sea urchin) in there (disappointed). 

Hamachi Kama was over cooked a little, making it a little dry.
Ichiban Roll was okay
Tofu - two huge pieces.  Wish they have cut it into smaller pieces...instead of just frying two LARGE pieces and making the middle tofu without any flavors.  

The menu is very limited."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Very friendly service. When we walked in the door, everyone from the chef to the server, to the hosts said a cheerful hello. The place was very clean and well keept, and the food was great.  The prices seem a bit steep for the quality (it's good), but I've had better in places like San Francisco or L.A. for the same or cheaper.  Overall i'd definitely recommend this place and rank it as one of the better sushi spots in town"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"LOUD,LOUD,LOUD. Bad acoustics, but good sushi - like the asparagus roll."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Ichiban is a quality Japanese restaurant. The pricing is average and the food is good. The service here was just okay, because the staff wasn't very personal, but they got the job done adequately. My party especially liked the appetizers that we ordered (Beef Maki Maki & Fried Scallops). Their sushi boats are a bit more expensive than at other restaurants in town, but it was an impressive array of food. The atmosphere is quite nice and there is a tatami seating section which gives you the option of sitting cross legged or regularly (helping  out the tall folks)."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Let me preface this by saying that I've been coming to Ichiban since I was kid, so maybe I have a bit of a biased opinion, but here it goes: I conveniently live just down the hill, so I'm here about two or three times a month. It's a great, casual spot. The service is always good. They have an ongoing 10% off deal with Axxess. 

Overall my favorite, ""where do you want to go for dinner?"" ""I don't know, anywhere"" restaurant.

I would be willing to bet a delicious Box Roll that most of the commenters below that say ""the service felt rushed"" have probably never worked in the restaurant industry and don't understand that when it's busy... the service will understandably be rushed. Better than shitty service, in my opinion. I've had Lucy serve my table several times, and she's always on point. Always very polite. 

The prices are a little higher, and when I'm looking for a more upscale restaurant I'll swing by Sakana or Arigato. But hey, the fish is fresh and there's plenty of parking. 
4/5!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I frequent Ichiban because it's consistently good, reasonably priced, and the service is great. I recommend trying their spicy edamame."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"My dinners here with good friends are among my most treasured dining experiences in Santa Barbara--something about kicking off your shoes and relaxing at one of the low tables, the warm, diffuse lighting, the faint scent of salty ocean air wafting in through the front door in a way that only happens up in the mesa neighborhood, and (of course) the best sushi in Santa Barbara. The menu is refreshingly uncomplicated, the interior not overly styled. These days it's hard to find a place that isn't projecting some kind of unrealistic image of itself, some kind of facade. Ichiban is all genuineness and substance though.  Realists will feel right at home here. I always do."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,Decent sushi and the Udon noodles are good although a tad salty! I enjoy coming here because the service is very good and the prices are reasonable.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Fish at Ichiban is some of the freshest in town and the low table seating adds a warmth and coziness to the ambiance you don't usually find at sushi restaurants. Ichiban is my second favorite Japanese restaurant after Sakana, but the price point is high for what you get. Two glasses of white wine, an eel avocado roll, and two pieces of yellowtail sushi will set you back about $40. Not to say the fish isn't - indeed - extremely fresh and beautifully sliced, but the overall experience doesn't merit the price tag. Despite the freshness of the fish, the ambiance is just a little too similar to the many other, generic sushi houses around town to earn such a bump in price."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Great lunch everything fresh and delicious.  If your a Japanese foodie try this restaurant.. Very, Very Good!!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"This restaurant provides some of the best sushi I have ever tasted and wonderful customer service from the waiters and servers. On the other hand, the management is difficult to aware financial mistakes with. With my credit card being over charged and a long dispute with the owner taking place, I was disturbed to recommend this restaurant for a while. However, my experience is rare, so I do recommend people to stop on by and give this place a try."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"The service is really not that great, nor is the food. 
The convenience of it being the most local sushi restaurant was the only thing that kept me coming. 
However, I've accepted the fact that if I wanted to be satisfied with my meal, I wouldn't necessarily go here."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,I went to ichiban last Tuesday having some sushi it was great till I saw the older chef cough on the food that he was making I was like wtf I'm not going back
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,The miso soup was like dish water. The sushi was made with poor quality ingredients. They did not honor the Axxess special as advertised. There are far better Japanese restaurants in town - forget this one.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Well there may be numerous sushi joints in the area, it's difficult finding one you would want to frequent.

Enter Ichiban. After eating here a 2x I can officially say it has made it into rotation.

First things first... looking at the sushi chefs here and seeing that the majority are of Japanese descent is a plus. Maybe this makes me a snob, or maybe not, but having Pablo make my sushi isn't exactly my idea of authentic.

Located on the Mesa in a strip mall setting with other restaurants. The decor at Ichiban is simple and plain. I do enjoy the tatami style seating offered.

Service is polite and friendly. A little forgetful with refilling waters and such however they check in on you often so all you need to do is ask.

The menu offers quite a few Japanese entrees, standard rolls, and a limited number of specialty rolls. Sashimi is offered despite not printed/priced on the menu. Favorite rolls include the Ichiban Roll and Box Sushi. Cannot wait to try the short ribs on the next visit, look delicious!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"This place is my favorite Japanese/Sushi restaurant. Always super tasty and fresh, reasonably priced.  Clean and nice people running it! Can't beat it!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"It's a solid place for classic sushi. Sit at the bar, order a couple beers, and let the sushi chefs convince you to try something new. Fish is always fresh and delicious."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,I love muscles and service. I eat here often. The staff is wayyy 2 nice. Great chefs.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"My wife and I have eaten at Ichiban for many years.  There are lots of items to choose from, and the quality and service are always superb.  Of course, we all have favorites, and mine are the Beef Donburi - a beef and rice bowl with lots of ginger and a tasty, sweet broth - and the 007 sushi roll.  My strict vegetarian wife has no difficulty finding yummy items to order."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Hasn't been here before. Ordered food to go. A nice lady took my order and checked me out. 
Was clean and very busy at 6pm. 

I will probably try again. Eat in to get the full experience."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Love this place! I live on the mesa and am so happy we have Ichiban. Food is great, service is very friendly and prompt and the prices are reasonable. I only ever get sushi or sushi rolls so I can't really say anything about the rest of the menu but my kids seem to like just about everything."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Came with a group of 4 and had a coupon deal.  I would say overall food was just so so, ok service but felt rushed.  Salmon sushi, spicy tuna roll, chicken teriyaki combo - I'm struggling to say anymore more that..."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Definitely my favorite sushi spot in Santa Barbara. Food always seems to appear quickly, even during the peak busy times. And every server I've ever had here is perfectly attentive without being smothering. All in all I love this place and will always recommend."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"The food a good, it is REALLY good. I had one of the best udon there, ever.

But, I'm not sure if it's related... after having a half bowl of delicious raw salad (and this is probably my fault since this is peak romaine e-coli season) ... I had two full days of diarrhea. Took me out a full week. I don't blame the restaurant though, I was fully warned on the news.

Regardless of my illness, the food was really great, and I'd just say, as long as you eat everything cooked, you simply can't go wrong at this restaurant. Recommended."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"As what the other customer stated, portions here are way smaller in comparable to our normal western size of sushi rolls. I bought a lobster spicy tempura roll for $16.5 and they only provided me a 5 pcs . Taste is clean and fresh. My guess is, we are here paying for the sushi master's technique and skills to create sushi. Other than that, taste are on point. Just to keep in mind, don't expect to have a heavy meal here."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I did not get the sushi here.   Refer to other reviews if you want to know about the sushi.  Looked up ramen on yelp and found this joint.   We ordered the pork ramen and the udon (the one with chicken and an egg).  Both were not good at all.  The ramen was salty and the pork was chewy with some weird taste to it.  The udon was purely noodles with a little bit of other ingredients.  The menus smelled like they were wiped with old wet towels.

My biggest issue with this place is the service.  I had looked at the menu wanting udon (the one you'd expect would have broth).  I accidentally ordered some other type that was dry with sauce instead.  When I told the waitress that I wanted one with the broth, she just kept explaining that I ordered one that didn't have the broth.  Well duh, I can see that I made the mistake since you brought out one without broth.  She was not helpful at all.  The dish did not smell appealing at all so I definitely didn't want it. I ended up just ordering the one with the broth, waited forever for it, and still had to pay my original order.  I basically took it togo, tried a little the next day to find out that it did not taste good just as I had expected, and threw it in the trash.  I have never been to a restaurant that didn't let you return something you didn't want.  I walked out very unsatisfied."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I have spent so much money at this place. And no, not because it's expensive, but because I absolutely LOVE ichiban. This is me and my boyfriends date spot. We always order a couple of sushi rolls, some sake and Japanese beers. Try the mesa roll!!!! It's crunchy rice with spicy tuna and avocado. My all time favorite. Also it's a must try the tempura green tea ice cream!!!! 

They have a cool set up where you can sit down criss cross apple sauce and get the full experience! 

Love the staff they're always happy and in a great mood. I have nothing bad to say about this place!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Tiffany is the best server ever!!!! She's super sweet and the chopsticks in her hair are super cute!!!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Loved the food here. Right from their Miso soup which in itself was oh so delicious.
Based on other yelper's reviews we ordered the Spicy Tuna roll which was delicious. But the best thing there was their Dinner plate with Sashimi and Chicken Teriyaki. 
The ambience of the place was warm and friendly. And they have a custom to say bye to their customers which made us want to visit them again :)"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,The sushi was good. The service was poor. We ordered take out and we're told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. We ended up sitting around for 45 minutes before our rolls were ready. We would have appreciated more honest communication about the time it would take to make our order.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"This restaurant okay, not great, during visits for lunch in the last few years, but a recent experience during dinner time was so rude we will never return.  The server barely acknowledged us on entry, then was upset that we moved to a different table (only 4 tables occupied). She refused to wait on us for 13 more minutes. Serving staff poor on prior visits, and killed this place on our list forever.  Plenty of other places nearby!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Great staff, great food, great price! What else do you want? I will be coming back to Ichiban for the entirety of my college career. 

Must haves: Short ribs, Cali Roll, Miso Soup, 007 Roll"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We ordered sushi from Ichiban. It was fresh, delicious and came in time.
We will order again soon! I highly recommend !"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"YUM! This place serves up a wonderful lunch! I was so impressed with everything. The service was fantastic, the atmosphere was great and the food was delightful. We had the gyoza, which was crispy and good, the tempura, once again a great crunch. The sushi was fresh. I loved the mesa roll!!! All the flavors were on point!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"There are all too many mediocre sushi restaurants in Santa Barbara, but Ichiban defies the trend.  Their rolls are delicately made.  I used to work at a sushi restaurant (see homma's brown rice in palo alto), and know the pitfalls of poor rice spreading technique.  Ichiban's sushi chefs prepare rolls that have good texture, and the seaweed breaks easily with each bite, avoiding awkward mouthfuls of sushi on first dates.  The sushi ingredients taste...for lack of a better word ... fresh.

If I go back on a weekend (i'm a weekday pescatarian...probably a phase but I'm fully aware of it), I'd try the beef sukiyaki. 

On the pricey side ($20-$30 for a modest dinner), but well worth it."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Honestly not a fantastic place. We ordered some salmon dinner combos and it was dull and flavorless, majority of the flavor came from the sauce it was drowned in. Cold in the middle, sent back, cold again. Sushi was not the best either, it was clearly not fresh and the staff put us at fault and got upset that we didn't like it. They were clearly annoyed at us and service kept getting worse and worse. The food is super over priced for such bad quality. On top of that, they charge the most ridiculous amount of tax. Don't think I will return here, hope they improve for themselves."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,I seriously don't understand how people come back here. The chef's anger is felt from the first hello. The hours are ridiculous and the food tastes like it was dragged through asphalt. Worst experience ever.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Great, quick service. Went in a big party of around 13-14 people for a dinner party and they did a great job getting everyone exactly what they ordered very quickly. My friend barely finished her drink when a waitress was at her side asking if she wanted a refill; she was back with it in less than a minute. 
And, when the checks came, they had already been made into separate tabs. 

Along with the service, the food was excellent. Depending on what was ordered, portions could have been a bit bigger, but as far as my dinner companions were concerned, everything had a really nice flavor to it.The dinner combination was a good deal - chicken teriyaki with rice, miso soup to start, salad, and a california roll for less than $20."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Just went there for dinner and left.  I' thought I'd give it a try.  Really Rude waitress!!! The sushi chefs are not real sushi chefs and the writing on the menus are so tiny I couldn't read it.  But the RUDE waitress killed it.  She made me wait extra for a readable menu and yelled,  ""I have other customers!"" When there was only one other table. Never going back.  Wow."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,These folks are doing a great job keeping us fed with great food during this trying time!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I'm a regular here whenever I'm in Santa Barbara! And I always check in to get the free steamed edamame. (:

My rainbow roll was adequate. Some of the salmon tasted fishy but nothing to complain about. 

Parking can be kind of tough if you come during peek hours for dinner. There's usually a spot behind the restaurant, but the lot is quite bumpy.

I enjoy being seated at the traditional Japanese tables because I like crossing my legs while I eat. However, it's not for everyone and there's a space to put your legs into underneath the table. 

Thanks for the great times, Ichiban!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I have enjoyed Ichiban for many years. An easy to find place with a sweet neighborhood vibe. Very casual, even for Santa Barbara standards, which means you could see someone in a bathrobe picking up takeout. I think over the years we've tasted the entire menu. The fish has always been fresh.  Sometimes we order the veg tempura. It's always light in texture and never too greasy. They feature a small but varied Saki menu as well.  The last few times we've visited they weren't serving the coveted Dragon Roll. The servers (we usually see Keiko)  always have a smile and are very attentive."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"After reading other reviews, we gave it a try.  Honestly, I think very few people have had great sushi  - is this qualifies as good.  It was probably the blandest, most flavourless sushi either of us had ever eaten.  The service was good but the food was so disappointing.  The menus could use a good wipe down as well.  I have eaten more flavourful sushi in a food court."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"My partner and I came here for Valentine's Day and we had the $20 Groupon deal (buh-less), which we definitely put to use! We ordered the Korean ribs + California roll plate, the 007 roll, and the cliff drive roll. They were all really good and the California roll was the best California roll I've ever had...But maybe that's because I usually don't order it at sushi restaurants. The sauce for the 007 roll was a-maz-ing and the cliff drive roll was okay. The service was great, super immediate, and everyone was nice. The décor was fitting and also felt very home-y. There was the sushi bar, some regular tables and chairs, and tables with mats so that you could sit on the floor if you wanted to. Overall, it was a good experience!

P.S. The sushi may be a bit pricey so I def recommend grouponing it. We had a $42 meal for $22!!!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I ordered a small hot sake, Large Sapporo, salmon skin hand roll, tuna, grilled tuna and miso soup. It was very filling. The hand-roll was made to perfection, very tasty and nice and warm. Tuna was fresh and had the right amount of ginger and wasabi. Service was friendly and welcoming. They didn't rush but asked me if I was okay / needed anything throughout my dining experience."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We decided to try a new sushi stop, I'm always hesitant but this place delivered! My husband LOVED his dish, it was some sort of fried rice square with tuna on top, he also got a snake roll, and some tuna sashimi. I got a California roll and tuna & avocado roll which were good. Great atmosphere and pleasant staff."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I'd give this place a 3.5 stars if possible. Not quite a 4 but not a 3 either.

My friend and I came for lunch. We love trying new sushi places so we decided to come here. It took us a while to decide what rolls to get. There weren't very many options compared to some other places around SB so that was kind of disappointing. Eventually we ordered:

007 roll: we subbed the shrimp for salmon and it was so good! Avocado, salmon, and cream cheese inside. I'm normally not a cream cheese sushi person but this one hit the spot today.

Chefs special: spicy tuna and shrimp tempura inside, topped with salmon and special sauce (I want to say it's some sort of miso sauce and teriyaki sauce). I enjoyed this roll as well. My friend didn't like that it was pretty covered in sauce, but I thought the sauce coverage was fine.

If you check in on Yelp you get free edamame (which is normally like $5-6 sheesh it's just edamame lol). The server wouldn't let us use both of our Yelp offers, which I guess is expected.

This place is a little pricey compared to some of the other places we've been to, but the quality was decent. I'd come here again I guess if I want some free edamame and I'm not feeling adventurous with my sushi, but if I want more variety I'd hit up a different place."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I came here for lunch with a Groupon deal. The service was very poor, with the waitress taking 15 minutes just to bring water, then disappearing before we could order. A quick sushi lunch took over an hour due to the delays in waitress service. The food was not anything special and overpriced for what you got."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Delicious food, very fresh. A nice treat! Sushi was very good, as well as the Udan and teriyaki chicken."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Great local sushi!! Love it 
Box sushi, chef special roll and spicy asparagus rolls are the best."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I came on a Saturday afternoon and got a lunch combination - chicken teriyaki and California roll for $8.95. I was impressed with the amount of food for that price. It came with miso soup, a little salad, rice, and some kind of small appetizer type thing. I used the yelp check in offer for free edamame, too, so I was very full! I even took some of the leftover edamame and chicken teriyaki home! Service was very good. I can't speak for their actual sushi since this was my first time there - but the teriyaki was good. I would go back , especially for the good lunch deals."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,First time visit. Excellent value on food and service. Our server Akiko is very friendly.  We will definitely be back!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"The lady in this place has been INCREDIBLY rude the TWO times we have been in here. This last time we ordered for pick up and immediately realized we ordered the wrong roll and immediately called to change the order. The lady said we had to change it through Grubhub since we went through yelp. I immediately hang up and call Grubhub. They text a confirmation with the price difference and change. Great... then I get an email saying the price difference is now $1 more all of a sudden. I text back Grubhub, they apologize and said it was the restaurant charging more for some reason and they re-adjust the price again to what it's suppose to be. Well we get the order only after the lady is INCREDIBLY RUDE... aaaaaand it's the first order that was wrong AND we got shorted on one of the rolls. Needless to say, we will not be back. Such a disappointment."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Man this place is good! So fresh, consistent quality, and such nice staff. Nice interior, and Mr Fish is always there to great you. The only thing that could make it better would be a larger selection of special rolls, but that's just my greed talking!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"This was my first time trying sushi and it was overall a good experience. The food matches the vibe of the place, and I'll definitely be back for seconds!! The customer service was really good, and the owner was really nice and taught me how to use chop sticks. Made me feel very welcomed."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,This place is alright. Definitely over priced I got 2 rolls for 22$ a crunchy roll and a California. It was decent sushi for Santa Barbra. They made it super fast to go around 15 mins. And they had seating outside as well:)
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"It pains me to give this 2 star review but this place has gone downhill since I moved here in 2016.  I've given it lots of tries and each time it gets a little bit less great.  Went about a month ago, outdoor dining.  Sticky tables, the papers taped under the tables are covered in soy sauce and old stains and need to be removed.  The soy sauce dishes have a permanent brown ring around the edge and the glasses were completely filthy!  The bathroom was absolutely foul as well.  The entire restaurant just had a funky smell and I was nauseous after going to the bathroom for the rest of the night.  Didn't want to touch anything in there.  Some of the fish did also not taste fresh and came out straight up warm.  Alas, after being my favorite place I no longer will be visiting.  It really needs a complete decor overhaul, all new serveware, a dishwasher upgrade and a complete bathroom remodel.  Need to check the fridges and ventilation.  Super bummed.  Not sure what happened here."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"After several recommendations from locals, I decided to give Ichiban a try. The nigiri's were very good, nice sake, japanese scallop. The scallop was maybe the best thing I had all night. Also had uni nigiri which was ok...feel like it could have been fresher...didn't have that same ocean brinyness.  Also got the caterpillar role which was pretty tasty.

I ordered kama as well and it took probably 45 minutes to come out for some reason. And the hamachi didn't taste as fresh or maybe because it was overcooked. I wondered if that was to mask the freshness? It was just ok at best which was unfortunate, because a well cooked kama can melt in your mouth and this felt like eating canned tuna.

Lastly, price was also ok...a bit pricey for the locale being a neighborhood restaurant and the quality being a bit hit or miss."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Great spot with quality food.  Sushi and donburri are some of my favorites. Small strip mall location. Service is spotty, but acceptable.Enjoy!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Cool little sushi place great service all the employees were fast and friendly as well. I ordered ahead to pick up and all the employees asked if I had been helped. They were all fast efficient friendly and professional.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I honestly only found this place because of their Groupon deal ($40 worth of food for $20, party of 4). Otherwise, I probably would've never visited.

We came here for dinner on a Sunday night, on my way back to campus. It's located on a weird one way street that runs parallel to the main Cliff Drive. Not a lot of parking, but we were able to get a spot. The inside was relatively empty, there were a few patrons. Not loud at all. We opted to sit on the mats and low table, which was interesting. 

We ordered the 007 rolls, tempura udon, pork ramen, tonkatsu donburi, and California roll with tempura. The sushi here was pretty good. The katsu was also nice. But the noodle soups were lacking. There were not enough noodles in the udon to justify the price (higher than LA). The ramen and pork was very salty. 

Service was okay, the waitresses were very nice. There was an 18% gratuity tacked on the end of our bill. Kind of odd, but I guess they have to make a living somehow. 

It's not the best sushi place, but it's one of their better choices. Steer away from the noodles. I would definitely take advantage of that Groupon deal, it's not really worth the price otherwise."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I'm bumping this place up to 5 stars.

The rolls are so tasty and fresh here. I had a bite and looked at my roll and thought, these are like the Sees candy of sushi rolls.Service is always good and I keep coming back."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We looked at the check and did a ""can this be right?"" double take. It was very inexpensive for what we got. 

The lunch specials are the way to go here...they give you a lot of good food for very little money. We also ordered another roll thinking that there wouldn't be enough. Wrong!  The rolls tended to fall apart but those chopsticks can pick anything up. Nice and attentive service too.

I would def come here again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"The front desk lady really ruined this place for me. I went in about 30 minutes before their midday break and literally stood in front of the receptionist for about 5 minutes. I finally asked her if she would seat us and she said WELL WE ARE CLOSING SOON. I don't care! I'm here before closing so seat me. She said WELL CAN YOU EAT ALL YOUR FOOD FAST BEFORE WE CLOSE?  What the heck! Of course I told her ya and then I took my sweet time. The food was good and the older workers were very nice, it was just that young receptionist. They even serve big meals in like an old school boat, yes a boat made as a plate. It was cool. They also have tables to sit at and then a section where you can sit on the floor and eat on a lowered table with cushions."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,I love this place! The sushi is DELICIOUS!! They also have a spicy edamame that is the best. The service is always great. The staff is always very nice and I'm never waiting too long. One of the best sushi places in town!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"As a resident on the Mesa, Ichiban is very close and convenient for me. I liked that we were able get seated on the outside patio immediately and that they are pet friendly. I also like that they have an Axxess deal! The service was very good. We were greeted and checked on several times. The staff was very personable and friendly in conversation. All food items were plated nicely, and the hand rolls were packed with toro. However, I was displeased with being charged for an extra miso soup, when my meal included one, but not a deal breaker. I was disappointed with the portion of the shrimp and vegetable tempura, still not a deal breaker. Ultimately, I was dissatisfied with the quality and freshness of the fish-deal breaker. Particularly, My tuna sashimi and toro hand roll, both seemed cheap by the texture and flavor. Unfortunate because these are typically my favorites. I most likely will not return, due to several other quality and consistent sushi options in town."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I have no clue where all the 5 stars are coming from on this place. 

It's so hard for me to believe that in a fish town like Santa Barbara, there is such a lack of good, reasonably priced sushi restaurants. 

No, Arigato doesn't count...it's not that great and it's horribly over priced. 

Ichiban is good because there's nothing else to really compare it to here. It's definitely not great and the prices for nigiri sushi are expensive. An order of tuna nigiri is over $6.00! If I want an order of tuna, yellowtail and salmon -- that's 6 pieces of sushi -- I'm already over $20.00! C'mon now! 

The other thing that bothers me is the older sushi chef -- he's rude. I've been here twice now and both times he's acted almost offended when I place another order for sushi and he has felt that I've already eaten a lot. I'm sorry, do you not want my cash? Is the point of your business not to make money?

This trip, I ordered: 1 tuna sushi, 1 yellowtail sushi, 1 spicy scallop hand roll and 1 spider roll. When I placed an order for a Cliff Roll the chef responded with: ""oh you're sure hungry tonight...this will be your last roll."" Excuse me?! I'm not some obese dude shoveling food into my mouth. I'll keep ordering until I'm done eating! Maybe if you actually filled my scallop hand roll and sliced the nigiri a little thicker, I wouldn't have the need to order another roll. 

This was the second time he was this rude to me and it sure isn't making me want to come back for a third visit. 

The other servers were attentive and pleasant. The older sushi chef is rude and should just learn to keep to the task of assembling mediocre rolls and keep his mouth shut. 

2-stars: ""Meh. I've experienced better."""
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,I just finished a meal here with my family and was extremely impressed by the service. The staff were very attentive (our waiter especially) and checked on us often. The food was amazing; I recommend the Uni (Sea Urchin) if you're feeling adventurous. It's locally caught in Santa Barbara.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I love coming to Ichiban for sushi lunch and sitting at their low tables with my shoes off. The waitstaff is very attentive and sweet to my children. The portions are perfect, pricing is right about average. Menu is standard. Its a nice place to have a great lunch.

Dinner however leaves something to be desired. There is a totally different vibe there at dinner time that I don't enjoy so I've only been there twice for dinner."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Omg, the Japanese waitress in this restaurant is so rude and disrespectful to customers. The worst restaurant service experience I have ever had! Definitely don't go there!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"The donburi are disappointing... Pork and chicken. We ordered the pork donburi first but the pork was tough and sinewy. We sent it back and ask for chicken donburi hoping it will be better. It's not. The chicken was pre-grilled and rather dry... You are suppose to simmer the raw chicken in the sauce so it will soak up the sauce! 

The quality of the sushi was ok. However, it's way over priced...

Overall, not recommending this restaurant and we will not go back again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Do you not ever come here! I got the worst food poisoning of my life! I did up going to the hospital they told me that there was worms.
I called the shack to tell them just in case for future reference and in the shed started yelling at me over the phone. 
I do wish I could give this I Stabley Schmidt zero stars because of how I was treated in the illnesses I received. If you're on the way to go eat here right now I really hope you reconsider."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Pre-lockdown review: Ichiban has been my go-to sushi place in Santa Barbara for as long as I can remember. From lunch combinations to nigiri specials, it has always satisfied my sushi cravings. The 007 roll is the best!

The restaurant is nicely decorated and there are plenty of tables to sit at. The bar is especially convenient if you're looking for a quick bite. The owners and sushi chefs are pretty sociable. I see new waiters every time I visit, but it has never altered my positive experience."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Amazing service and absolutely outstanding food. I got to sit in the small booths without my shoes and it was surprisingly very pleasant. I will come back here forever
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,Would give no stars If I could. I've never been here before and had terrible customer service!!!! Waited a long time for someone to greet and help me. It wasn't like they were busy. Then when the lady came to me and asked what I wanted she then walked away as I was still speaking. Clearly she didn't want my business so I won't be coming back.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"This used to be on of my fave sushi restaurants in SB. But over the last year the food quality has gone down. We have a few servers that we love & a handful of new ones. Service has been hit or miss, so if we go, we try to go when we know whose working."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Good food and good lunch combos (about $10 each and includes rice, miso soup, and a few other sides).

Originally gave this place 5 stars based on the lunch combo price, but updated after getting their rolls.

If you're looking for rolls, I recommend Goleta Sushi House. Their rolls are about the same price but twice as big."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Kim Cameron, Valencia, CA
This is my favorite Sushi Restaurant in Santa Barbara!!! I've been there countless times. If you are going for the first time, make sure you get the Box Sushi (this one is my FAVORITE, but be careful, it can be really spicy). I also like the Dragon Roll, Caterpillar Roll, Avocado Eel Roll, Rainbow Roll, Edamame, everything on the Sailor Boat (Miso Soup, Salad, Gyoza [aka: pot stickers], Shrimp, Tempura, Teriyaki Chicken, CA Roll). I love the house ginger salad dressing too. 
Note: There was a time I got the Box Sushi and it was WAY too hot! I love spicy too, but I found that the chefs were inconsistent in this manner. A couple other times it was not spicy enough. most of the time, however, it was just right! This is why I subtracted a star from their overall score."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I've been here a handful of times and I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed it. Well, I'm making amends now!

The first time I came, I came alone, when I was interviewing for my current job, at the recommendation of a friend who used to live here. I sat at the sushi bar and had a nice relaxing evening.

I introduced another friend here, and it was good. So good, she's practically a regular here. We came again tonight and one of the ladies already had a pile of ginger that she gave to my friend. 

Tonight we had the Spider roll, Caterpillar roll, spicy tuna, spicy scallop and a salmon roll. I also had a miso soup, as my friend kept talking about making miso, and I was starving, so it was a nice opening to the meal.

The fish was fresh and tonight's favorite for me was the salmon roll. It is a basic roll with salmon and avocado. Can we just say ""YUM?!"" The salmon was awesome and there was just the right amount of avocado in every bite. 

Second up was definitely the Caterpillar roll. Clearly, I'm a fan of avocado, but this was just so good! The other rolls were pretty good, but didn't stand out as much as the two that I just described.

I enjoyed the miso as well. I don't know why I don't come more often. Something tells me that that's about to change!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I've been here twice, both experiences have been poor. The service is average, but waited quite a while for my meal. However, it gets one star because of the food. I ordered the fish here, and what I got after waiting 25 minutes was a bland and soggy excuse for a meal. The side salad was not fresh at all. Some of the lettuce leaves were brown...very unappetizing. Miso soup did not have any tofu or onions in it, but tasted okay."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I love this place. Been here many times and never left a review.

Everyone is so kind and the food is always delicious. Just a great place for everything Japanese."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"One of the favorite places where we like to spend time with our family. Friendly waiters, quick service, excellent menu! We recommend"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I've been coming here since I was very young - a family experience. The owner knows me and is always friendly, love that they have quality food at an affordable price. Check out the lunch specials, you get a ton of food. Not necessarily a fancy sushi bar, but it does well for what it offers."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I have to agree with the reviewer who thought the food was ""mushy"". I had the California Roll ($6), the ""007 Roll"" ($11.50), and Fresh Albacore ($6). I really cannot recommend any of these. They may have all suffered from mushy rice. This is the first and last time I will eat here. I'll stick with Arigato on State St where I am always pleased with the food."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I have a soft spot in my heart for this place, probably because I have been going  for 15 years.
Great neighborhood spot, a little on the pricey side.

I love their hamachi and masago with green onions and they have some interesting rolls - box sushi is awesome, ginger is too. The spicy edamame isn't too spicy and is really good."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I knew this was a budget sushi joint on the Mesa forever. I went because I paid for a massage with a woman who had no availability (thanks Gov Hair Product for closing again in a county nothing like LAC). 

So I had some credit and bought 20 for 10. Didn't realize you have to have two people. 

Fish inedible. Except yellowtail. Terrible, terrible fish and subpar rice. Even the hot sake horrible. 

The lettuce tasted bad too. 

I am sure the cooked food is adequate but no, never again. 

P.S. there is a clump of cold mashed potato with carrot on sushi lunch combo. I have no idea why."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,This is the worst place I have been to in my life. I've never had a chef come up to me and tell me that I was wrong about the order that I placed. I came for lunch today and ordered the lunch special sushi boat. I told the server that I was allergic to shrimp and in that case I cannot have the shrimp in the boat and to substitute it out with anything like tuna and salmon. But after making that comment I told her that I was also allergic to all shellfish so if you need any of other substitution it would have to be efficient with scales. I also ordered a rainbow roll and told her the same substitutions because of my allergies. They brought up both of the orders. The boat which contained shrimp was substituted for octopus. The octopus is also shellfish. In the rainbow roll there was regular shrimp even though we were told them otherwise. After informing our waitress she took back the food. But moments later the chef came from behind the bar and started yelling at us. I have never felt so offended. I left hungry. 10/10 do NOT recommend.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Food here is absolutely FIRE. the crunchy roll is delicious and so is the avocado roll. just wow. AMAZING FOOD AND AMAZING SERVICE.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Great friendly staff and good food. Inexpensive and fresh. We will definitely be back.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"The aura of great authenticity that Ichiban surpasses is beyond me. From the darling Japanese styled seating area, to the swords decorating the entryway, Ichiban is the most authentic Japanese dining experience I've had in Santa Barbara.

THE STAFF- 

The first few times I visited here I would use either an Axxess deal or a Groupon and the way the waitress would calculate the receipt would always be off by a few $$. I do think businesses should honor their deals, and it's a shame on their part because it would have been five stars.

Other than receipt miscalculations for deals, their staff are very quick and insightful, I'm never having to track down a waiter or if I'm at the Sushi bar, I never feel like I'm pressed for time.

THE FOOD- 

Lately I've been begining my sushi endeavours with fresh-water eel ($8.00) sashimi or nigiri, and it always falls palatable to the start of my meal.

I really enjoy their Mesa roll ($12.95), 007 roll ($13.95), and their mouthwatering Chef Special roll ($18.75). All of them come with a lot of spicy mayo so there's really no need to ask for a side of it. 

---------------------------------------------------

Ichiban is one of the best Japanese restaurants in SB, in terms of food quality, and real Japanese authenticity. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Yikes!  I've never had sushi that actually tasted rotten, until here.  And then the chefs insisted it was fresh?  I've never left sushi on my plate, but I was not willing to go back for a second bite.  
Interior booths are sweet. The young blond server was adorable with great service. Hope he finds a better restaurant!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We had great, prompt service and delicious rolls! Ichiban is a place that has a minimal amount of specialty rolls and a bunch of nigiri and sushi rolls. I love that their fish tastes fresh! We ordered the Cliff Roll, the Ichiba Roll, the Lobster Roll, the Yelllowtail roll, and Albacore Nigiri! All of the rolls were so good! Super bummed they didn't have Toro!"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I went here because of a Groupon I had bought, after a late morning kayak around the harbor with my boyfriend. I liked how spaced out the tables were and the service was excellent. We ordered the Fisherman Boat (which we later realized was actually two boats), and it was nice and satisfying. The Dynamite that came with the second boat was probably my favorite part. It would've been nice to have rice come with the second boat since it has both chicken teriyaki and the dynamite, but we just ordered it separately as a side. Overall, pretty decent food, but nothing that stood out in particular."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Wanted a change of scenery and we were on Cliff Drive so we tried Ichiban based on the recent reviews which were all 4 stars. That rating is about right. Some dishes were a little greasier than should have been (short ribs and the tempura apples), but that's my fault for choosing those dishes in the first place. Their spicy sauces are indeed...really spicy. The spicy edamame with garlic is unique and on point. The ""box sushi"" is also a unique dish and came out spicier than expected (probably also because they drizzled siracha on the sides. The short ribs were $19, more than they should have been. I may or may not come back, and if I do I'll only repeat the edamame again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,This sushi restaurant is seating both inside and out. Wonderful service. Excellent selection of both fish and vegetable options. Don't forget dessert! Red bean ice cream tempura was to die for. We'll definitely be back. I can't tell you what took us so long to get here.
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,Change your hours on Google! We walked in at 9:15 and felt very unwelcomed!  Employees only gave us the option for take out! If your kitchen closes at 9:30 then please update your hours  because on-line it states this restaurant closes at 10pm! Not a pleasant experience!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Very disappointed in my overall experience. Why on earth would anyone serve pickled ginger with artificial sweetener? Maybe I'm the only person in the world who has an extreme distaste for artificial sweetness, but my taste buds are ruined. I wish I had read the unfavorable reviews before we went. But this sealed the deal that I will never go there again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I ordered take-out:
 -hamachi nigiri  4/4
 -shrimp tempura roll 3.5/4
 -CA roll 2.5/4 because it had krab/surimi-there wasn't an option to upgrade to snow crab. 
Overall this place is pretty good. The quality of the hamachi was on par with what i order from arigato."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"I don't want to start off by saying I had a terrible experience, as I really did enjoy the environment that this restaurant presents. It is a cozy sushi bar and restaurant nestled in the Mesa shopping strip. It is usually very festive with the holidays (they had decorated the area really nicely for Valentine's day when I went), and it feels like a nice local place to grab sushi.

But.. I just have to say the sushi was just not fresh. There are not a lot of places to compare to in terms of sushi served in Santa Barbara, but with my experience of sushi, this just felt disappointing. My friend and I both had the rainbow rolls (what we tend to order at sushi restaurants we haven't been to before just to get a taste of a variety of the fish they have to offer), and the shrimp was probably the most disappointing. The salmon also did not tasting fresh as well.. itdid not effect me the next day, but my friend had to stay home from work because he was certain the fish had affected him. 

I'm not necessarily saying this is a terrible establishment, I think it's worth at least trying, but I personally was not that impressed with the sushi served."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"We had been missing sushi, since we hadn't had it in 8 months, since the pandemic started. We love Ichiban, but don't have any interest in sitting outside by the parking strip to enjoy it. We just felt it wasn't worth the risk of exposure.

So, we ordered a big sushi feast for takeout and brought it home. 

Everything looked beautiful and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I hate pickled ginger and they put big chunks of it in every dish we ordered and the ginger juice was sopped up by the rice in every roll or nigiri sushi we ordered. There was no way to get away from all the nasty pickled ginger juice in the bottom of the containers.

Next time, I'll ask for them not to put any ginger in the containers at all."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"This sweet little neighborhood sushi place is truly Ichiban (""Number One"") with us. Their fish always tastes amazingly fresh and delicate, the rice is perfect, their miso soup hits the spot. We especially enjoy their sushi combination, tempura and sashimi. Their service is always prompt and attentive. They are also very diligent about Covid health guidelines, and I look forward to the time when we all can dine-in there again safely."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,negative,"Tuna sashimi..poor quality and old fishy taste, probably kept too long or buying from secondary source"
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Very authentic Japanese restaurant. Unfortunately, I've gone to many mediocre Japanese restaurants. However, Ichiban truly is number one (Ichiban is number one in Japanese) for the Santa Barbara area. Being Japanese and raised in a Japanese culture and around Japanese food I know what good Japanese food is."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"Excellent and fresh spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll. Mom ate shrimp and veggie tempura plate. Yummy, yummy! Crowded for Monday night but it is spring break week. Very nice ambiance. Warm greeting when entering the establishment. I would eat here again."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"BEFORE READING: they currently have a few deals on Groupon going on that are pretty awesome! I bought $20 dine-in during lunch credit for $12.

Came here for the first time with my boyfriend for lunch to use that voucher. He was having a bad day and said he was immediately cheered up with the food. The lunch combos are great--you get a bunch of great food plus miso soup and rice for about $10!

Came again for our anniversary dinner and had another great experience. The servers were always checking in on us and the food came out quickly. 

Only problem is parking--it's street parking but all the businesses on this street share a small stretch of available parking. I got lucky both times I was here but I'm not sure where I would park if it was packed."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"I ate at the sushi bar with a couple of friends. We simply ate what the older chef recommended. The sushi was all excellent, even though a bit pricey for me. I'll definitely be back."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"This place is great! I recently had their Volcano roll and I couldn't get it in my mouth fast enough--YUM. They have a pretty simple menu, which makes deciding much easier than the sushi places with epic lists of special rolls. Excellent quality fish. Good service."
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,Very cute outdoor seating area.  Staff is very nice and service prompt.  Nice menu also well done w attention to detail.  Food looks awesome as well.  This is a great little place yum!
kZtl_NJjUnlIQgzFrBhXyQ,Ichiban,Japanese,positive,"This is a take out review on a Thursday night 5/20/21. Whoa good sushi... I felt the love in how you prepared the sushi! Thank you thank you thank you it has HIT my sushi craving out of the park! I used grub hub to order. I highly highly recommend the salmon sushi, octopus and seared tuna sushi and I got like 4-5 different rolls split among three ppl.... all very good and the descriptions were accurate. I am full like a good year blimp of quality sushi obviously prepared with love and I ain't ordering another sushi place when I'm in the area... please be here next year when I'm here for my annual trip! THANK YOU Ichiban I felt the love in how you made the sushi so well and it hit the spot!!!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Ordered the make your own poke bowl and noodle soup. Can definitely say the seafood is fresh and portions are reasonable for the poke bowl although the taste itself was slightly bland personally. Also, I'm glad that there's another place in IV that serves good noodles soups now :)"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Although $15 seems steep, they really pack the bowl to the top, they don't skimp on fish, and the flavor was perfect. Very quick prep and delivery! Will buy again."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"I'm really happy a new poke place opened in IV. I like PokeCeviche but Poke Theory is a LOT closer and the quality is better. The fish is fresh and most of the employees are pretty nice and patient. The portions are also well worth ~$13. You can also get a free drink if you make your own bowl! I tried the lychee rose; it was pretty bomb but a bit on the sweet side if that's your thing. The ONLY reason I'm not giving the full five stars is because of the overall seasoning. Some items are a bit bland and could benefit from more salt or pepper. There's an option to add salt at the end so I'd be interested to try that and see :) The shop is still new, though, so I know things can only get better! I hope this place sticks around for a long time and I'll certainly be back :)"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,negative,It was good but I ordered the Crunchy and got shrimp instead of tuna so I'm a little disappointed:/ I guess check your bowl before you leave to make sure they didn't get it wrong.
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Came here for the first time and it was great! Bella who took our orders was super accommodating. It's a lil pricey but the the price point was worth it for the great service.
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Awesome poke and interior decorationeach bowl's gonna fill u up good. Give it a try if you are around
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Great customer service and poke! Went for the soft opening and got a free lychee drink too. Really liked the decor and atmosphere. Also, got to try different sauces before deciding which was cool."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"The workers are super nice and friendly the second you walk into the store. They are happy to help walk you through the steps of building your own bowl and they allow you to try samples of their sauces. The store has plenty of seating, so you can either eat there or to go. There is a nice selection of fish and proteins, and the portion sizes are good for its price. I definitely recommend trying to build your own poke bowl. However if you dont like raw fish that much, this place also carries udon and ramen, but I have yet to try their soups.

(p.s. their lychee rose drink is really good, but on the sweet side if that is what you like)"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,The people here are so sweet and they're so enthusiastic about helping you out and letting you try anything to make sure you like it. I'm excited to try this poke bowl!!
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,negative,The environment is nice but quite narrow. There's not enough people to serve and the soup tastes terrible. The price is too high for the overall quality.
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Large, quality bowls at a good price! I was very impressed with the amount of actual poke I received for the wonderful price I paid. Overall in terms of quality, it was definitely more than satisfactory. Definitely a 4 out of 5!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,I've lived in Goleta for 8 years. This place is awesome!! We've been waiting for a great Poke shop. I'm not sure when they opened but we went there about a month or so ago and were blown away!!
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Very generous portions!  Fish was fresh and delicious.  Great flavors.  Service was quick and friendly.  Would go back for sure!
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Amazing place, amazing people!  Delicious lychee rose water (Must Try),  very fresh ingredients for your poke bowl!!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Best poke in IV hands down. The fish is fresh and much better quality than pokeceviche. Haven't tried their drinks, but the purple one looks beautiful! Also the workers are super sweet and friendly. I tip them every time."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Unfortunately, my order got messed up (I'm vegan), and there was the masago (fish egg) added, but I called them, and they gave me a full refund! Great customer service in general. They're very friendly.

As for the food I got to try, I was amazed by the appearance of the soy beef (I mean, look at it! Looks so real). As for the taste of the soy beef & shreds (chicken), I would suggest for them to dry them out and perhaps marinate them because the texture was really spongy, but it lacked any sense of flavor.

Not mention, everything that was in my food was SUPER fresh... the veggies, radish, rice, beets, jalapeño, cucumber, literally EVERY thing. I just wish the vegan meats had more flavor. 

This was a regular $13.95 bowl, and the portion was great. It's perfect for sharing with another person! 

I also highly recommend the sweet shoyu sauce as well."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"The best poke place in IV!

Cost: 12.95 for a medium bowl (3 scoops) 

Food: My friend and I each got a medium bowl. It was JAMMED with toppings and I felt like I definitely got my money's worth. First scoop of seaweed salad, crab salad and masago were free. There was a wide variety of toppings and the toppings were fresh. They had fresh seaweed as a topping choice which is dope. They also had a cool option for sauce where you could get it on the fish, the rice or both. This is a great choice for people who like heavy sauce (like me). 

This place often has freebies. When we went, they offered us a free soup or drink. 

Drink: We got a free cup of lychee rose and the galaxy lemonade. Both are pretty colors and very Insta worthy. The lychee rose tastes how it sounds. It's a nice balance between sweet and light. The galaxy lemonade was ok. It had a tangy kick but the ""galaxy"" part didn't provide much of a flavor to me. 

Atmosphere: Servers were super friendly! They had pieces of paper where you circled the choices and handed them the paper rather than telling them what you wanted. Unsure if that's how it always was or if it was due to precautions for COVID-19. 

Location: Next to Spudnuts Donuts in IV! Easy access for students on the go, in between classes and etc. 

Improvements: The sauces could be more flavorful and spicier."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Best Poke in IV based on this particular (regular sized bowl) order.

- Ingredients taste fresh and are all of decent quality: green onions were cut 
  very uniformly!
- Sauce and fish are pretty good
- Not the best poke I've ever tried all time (compared to OC/Bay area) BUT 
  Poke Theory SB stands out in IV its for consistency of quality"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Ordered 2 create your own poke bowls through the website - super easy to navigate and customize! Two regular bowls were $12.95 each, with avocado it was an extra dollar. They also came with free drinks so I got the Galaxy Lemonade and Lychee Rose. Both were super light and refreshing, perfect with the fish. The portion size was filling, the fish tasted fresh and the sauces were good. My only complaint is we ordered white rice only as the base and it was too much. Next time i'd get half rice, half salad.

I'll definitely come back to try the noodles!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,The service was very good and they were very patient and gracious with their servings! I don't usually eat a lot of poke but it's a great place for college students and I hope to be able to visit again :)
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Awesome bowls. Reasonable prices. Fish was definitely fresh. Will come back soon. Friendly employees. Better than Poke Ceviche or Choppa Poke in my opinion.
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Great for fast takeout!

This restaurant is located in the heart of IV.  Parking on the street nearby can be tough but if you live close, it's a nice walk.   Poke  Theory is a somewhat small restaurant with simple yet modern decor. There was no outdoor seating.  Indoor dining was closed due to Covid-19.

I called in my order for 2 custom regular size bowls and was told it would be ready in 5-10 minutes. When I arrived, I was glad to see that good Covid-19 safety measures were in place.  Pick up was easy and my food was nicely packaged up and ready to go.  

Portion size was good and the food was tasty.  As a vegetarian, I chose both the tofu and soy shreds for my protein.  Next time I visit, I'll opt for just tofu.  For the other bowl, an opt out of scallops next time was noted.  

Pricing was standard for a poke bowl place.  

Customer service was outstanding.  The female who assisted over the phone and in person was super sweet and helpful.  

I would visit again."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"So happy to have a good poke spot. They have build your own bowls, ramen, and fun drinks. The sauces are really unique and they let you sample them if you want to. It's a really enjoyable spot worth checking out!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"First time trying poke again in years because I don't like raw fish, and it was delicious! You can get up to 10 sides which is really filling. There wasn't as much fish as I expected, but there was a huge scoop of imitation crab which was delicious. Would come back again and also try other poke places, which is really saying something!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Ok this is my dinning hall. I have it every week and the proteins are fresh. Like the sauce as well. Only cons: quite a long wait.
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Great customer service and great food! Definitely come back! Free 1 scoop on final week!
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,wait line was quite short and food was ready within less than 7 mins. overall food was delicious and had a lot of options to chose from. would definitely recommend if you are looking for a good poke place! i loved it. :)
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Really great food and service, plus they have giant portions! Definitely recommend going here"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Really awesome customer service! Im glad that theres a new poke shop here. Got to try the sauces before i got to choose them!
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"I decided to go here because my friends told me about it and said really good things about it and they were right this place is FANTASTIC. The staff was really nice and professional. I got a large bowl with Seared abacore, white rice, and many other things. The fish was so fresh it seemed like they just caught the fish! The rice was freshly made, and the vegetables are very fresh and good. Along with my food I decided to get the galaxy lemonade and it was so tasty and looked cool especially because they had good edible glitter!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,poke is my favorite food and i was so bummed that there weren't any GOOD poke places in iv:( but now i can happily say that i will be spending all my money at this place. phenomenal.
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"I ordered the Poke Theory bowl through delivery. It was overpriced! The regular bowl was about $17. There wasn't many fish, but there were a lot of rice and toppings instead. The bowl tasted good with the green aioli and house sauce."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"This place gets 5 stars for several reasons:  size (for the bowl size, it was filling), taste (the sauces enhanced and didn't overpower the food), freshness, and service.   I'm visiting the area and chose this place bc of it's photos, protein choices, toppings, and pricing that aligns with poke places in LA.  I ordered online from my hotel just under 3 miles away, and I forgot to choose sauces.  Poke sauces are one characteristic of eating poke that makes each place and bowl unique.  I got there, and the chef came out and asked if it was intentional that I left out the sauces.   Service is what gave this place the fifth star. They were warm, friendly, and excited for me hoping I enjoyed my food.  

Because I forgot to add sauce, they gave me some to try on the side.  The spicy mayo was nice bc it added creaminess and a little heat to the dish. Both the sweet shoyu and orangy garlic enhanced the flavors and freshness of the proteins and veggie toppings while being a great accompaniment to my salad and rice base.    Toppings really help the over-all experience.  No soy sauce needed at all.  

Finally, the five proteins that go into a large bowl were the bigger winner.  Poke is hard to commit to sometimes for the price, but once you find a spot like this, it deserves to be ""the place"".  If I lived here or when I visit again, I will absolutely come here again and wish them the best.  Good luck not eating the large bowl at once bc the flavors are so good.  Best wishes for continued success for this place.  I enjoyed the bowl a bunch."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Best poke place I've been to. Highly recommended better than poke ceviche. Taste very fresh and I enjoy the look of the inside. I wouldn't go anywhere else in Goleta, have tried poke in sb yet."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Hands down the best poke place in IV! The portions fill you up, the fish tastes super fresh, the toppings are generous, and the sauces are great! My personal favorites are the orange garlic (OG), the green aioli, and the sweet shoyu. I like how they let you sample as many sauces as you want before picking, and you can also mix sauces together! I personally like mixing the OG and sweet shoyu. Using the Yelp check-in offer, I was able to try their galaxy lemonade and lychee rose drink for free! The galaxy lemonade was kind of bland tbh but the lychee rose was delicious! The rose water wasn't overpowering at all and it was the perfect level of sweetness. It reminded me of the juice that's in the lychee jelly cups, so I definitely recommend! In addition to the great food, the service here has been exceptional every time I've went. The staff are patient and always willing to give samples of stuff and suggestions if you need them! I haven't tried other stuff on their menu yet but if you're craving poke this is a solid choice!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Poke Theory has successfully filled in the void that PokiRito left when it closed down. The portions are generous and the service is outstanding. I will definitely be stopping by again and highly recommend this spot to anyone!
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"The people here are so sweet and they're so enthusiastic about helping you out and letting you try anything to make sure you like it. I'm excited to try this bowl!

EDIT (5/15): They have great safety/cleanliness measures in place while they're still open during COVID-19!! You write your order on a paper (they provide gloves) and have the cash register at the door so you don't have to go in and potentially contaminate the inside since it's fresh food. Then you wait outside, and they gave a free lychee rose drink!!!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"By far the best poke place in Santa Barbara. Fresh, flavorful, with such a great deal. The bowls were so big, at such a low price, that I was able to have two meals. The free item is also a def plus. The employee was also very sweet, kind, and social! Overall, great place and should be your go to place for poke!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Me and my friend were wandering around town and ended up coming in here.. SO HAPPY!!! im writing this review while im eating this amazing customized poke bowl because you get a free drink if you check in on yelp June and Bella are so nice and very welcoming, very clean and positive space to eat good food and drink yummy drinks with nice people, will be coming back atleast once a week"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,This place is great! I've been here a couple times now and the couple working there are always nice and professional. As a vegan it was INCREDIBLY EASY to eat here; there are a ton of vegan options including a vegan beef and chicken shred which not only are tasty but very filling too. 10/10!
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,Great service for my first time there and the lychee rose drink is too good!! As well as many and fresh selections :)
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Best poke in the area! The protein is always fresh and there are so many options for toppings. Their portions are also very generous! Highly recommend! Also, Bella is the sweetest and always ready to help!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"For IV, this place is pretty good!! The have larger bowls than PokeCeviche for the same price (although it is filled with a lot of rice) as well as a variety of noodle soup options, making this a pretty good place to eat! They also have a large size for poke bowls if you'd like. Their customer service was super nice and they gave a good portion of food too.

The fish was tasty and they had a large variety of really tasty toppings and sauces, however, my only complaint was that the sauces weren't salty enough. My bowl was kind of bland so I needed a lot of soy sauce to add taste, but I really liked the flavor of their sauces!! 

The rose lychee was also a very unique addition to the menu! Although it tastes just like pure syrup, it was really pretty (and free with a check in)! I prefer PokeCeviche's lychee slushy because the ice dilutes the syrup a bit more. I also had a sip of the galaxy lemonade, but I didn't enjoy it because it just tasted like a sugary Minute Maid lemonade. I probably would not spend money on their drinks but I'd definitely come back for their bowls, and to try more of their sauces!!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Wonderful spot. Many options, generous portions. My online order was 100% correct. I appreciated that seaweed salad was available as a free topping."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Delicious! Fish quality blows poke ceviche out of the water.  So excited to finally have a delicious poke place in IV.  The amount of protein that you get for the price is very impressive.  The fish is in nice big chunks, and the sauces are all super fun and unique.  I enjoyed the 'cilantro miso' sauce quite a bit.  There are a myriad of toppings to choose from, and there are also some noodle dishes that I am eager to come back and try.  My friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant, and the owner offered us some delicious off-menu tuna nigiri that her husband had made in the back.  WOW! It was so delicious.  That's the kind of service that I love.  Definitely making this my weekly poke place."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,This is my new favorite poke bowl in isla vista. The meat is very fresh - this is the best point. It's become my top choice for lunch when I'm in campus.
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Really good poke bowl just a bit overpriced. Got spicy tuna, shrimp, and yellowtail with spicy Mayo and house aioli. Love the crunchys they put on top too!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"Fresh ingredients and really friendly service!! I got the poke bowl and I was really happy with the fish. Their sauces are also super tasty, and they let you sample the sauces. 

The only thing is that although the ingredients were all high quality, altogether it felt a little underseasoned. Maybe the sauces need a little more salt? They do give the option of adding salt and pepper at the end so I think I'll do that next time. I'll definitely be back though, and I'm so glad this place opened!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"The customer service was great! They gave my sick friend a free water bottle. The poke was quality, but wish the rice was warm."
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,So glad there is a new and good poke spot in IV! The staff was so kind and they have great safety measures for COVID. I was surprised at how large the regular bowl is and the variety of options for toppings they have. Sauces were great and everything was fresh! Definitely coming back.
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! a little expensive since it is seafood but AMAZING!! WAY BETTER than poke ceviche! You get to pick up to 10 toppings and can pick up to 4 sauces, and have 5 different fish for a large. This is a really good deal! Only a couple dollars more and you get a great deal! This is my all time favorite place to eat and the employees are so sweet. They don't complain and they are there to do their job and give 100% customer satisfaction. I came at closing and I could tell they were stressed with all the customers that were in line but they were not complaining. They did their job thoroughly well and still make the food taste delicious. Every sauce I got on side was labeled and presentation for the poke bowl was perfect!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"I love a good poke bowl, and have tried several places in SB. We ordered through Door Dash and were really impressed with our bowls. Good portion, super fresh tasting ingredients and nice and saucy the way I like ;-)
Pretty pricy when you have it delivered ($50+ for 2 small sized bowls) but enough food to enjoy for 2 days. I do wish the actual container size was bigger so you can move things around better but other than that 5 stars"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"best restaurant in iv!!! food is fresh and delicious and they take covid regulations seriously--you fill out a menu outside and give it to the employee inside, they provide plastic gloves and hand sanitizer. the employees are very nice also! ive eaten here 5 times and have 0 complaints. seriously one of the best poke places around"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,negative,"There's a lot to enjoy about this place! They made some mistakes with my order however, and I feel as though the quality could be better.

Food: I like how they have pre-made bowls available but also the variety of choices to create your own. They forgot to put cucumbers and fried garlic in my bowl however, the crabmeat is a little dry, the rice is also quite clumpy and the fish portion was a bit small. In addition, I can't taste any sauce. I did come at the last hour though so could totally be end of the day mishap. The quality of the rest of the ingredients was still pretty good and I like how they have Nori. The matcha kiwi drink is also to die for!

Service: Besides messing up my order, they're really nice and very timely with the orders so this made up for other cons.

Overall, not the best experience but would still come again as the food was still delicious regardless!"
RIXWht1pZG8pe1SJk5hhXw,Poke Theory SB,Japanese,positive,"I've gotten poke here three times now and all times have been wonderful. Two were on doordash and everything was delivered perfectly, but I was really impressed with the one time I ordered in store. 

This place takes COVID seriously, and I really appreciate them for that. They have a fill out menu outside where you can circle/write what you want to order and you then hand that piece of paper to the workers inside. The entrance is blocked off to limit, hence protect, both the workers and customers. What's even more impressive is that as I was waiting for my food outside, one of the workers came and sanitized EVERYTHING- the clipboard I used, the table, door handles, AND EVEN THE PEN I used!

Not only that, they're probably the best poke place in all of Goleta as they have fresh quality fish you can taste and unique sauces. My favorites are the Miso Cilantro and Green Aioli. ique sauces and fresh quality fish you can taste. Additionally, the lychee rosewater drink is sosososo good! Highly recommend you try this place out!"

Style, quality, presentation: everything sets this restaurant apart. It is a welcome addition to the Santa Barbara food scene. I do like the simple, unassuming atmosphere.
Finally a restaurant that will change its menu once a month!!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I recommend Yoichi's! I know the real taste in Japanese food, because I'm from Japan. They serve high quality Kaiseki style meal. Sashimi and sushi were very fresh and dashi in every dish was flavorful. They directly import fish and ingredients even real wasabi from Japan."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Let me be the first to begin with the statement I would be incredibly surprised that Yoichi's is not on Michelin's radar. 

Incredible experience: The ingenuity, the flavor, the precision, the plating, and the service were flawless.

I've read other reviews as to ambience and it puzzles me as the beauty in Japanese style and aesthetics is about simplicity. It further underscores that with simplicity as the backdrop, the food can truly be the hero of the moment as described above.

The only heartbreak of the evening is that we discovered the Chef and his lovely proprietor wife  lived in San Francisco. So my city lost a jewel; nevertheless, happy for Santa Barbara for their new found treasure.  

Promise you this: My Chef partner and I will not be waiting until another birthday to enjoy in the delight of Yoichi's."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Last night we had a fabulous dinner! The food is very authentic and wonderful. This restaurant is extremely special. The waitstaff couldn't be sweeter or more attentive. Yoichi's is a gem!
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"We ate here a few months ago, and I forgot to review it.  I've forgotten the details, but I really enjoyed the meal.  We'll be back seasonally, as the menu changes to follow the sun."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Brilliant Japanese restaurant. Simple black and white decoration with comfortable seating. They offer a 7 course traditional Japanese menu for a very reasonable price (USD85) given the quality. We had such delicacies as king crab, oysters, sweat water and salt water eels, octopus and different types of fish for the sashimi and sushi courses. Service is excellent - as you would expect in Japan itself. Highly recommendable."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"https://youtu.be/Zuj1WkTudZU

This place is where you want to go if you want to celebrate something very special.

We went here to celebrate our 4th Year Annivervsary and my birthday on September 11, 2016.

It was perfect. My fiance told me we were going to an Authentic Japanese Restaurant and it was so perfect. 

$100 per person but it was worth it. 

Customer Service was PERFECT!

Food was PERFECT!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"One of the best dining experiences in Santa Barbara. High quality food, and excellent service. If you're looking for a great Kaiseki experience, this is the place. See for yourself."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"My mom and I thought we were simply going for sushi but we ended up with one of the best adventurous meals that made for a fun night we will not soon forget.  We had never heard of kaiseki before but hope to try it several more times now that we have.  

We would highly recommend Yoichis to anyone looking for a wonderful dining experience with a little adventure.  Some of the things they served I had never tried or wanted to try, but ended up thoroughly enjoying them.  I loved the attention to detail in presentation and the incredible flavors.  The ambiance was delightful with a simple Japanese design to things.

The menu is a set menu, though you do have a couple courses where you chose between 2-3 options.  We made sure to chose different things so we could try the others.  Our hostess (one of the owners) explained everything to us and was so sweet.  She even brought us all of the desert puddings to try because we couldn't decide.  We didn't order any alcohol but they do have their liquor license now.

I hope to visit again some day and made sure to tell our hotel all about it."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Amazing. This place should be on the top of everyone's list. It's by far the best restaurant in SB. Amazing kaseiki meal and service.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Yoichi's restaurant is the place to BE as a traditional Japanese restaurant in Santa Barbara. The 7 courses dinner is a truly culinary experience, fishes are so fresh, flavors are subtle and delicate. Presentation is beautiful. My favorite courses: the black COD and the EEL! The staff is warm and take time to explain you the different choices and courses.
I took the Mizbasho Sake recommended by the owner. I was really surprised; well balanced, roundness and pairs very well with the food.
We will definitively go back."

syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Each course was carefully planned out just as you would expect in a traditional kaiseke Japanese style meal.  The ingredients were all fresh and many of them imported from Japan.  The staff is all top notch, exactly what you would expect from staff in Japan.  Each dish was brought out on a timely basis.  The 7 course meal is large, and I recommend you come in on an empty stomach to be able to get through all of the courses.  This is an excellent date spot or some place to celebrate a special occasion with a food lover who is adventurous enough to try new flavors. Everything was executed 5 stars.  Thanks for a great experience!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I was here a month ago when I was visiting from LA and left a little sad knowing that this little gem is in Santa Barbara.

The food was really amazing and the workers were super attentive, ensuring we were having a good experience. Don't let the simple interior deter you from coming - all the food was so light and delicious that we were dreading the end of the course! 

I would definitely come back if I pass by or visit SB again!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This is a world class restaurant. We are so lucky to have a chef of Yoichi's calibre call our city home. My husband and I ate here last week and I have wanted to return every single night! We have told dozens of people about it. A part of me wants to keep it a secret so we can be assured of always getting a seat at this intimate, sublime restaurant. But a bigger part of me wants to spread the wealth. This is much more than a restaurant - it is a culinary celebration of a master chef at the top of his game. Yoichi obviously loves preparing his food as much as you will enjoy eating it. Expensive - but worth every penny."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Eating here is a must if you either live in Santa Barbara or are in for a visit.

Came here recently and it was worth every penny. It was easily the best meal I have ever had. We each ordered different things and loved it. The service was great, and our server was very pleasant. 

When I come back to Santa Barbara, I will definitely make it a point to come back."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Amazing food!!! Beautiful, exquisitely and carefully thought out courses. Fresh, flavorful and perfectly sized portions.  Even the pork belly did not feel heavy and we left feeling very satisfied but not disgustingly bloated. Attentive but not overbearing service- staff was wonderful.  Cannot wait to come back for more!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"We heard rumors that Yoichi's was finally open for service so decided to check it out last week. I'm actually hesitant to fill out this Yelp review for selfish reasons because I want to keep this secluded, delicious little culinary escape for myself! Although if it closed that would be heart breaking so here it goes... The food was fresh and magnificently beautiful. Our whole table ordered the 7 pate tasting menu and left the plate decisions up to the chef. We were politely delivered flavorful fish dishes that I had never had in all different forms-as well as sushi. I can't remember the names of all the fish and dishes, we were all having such a great time yapping about all the different flavors - who's got time to take notes? In short, the restaurant  was inviting, the staff cared for our needs, the food was delivered promptly, it was visually beautiful, and quite satisfying in regards to taste. I WILL go back again, perhaps after all these 5 star reviews I'll have to make a resi though."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"A very traditional Japanese tasting menu.  This seven course tasting gives you the most amazing experience of a true Japanese meal.  Staring with an appetizer box in which the food represents good fortune, health for the new year to desert of sweet potato or a sesame pudding.  Not only was the taste pleasing to the pallet, but the presentation was beautiful."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"7 course kaiseki so beautifully, thoughtfully and deliciously prepared. A true gem in SB. 
Some highlights were:
The cod milt 
Tofu and veggies wrapped in unagi 
Clear broth with crab and egg cake ( can drink that flavorful broth forever!) 
Hokkaido scallop sushi 

And great service!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"We had a spectacular meal.  I think that this restaurant is really destined for greatness as more people find out about it- it was recommended to me by a friend and I'm shocked that I had not heard about it otherwise.  The food is exotic, fresh, and masterfully prepared.  The service is spectacular, where questions about ingredients or Japanese terminology are equally met with eloquent explanations that make you understand that you are not in your average restaurant.  Each course seems better than the last, and even my wife who is not a great fan of the exotic was raving.  Oysters unlike any other oyster I have had.  FRESH king crab with unreal flavor and consistency.  Sushi and sashimi that I would prefer over Matsuhisa where we eat regularly.  The menu changes monthly, with the sushi menu changing daly, and quite simply, I can't wait to go back.  A fantastic addition to Santa Barbara and certainly a destination where it will soon be difficult to secure a reservation."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"Maybe I'm just not fancy enough to enjoy this type of food? 
To be totally honest, if you're going for the sashimi and sushi, this is not the place for you.  Every dish looked like a work of art, however much of it, I didn't care for.  And I didn't leave the restaurant full, or even satisfied.  The restaurant was empty and it made me wonder?  How fresh is the fish?  I mean, if they're not busy, then they're not throwing food away.  So I was a bit concerned.  The staff was extremely knowledgable and kind.  That and the presentation are about it for me gets the 2 stars.  I don't imagine this restaurant being around much longer.  
Sorry..."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"Very interesting* meal.  Anyone going here should know that the omakase is only available Tuesday through Thursday. The standard 7 course meal is decadent and meant for a very adventurous eater. There were some shining bright spots (uni was amazing, scallop was amazing), but it felt more like we were fighting through the extravagance than enjoying a meal."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend and wanted some Japanese food. Did a search, found Yoichi's and was instantly intrigue because they only serve a seasonal 7 course Kaiseki dinner which is unheard of outside San Francisco and possibly L. A. They appear to be quite new with only 20 reviews or so but all are 5 stars! So I called, made a reservation, when we arrived we where quickly greeted and taken to a table. The 7 courses took approximately 2 hours to serve, the food was wonderfully presented, fantastically fresh, tasty and I could not have asked for more! If you enjoy real Japanese food and or are willing to be adventurous, you have to try Yoichi's next time you are in Santa Barbara!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I'm giving them 5 stars strictly not to hurt their reputation. This very well may be what you're looking for, but as a person that loves out of the ordinary food, this was not what I wanted. Awesome that it was 7 courses, however each course was not even close to enjoyable. Once again, I didn't know what I was getting into, I was just going in hoping for the best, unfortunately coming out with the worst. $300 tab for my girl and I, and she likes even odder food than I do. I had to prevent her from sending dishes back due to the type of restaurant this was. Bottom line, I'll never go back, but if you like what 99% of the population doesn't, this may be for you."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"It gets as authentic as it can get. Totally felt like hi-end Tokyo restaurant. Super fresh fish, interesting flavors, great atmosphere and very welcoming people. Highly recommend!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"My 5th time here in as many months! We are so lucky to have this restaurant in Santa Barbara! It is a superb experience, as great as any kaiseki meal you'll have in Japan! The staff are welcoming and the meal experience is exceptional!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"7 course dinner was even more amazing than we expected. The black cod was so perfectly cooked and flavorful; the sashimi was cut so we could immediately see how fresh it was; the unagi wasn't covered in a super sweet ""unagi sauce"" but instead was served in a flavorful, slightly sweet broth; the house-made mochi crepe with red bean paste and cherry blossom leaf was one of the most simply, delicately satisfying and balanced desserts I've ever had. Nothing here to distract customers of their strive for simple elegance. 
The waitresses were friendly, knowledgable, and professional. They recommended how to eat certain items and explained the dessert should be taken with green tea. Small suggestions like that made my girlfriend and I feel very comfortable.
This is not the sushi place you are used to in the U.S., it is something so far surpassing and each dish was an expression of authentic, artistic passion. I'm happy we did the set dinner for our first visit, but I'm excited to go back for some sashimi snacks as well. Also can't wait for their liquor license to be approved-- it would be nice to have drink recommendations to pair with the set menu!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Sushi was amazzzzing! This is a very traditional sushi restaurant so don't go in expecting rolls and teriyaki bowls. 

I tried just about every piece of sushi you could order and loved all of it. Everything from the rice to the fish and the way it was plated was awesome. The owner was there too when I came in and she was so sweet and really explained all the dishes to me.

There is one beef dish on the kaiseki menu which is one of my new fave dishes in town and which I recommend you get. My other faves were the salmon belly and uni. Definitely will be going back!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Seasonal Japanese cuisine. Great sake selection, and wonderful service. If you are interested in Japanese fine dining, give Yoichi's a try."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Great traditional Japanese kaiseki for an unbelievable price, especially for a great 7-course meal. Each dish was beyond expectations and presented very artistically. Can't find kaiseki places like this in LA or OC areas where they are more known for Japanese cuisines. Service was very attentive, polite, and explained each dish thoroughly. We celebrated our anniversary and couldn't be happier with our experience here for this occasion. Hidden Gem in so cal!!!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,It is about time Kaiseki came to Santa Barbara.  The presentation is superb.  The flavors are subtle and sublime.  Best Japanese food in Santa Barbara.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"OMG..!!! This restaurant is amazing! I was blown away by the experience! Everything I ordered was so authentic, sooo good. The service was really good too. 
This was the place makes me wanna move to Santa Barbara."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Went to Yoichi's for about the fifth time on Valentine's Day, and certainly it was our best experience so far. Every course was absolutely on point, and the sashimi was absolutely the best I've ever had. Service is attentive and friendly, flavor and presentation are top-notch, and the price is well worth it for authentic Kaiseki. Definitely my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Best kaiseki i have ever tasted, their crab meat is omfg,  i have been to many japanese restaurant this is one that makes a memory in my mind"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,We just had the most amazing anniversary meal at this restaurant. We have traveled to Japan twice and have had many kaiseki meals and this meal transported us back there. The dishes were beautiful and diverse. The service was amazing. The high quality of ingredients and variety of preparations merit the $100 per person price (also way cheaper than flight to Japan). Can't wait to return here to have a taste of Japan right here in SB.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Amazing service and amazing food.  Seven courses and a bottle of wine is the way to go.  Not overly crowded, but really peaceful and intimate.  One of the best for sure as far as quality of sushi and awesomeness of the servers!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Truly authentic, amazing Japanese cuisine. Every taste was perfect and the selection of tastes was ingenious."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I don't really yelp much any more, but Yoichi's is just that amazing, I want to shout it from the rooftops. Santa Barbara is awash with ""sushi"" restaurants that rely on a lot of mayo and cooked fish, and until now I assumed I had to travel to LA to get real sushi. But no!  There's no question about the freshness of the fish here--the sashimi we had the last visit arrived at the restaurant still alive. My husband and I have had a number of meals here, and each one has been just exquisite. The owners are exceedingly kind and knowledgeable, and I feel so lucky to have them open a restaurant that serves fish fresh from the Tsukiji market in Japan in Santa Barbara, of all places. 

I've been here when it was there was a liquor license and when there wasn't, and it really didn't matter to me. The food is so excellent that I don't really want to drink much while enjoying it--the flavors do wonderfully on their own. 

Thank you so much, Yoichi owners!  Your existence is a huge bright spot on the SB dining scene."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Brilliant Japanese restaurant. Simple black and white decoration with comfortable seating. They offer a 7 course traditional Japanese menu for a very reasonable price (USD85) given the quality. We had such delicacies as king crab, oysters, sweat water and salt water eels, octopus and different types of fish for the sashimi and sushi courses.

syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Not only the best sushi I've had in SB but possibly the best restaurant I've been to. The 7 course meal was full of unique dishes, each one better than the last. Great service and nice intimate setting. Can't wait to go back for another meal!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This restaurant transported me to Japan. Absolutely great! Service great, food great."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I just had the pleasure of eating a wonderful kaiseki style meal at what is easily the best Japanese restaurant in Santa Barbara. The characteristics of a good kaiseki meal are seasonal fresh ingredients, a number of cooking techniques used, and an artistic presentation. On all fronts Yoichi's excels.

Before describing the meal in a little more detail you should know that a proper kaiseki changes with the seasons and you are likely to have different items. However, you can trust this chef who is clearly very skilled. 

The first course consisted of several small appetizers ranging from a Japanese clam to a small soup. All were delicious but the thing that stood out to me, and what makes a good kaiseki meal are the details. The clam was presented on a small bed of salt which links the clam to the sea. Excellent and artistic.

The soup was a wonderful shrimp ball with a complementary soup stock. The flavor was excellent but what elevated the dish was the presentation. The shrimp ball was fashioned into a rock shape and some very thin carrots were shaped into a shrimp shape to portray the shrimp on a rock. It was beautiful and delicious. 

There was a sashimi course and a sushi course as part of the kaiseki. The selection of fish was tasty and the sushi actually had vinegar in the rice as it should. One of my pet peeves in Santa Barbara is that many Japanese restaurants here use little to no vinegar in the sushi. This is odd because the ""su"" in sushi means vinegar!

One of my favorite dishes was an eel rolled with a vegetable filling and placed in a soup. It was so tender I'm not sure how the chef placed it in the soup! The grilled fish was absolutely perfectly cooked and the fish was incredibly fresh!

Lastly the dessert was homemade mochi with a sweet azuki bean sauce. Sweet but not too sweet. 

I will be back and I am very happy to have this caliber of Japanese food in Santa Barbara! 

TL;DR: Tasty and artistic Japanese food which rivals the best places in LA. Go here, you will thank me later."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Bad reviews of this restaurant are infuriating. This is the best Japanese cuisine south of San Francisco. This place is a must try in Santa Barbara. This is true Japanese food. Japanese people eat some weird shit, so be prepared for that. 

The flavors are very subtle, but phenomenal. Every dish brought something different. The king crab was killer. The eel was unreal. 

If you are a person who seeks out Pellegrino listers or counts their Michelin stars, this spot is for you. If you love Julienne, come try Yoichi."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"An authentic Japanese kaiseki experience in downtown Santa Barbara with the freshest of fish and vegetables, many sourced and flown in directly from Japan. The service is attentive, the presentations elegant, and the tastes sublime. This is a talented chef and a delightful experience."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Kaiseki cuisine is not for the uninitiated, and it is also not for the penny-pincher. However, if you enjoy fine Japanese dining and are looking to splurge, Yoichi's is a terrific choice. The dining area itself is humble but relaxingly quiet. There were several original woodblock prints on the walls which we admired. The servers were attentive and warm. BUT... the food is the star of this show. Every mouthful was perfect, from the delicate 'suimono' soup and sweet sake to the delicate bean cake. The 'yakimono' -- I had the 'gindara' (cod) -- tasted sweet and subtle. The broth that accompanied the 'mushimono' (I had the pork belly, my husband had duck) was so flavorful, I almost had to admit that it was even better than the 'yakimono'; every sip made me feel nourished and strong.  Well done, Yoichi's! I have two very small criticisms, which are only warranted because of the price point and because of the level of quality to which Yoichi's clearly aspires: First, the 'oshibori' (hot towels) served at the beginning should be real steamed towels, not throwaway paper towels. Second, the menu card which stayed at our table for our reference throughout the meal should reflect the season -- in our case, mid-summer -- and not be stamped with cherry blossoms. These are clearly nitpicks! My husband and I will remember our amazing meal at Yoichi's for a long time to come."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Wow, wow, wow! We came here for a family celebration dinner. All of us are huge lovers of Japanese food and culture, and adventurous eaters. Yoichi's did not disappoint.

The service was absolutely spot-on from start to finish, just casual enough to be comfortable for American diners like us but retaining that delightful air of Japanese ceremony and formality. Our waitress explained how the menu worked and gave us plenty of time to mull over the few dishes we had choices on, while she brought out a yuzu sake amuse for us.

All seven courses were incredible. I won't go course by course, but will say that if you're lucky enough to get the firefly squid, good for you! Wow, they were unbelieveable! The sashimi was, as expected, literally the freshest I've ever had; and the oyster in citrus bowl was incredibly plump and tasty. We ended with green tea puddings and happy faces.

I don't know when we'll be able to return to Yoichi's, but I hope it's soon. We're spoiled for the real world now."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Called day of to make a reservation for 4. We're from San Francisco Bay Area and this is unheard of! Especially for an amazing meal. We had such a wonderful time with an attentive staff and beautiful presentation of food. I lived in Tokyo for 11 years and this place is authentic. Ambience could be improved, not romantic, but definitely a foodies place. The sashimi basket was amazing. Sushi with big pieces of fish. Get the sesame pudding, not the strawberry for dessert. I love set menus because they challenge me to eat things I normally would not. Between the 4 of us e tried every option on the kaiseki menu. This place definitely was a pleasant culinary adventure!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Yoichi ' s is the first ""destination"" restaurant to appear in Santa Barbara in many years. It's worth driving from LA or SLO to dine in this small spare space with its wonderful kaiseki menu. It's not clear that a place this sophisticated and refined can survive in a town like SB, but it deserves to do so. The décor and the wine list still need some work, but the food is  exquisite: the four of us shared the various entrées  (there are only a few choices to be made with this set menu) and found them uniformly excellent,  with the Hokkaido king crab particularly memorable. Although it isn't cheap by local standards, it is a lot of food (consisting of small,  light, carefully composed dishes) and well worth the money. We'll be back!

01/28/18
Have returned to Yoichi's several times since my first review and it has remained  absolutely consistent and absolutely outstanding. The menu on this most recent visit included a pickled cherry blossom from Japan with a marvelous cherry-fruit taste, and a whole thumbnail-sized abalone liver, among many other wonders."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,A very amazing restaurant with exceptional cuisine. Very impressed! Very much worth the money that you pay and is great for a date or a classy night with the friends. Will be coming back as a regular! Highly recommended by anyone passing through or part of the Santa Barbara area. A classic Japanese experience.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"The art of sushi, lives at Yoichi's. And no surprise, as apparently Yoichi's previous experience includes the all-mighty Nobu of Japan. 

We went on Sunday night, and were in awe, taste after taste. 

If you expect your sushi to come with rocking atmosphere and crazy sushi guys tossing sake shots, this is not your place. 

But, if you appreciate the minimalism necessary for a complete focus on the food, Yoichi's is a must try, incomparable to anywhere else in SB. 

The star of the show is their 7 course meal, called Kaiseki. Plate after plate arrived, and each was such a huge wow of taste. 

From an amazing oyster, to a really hard to describe never before tasted but impossibly delicious seaweed shot, to A+ perfect melt in your mouth sashimi, to an eel roll that was oh so so sooo good, to absolutely perfectly grilled black cod and on and on the dishes kept coming and the wow's just kept flowing.

Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely. If nothing else, it's a gorgeous reminder of how amazing food can be when you stop trying to outdo the next guy, and instead, simply focus on your passion. - AB in SB"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"The food is complex, interestingly-crafted, and perfectly balanced. The ingredients are unique and creative, and I would highly recommend anything on the menu, because it is all delicious. Also, the staff is incredibly cordial and knowledgeable. Overall, the experience was wonderful and if you are ever in Santa Barbara, I definitely recommend this restaurant."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"My wife and I are from the San Francisco Bay Area.  We both love Japanese food and have it frequently.  

We were in Santa Barbara for a couple of days. After reading reviews from Zagat and the Independent, we decided to try give Yoichi's a try.

I rarely write reviews, but tonight's kaiseki dinner was extraordinarily good I had to put out a good word.  The skill of the chef was evident in dish after dish, bite after exquisite bite.  Flavor gets stars. Presentation gets 5 stars. Front of house also gets 5 stars.  

I'll write more when I get home but will upload some pics for now."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I really don't know what to say....except go. Experience this place. If you're open to something new, authentic, & outside the cookie-cutter Japanese cuisine, you'll not regret it.

All seven courses were amazing. I've never had Japanese food prepared in such an authentic way, or in such an authentic atmosphere. I couldn't of asked for a better ending to a weekend getaway. 

Each dish, & every bite, let me know I've never experienced real Japanese food before. Like I said, I really don't know what to say, & I would hate to dissuade people from going, by using bad vocabulary, or awkward descriptions, so I'm going to leave it at this."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,The sushi was very fresh.  We had the 4 course meal.  It was a great experience to try authentic Japanese Sushi and delicacy.  Even my two picky teenage kids enjoyed their dinner.  They were wowed on very course.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"The food is so thoughtfully prepared, fresh, and delicious. The prices are reasonable. Very sweet and helpful staff. Will come back."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,One of the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to and definitely the best in town.  The food is fresh and well-prepared and presented very nicely.  Will revisit in the near future for sure.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Food presentation was superb.  Food was great and wait staff attentive and full of information with respect to their dishes.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"A high-end dining experience one would expect only to find in cosmopolitan areas. Some of the most delicate catches flown in from Japan and Spain are as fresh as if they were caught locally. Chef Yoichi demonstrates his creativity by combining flavor, texture along with presentation to produce a remarkable product."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Omakase Oh My God-se! By far the best in SB to date.  10 stars for the artistic presentation and 9.9 stars for the flavor (I was hoping for yellowtail belly :(  ).  Highly and enthusiastically recommended.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Best authentic Japanese restaurant I've had outside of Japan. Amazing food and impeccable service. Highest recommendation for this place.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Heavenly.  Best Japanese food I've had in the States.  Current menu was a seven course meal, or Kaiseki.  Serene setting, pleasant and knowledgable staff.  They said the fish changes every couple days, and the full menu changes seasonally.  Great for couples, or groups or individuals.  Prepare for an evening of elegant Japanese gastronomy."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"My wife and I went here for her 35th birthday and we had one of our favorite meals of all time.  Each dish was thoughtful and perfectly crafted, the service was friendly and extremely attentive, and we liked the delicate and clean atmoshphere.  I've eaten in a fair number of Japanese restaurants across the US but this is probably the best I've had!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"We went back tonight, and if only we could give this a six star rating.  Everything is done to perfection.  Fresh, tasty, interesting, delicious.  Please continue your excellent job.  Congratulations."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Spectacular multi-course meal with amazing service. We had a very special birthday celebration and it was the perfect pick for the occasion. Each dish had very individual flavors and tastes. I think one of the best high-end restaurants in Santa Barbara. We hope to go back for more special occasions and over the holidays. A real treat.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Delicate delicious works of art kept coming. I went with my 3 grown kids for a magical food journey through the most exciting tiny food nuances of Japan. I took a bunch of photos. Very special 7 courses with lots of choices. We tried everything and all was amazing.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Fantastic. The service was perfect. The food was amazing. The fish was incredibly fresh; probably the best sashimi I have ever tasted.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Excellent and true and authentic Japanese cuisine. Came for the miso cod and left with a doggy bag in tow as serving sizes were very large and was too full to finish my sushi and rockfish which were delicious.  Very clean inside and very attentive service.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Went here for my birthday on Christmas eve and had an excellent time. Was treated to a sake cocktail which was wonderful. The staff were stellar and did an excellent job explaining the menu and dishes. They were very attentive and pleasant. The food was great. I enjoyed all seven dishes and many of them were a first for me. The meal was adventurous, fresh, and very tasty."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"RUN do not walk to Yoichi's. But seriously, please go experience this amazing, beautiful place and give it the attention it deserves. Every course was exceptional, both in presentation and in taste. From the homemade sesame tofu to the grilled, whole sweet fish to the mochi crepe at the end, I loved every bite. Service was spot on too. 

My husband and I both agree that it is the best meal we've ever had. Don't go there if you want a spicy tuna roll or fish smothered in sweet sauce. Yoichi's uses the freshest ingredients and lets them shine. There is a delicacy and grace to all the food. There is such attention to detail and precision to all the courses - they even have a local artist make new (gorgeous) dishes for each new monthly menu. 

Liquor license is pending and I'm looking forward to going back and trying the dishes with sake. The only bad part was that very few other people were there with us! Given the quality, this place should have a line out the door."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Transformational. I have been all over the world including two weeks in Japan a few months past. This is world class. One of the more memorable meals of my life. Served perfectly with unusual senses engaged. Unique tastes, perfect portions, Five course price fixe. Absolutely a perfect evening. Limited seatings, no drop ins. Really made for a special anniversary. It is really mind blowing. Service perfect. Sake lovely. ONLY small improvement could be art on the wall which is lacking. If you love fish, sushi, shashimi, and a unique experience---The best in Santa Barbara, Southern California, California and well beyond."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,It's a restaurant with great taste and best quality. Any similar food in LA will cost you more then 150.00./ person.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Outstanding, unique, delicious. So refreshing to have a restaurant that's not afraid to serve something out of the ordinary."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This was one of the best 2 hr. experiences (beyond a meal) of my life! It took me back to Japan with the first course and peaked at the 5th course with steamed oysters that were so tender, rich and delicate that I wouldn't have guessed were oysters if I had been blindfolded. This is my first Yelp review because I have never been this pleased with any dining experience or food. The service was superb. This is not classified as a sushi restaurant for a reason. The chef was the one to create the miso black cod dish at Nobu, one of the most memorable on the menu. Therefore, expect high quality (fish shipped overnight from Japan in seawater), authentic Japanese cuisine."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Our first trip to Santa Barbara so wanted to find a memorable meal to celebrating. After surfing the net and yelping I found Yoichi. I really wondered if the five star ratings were true and I can now say YES! Please make sure to reserve a table in advance (party of more than 2 will require a credit card hold) Dining experience took 2 hours but each dish is so beautifully and delicately presented. It might appear like just a few morsel of food but at the end of the meal it was satisfying (clean eating). Most if not all ingredients were shipped fresh from Hokkaido or parts of Japan. If I'm ever back in SB I'll be back. Now it's whether our other dining experience will be able to top this one.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Whenever I take a trip to the LA area I make a point of going to Yoichi's. I have been there three times in the last two years. This is easy the best Japanese restaurant one can find in the Santa Barbara area. There is not many places where one can get authentic Japanese-Japanese high end cooking.  The meal is Kaiseki meaning the chef offers a set menu for the day of small dishes with various customer choices within the menu. The food comes out in small dishes arranged to look like a work of art. Although the restaurant is rated $$$$ in terms of cost I think I would pay about 30-40% more in San Francisco or Los Angeles for an equivalent Kaiseki meal.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I kind of feel like I never need to eat anywhere else ever again in Santa Barbara. Yoichi and his staff bring the best of Japan and Japanese flavors to the CA Central Coast showcasing the best of local and Japanese sourced seasonal cuisine. Our visit tonight has us longing to return to Japan, but with a satisfaction that a near future reservation will hold us over until our next trip. Kaiseki at its best!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Astoundingly good. This isn't just dinner. It's a full experience. You feel like you're at a theatre or museum waiting for the next dish/piece of art to come out of the kitchen, all perfectly choreographed and coordinated so you're never bored or hungry, but also never rushed to finish whatever delicious dish you're on. 

Of course you pay for quality this high, but for a special occasion or celebration, it is worth it and then some. Not many restaurants this unique in the country, let alone Santa Barbara."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This place is so hidden away in downtown Santa Barbara, but such a unique spot to visit! It's authentically Japanese and serves a seven course meal which will not disappoint. This is unlike any other Japanese restaurant I've been to. Yes, the portions for each course are on the smaller size but packed with immense flavor! By the time I finished my meal, I was happily full. It is pricey and takes some time to transition between courses! Do NOT come here if you're expecting to order sushi rolls and getting rowdy from sake bombs! It's authentic, minimalist and quaint. The servers seemed traditional and very hospitable. They also told us some of the fresh fish were shipped all the way from Japan. Overall, I was very pleased coming here and enjoyed eating each course!! Come here with people you think would appreciate the experience! I would come back here in a heartbeat if I could for a nice occasion."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Superb food and presentation...first time having a real 7 course Japanese dishes. It is not your typical Japanese food, so don't expect California Rolls etc.. Service and staff were superb. Not great for kids as we took out 6 and 11 years old here. The course can last about an hr or so. Atmosphere can be a bit nicer and need more decos...otherwise food is superb. Will come again."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Our first Kaiseki experience.  So good, everything. We had both soups, eel cake & the other fish cake with yummy oyster center.  This isn't the usual tasteless fish cake with pink outside, this was tasty. Oh, the beef on the appetizer plate was tender like butter.    Also my first water shield experience, which was citrusy, slimy, crispy.  We had top shell, which was chewy, sweet thin slices of shell fish in a very sweet broth, dip the sea weed garnish in the broth.  My partner had pork belly, so rich & good.  Black cod also great, rivals Nobu's.   sushi & sashimi were delicious & so fresh, toro stands out."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"My belief is that this is the best restaurant in SB. It was an amazing 7 course meal and be prepared to try new amazing tastes and favors!

FYI, they also now have a liquor license."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Dined here last night for the very first time with my boyfriend. This isn't our first Kaiseki dinner, but compared to most this is one of the better ones. The only dish we did not enjoy was the steamed fish (Japanese Rockfish). The taste was great, the quality was great, the bones were not great. But it's not a big deal. The service was definitely 5 stars. I liked how it's a reservation based restaurant, it kept the space very intimate and allowed the servers to inform and educate us on each dish. OVERALL, I left with my pant button unbuttoned hehe"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"After much anticipation we took the family to Yoichi's last night and has an amazing meal.  We knew it was a little more upscale than where we would normally bring our young children but fortunately they were very accommodating, bringing out edamame, tempura, and chicken for the munchkins.  My wife ordered the 10-piece sushi plate which excelled not only in presentation but the quality of the fish.  I ordered the signature Kaiseki seven course meal, and I was rewarded both with the flavor and texture of the food.  As I expected, the sushi was delicious and I was truly impressed by the black cod.  The restaurant itself had a sunny, clean feel and the service was excellent.  We're already looking forward to our next date night there!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"OK, my wife and I are Japanese food experts.  We live in Santa Barbara and Tokyo having residences in both places.  Yoichi's is the real deal--same as Tokyo.  If you want authentic Japanese food, not the Amer-Japanese concoctions of most of the Japanese restaurants in the U. S., or Japanese restaurants run by Koreans, Hispanics and other non-trained chefs, Yoichi's is the place.  This is an outstanding restaurant run by a chef who simply knows his trade and prepares every dish to perfection.  Santa Barbara (the whole West Coast) is lucky to have such a wonderful restaurant.  If eating gourmet Japanese food is your thing, like it is to my wife and I, look no further, go straight to Yoichi's"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Visited Yoichi's for anniversary dinner, what a great experience! 7 course, prix fixe menu. $100 is worth it. We added a bottle of sake as well. Apps were great, very seasonal... perhaps the best course, tasty, artistic, I could have eaten an entire plate of the waygu beef! Soups were great, very mild, but delicious... the hamaguri clam fish cake soup was the clear winner. Sashimi was wonderful. The grilled course was tasty... top shell (snail) was great, and the duck breast wonderful. The steamed course was interesting... a sweet and smokey pork belly versus a mild egg custard, but great in their own way. Sushi was top notch - the scallop was the best. Dessert was ok, I'm not a big dessert fan... the green tea ice cream was overly herbaceous, the sesame ice cream was better. 

The meal was well paced, never felt rushed, plenty of time to talk and enjoy sake between courses. It was a Wednesday and we were the only couple in the restaurant most of the evening (there was a table who left just as we arrived.) Servers were great, attentive and willing to answer all the questions we had about the great food they presented us with. The restaurant is small, but comfortable... not in downtown, but adjacent. For all the reviews complaining of the decor, don't believe them. The decor (or lack thereof) does not detract from the food and if you're focused on the ceiling, you're completely failing and appreciating the great dishes you're presented. 

This spot is right up there with the best of them, except without the pretentiousness you'll get at fancy places with the famous names."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This place was amazing 
This really is a hidden treasure. Found in a quiet residential street in the heart of Santa Barbara this restaurant aims to please Service was outstanding I would say on par with a Michelin star restaurant VE course meal was very filling considering that these were about seven small plates containing various fresh offerings and items that have been cooked for three days to perfection

And the unbelievable part is the price considering this meal should probably have been close to $600 we paid less than half of that here in Santa Barbara for an outstanding meal 

The first course was a variety of  seafood offering with the next being sushi then a grilled lobster and then very tasty broth soups sashimi desert omg it was amazing"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"The best dining experience and food of my life! Exquisite food prepared as art and unimaginably delicious!  Wonderful, attentive service. We are stunned with gratitude and appreciation for this meal.  Thank you!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"returned raving about how great it was but was utterly disappointed, the last time I ate there it was one of the most impressive meals I've ever had this time, was mediocre at best and more expensive than the last meal which was vastly better. .. going down hill and fast, very disappointed"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"What a delicious meal! We came for our anniversary.Beautifully prepared food! Excellent service!
Definitely for the adventurous palette!
We loved it!
Highly recommend this restaurant for a unique experience on a special occasion!
Every course was a work of art!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"World class cuisine in Santa Barbara! Prepare yourself for a relaxed, absolutely delicious, perfectly proportioned, expertly prepared, and pleasantly served dining experience. With a $100 per person prix-fixe menu (the only option) you receive a great 7 course meal with excellent choices that make it well worth it! The sake is excellent and the staff observes classic Japanese hospitality traditions. Dinner generally takes about an hour and a half to enjoy so don't expect a quick drop in. This was a fantastic dining experience!!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I had dinner at Youichi tonight with my boyfriend to celebrate the end of the year. A hidden gem in Santa Barbara. I hope more people come by here. We had the 7 course kaiseki meal. Everything we ate delicious but the highlights were the appetizer choices, sashimi, steamed dish, sushi, and desserts. They change menus depending on the season but here were my favorites:

For appetizers, we shared the wagyu beef and miso braised pork. Both were absolutely delicious. The beef had a really subtle yet full flavor. 

For sashimi, the winner was definitely the Mt. Fuji salmon. Really amazing texture. Not your average salmon. They also gave us a hybrid of the amberjack and yellowtail (totally forgot the name, my bad), but the fish was so buttery and melted in my mouth.

The best steamed dish of the night was their tangerine oysters. The tangerine broth was very good. Not overtly citrusy but good enough flavor to complement the oysters. 

For sushi, the winner was the Santa Barbara Uni... so buttery! I usually don't like uni - I've had bad experiences with bitter tasting uni, but this one was so smooth and no bitter aftertaste. Best uni I've bad

The desserts were also delicious... their puddings had full bold flavors. 

The service was great as well. Great ambiance and the server was very helpful in explaining all the dishes but never stood around us awkwardly and gave us our time and privacy to eat.

Overall, one of the best meals I've had. Will definitely be visiting again if I'm in the area."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Having lived in Tokyo for several years we were intrigued by the Kaiseki format at Yoichi. We were not disappointed. Very attentive service, excellent presentation and authentic food much of which we learned was sourced daily from Japan. Highly recommend."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I would come back with friends next time we're in the area. Great service, great good and very Zen ambiance. The star of course is the food. There are little items that may be improved like how the wagyu was made, wish it were rare, but it came well done. The king crab's meat was not off the shell tender. They can also de-bone the fish before hand. I still give it a 5 star because these 3 can be ignored but I feel are part of what's keeping them back from getting that Michelin. Overall great meal, presentation and service. When in SB, it's worth checking out."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Are you kidding me?! This is one of those places i want to keep a secret so anytime I want to eat here there is an open table, but I'm not that rich so I have to spread the word to keep this place going. Opened just two weeks ago, so they are still waiting on their liquor license, which they said is coming in three weeks. We got the 7 course tasting menu and every dish blew us away. The sushi/sashimi was just a cherry on top of all the other freshly prepared dishes. You definitely get what you pay for here, amazingly fresh food with unique flavors expertly prepared. Definitely a restaurant you could find in any of the big cities, but instead SB gets this gem."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Amazing!! You have never tasted seafood this delicious or as artfully prepared. You can't be picky when you dine here, as there are not many choices. If you think you won't like something, try it any way, chances are you will because they prepare items like you have never tasted before. I honestly cannot think of enough wonderful things to say about this place. It's definitely a special occasion type of place, as it is pricey and the menu is very small, but worth every penny! There is nothing like Yoichi's anywhere in or near Santa Barbara- it is a real treat!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Refinement. That's the best word to describe not just the meal, but the whole experience. Grilled Ayu, a fish in season for only a short time, and cooked whole, with the eggs intact. Or Flying Fish Sashimi, plated as if it was an abstract painting of a fish in flight. Or even something as simple as the flatware and drinking vessels, which are made by hand by a local Japanese artisan and chosen for their aesthetic harmony with each dish. There's such attention to detail, that I felt it was a crime not to photograph everything that came out of the kitchen. My favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara...there's nothing that comes even close."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Exquisite Japanese cuisine!  We had a terrific dinner. We chose a few items, the rest was chef's choice. A 7 course delight. All was terrific. Service was very good. Decor is a bit sterile."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"A traditional 7-course Japanese meal with multiple options along the way.  Service was great and authentic from the dishes to the variety of food. Food was delicious- if you are adventurous you can try the traditional items or they have standard cod fish/duck, etc. as options.  Definitely a unique experience you can't get anywhere else, but do get the sushi/sashimi and local uni to taste! Perfect for a date night."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I'm writing this review with the intention of revisiting Yoichi's again in the future as I see much potential. The seven course meal was definitely an unique experience as there were many things on the item that I have not tried before - however, I didn't love all of it. The ankimo (steamed monkfish liver), cod eggs (it looked like a brain), and salted mullet roe (like a stick of compacted fish eggs) were my least favorite, as they are definitely peculiar tastes that require more accustoming to. 

Unfortunately, some of the sashimi were also the most disappointing aspect. I appreciate that the chef himself wakes up at 5 am each day to go to the fish market in Los Angeles to pick up fish shipped from Japan. However, in the sashimi portion based on the chef's selection, only one out of the four fish that I tried were truly fresh. Instead of being supple and firm, the mackerel, amberjack and toro were all towards the thready and mushy consistency. It was shocking to see that they resembled fish that was frozen and overly thawed. They were simply not fresh to my standards for a high-end kaiseki resturant. The portions of the sashimi were generous, but I would rather see the focus to be on freshness as well as more variety of fish. 

Pros: They are great at making accommodations if you are pescetarian and do not eat meat. The beef dish in the appetizer was swapped out for a mountain vegetable mix, which I enjoyed. For those who drink alcohol, they recently got their alcohol license and offer two pages of wine and beer. The portions for most of the seven courses were very generous and I felt quite stuffed. The service was very friendly and thorough, as well as very knowledgable about every item on the menu. 

Cons: The ceiling is not insulated so the only group of 4 people that was drinking alcohol really amplified the sound of the entire space. It definitely changed the ambiance of what previous Yelpers classified the restaurant to be (""classy"") to something non-intimate. There is no a la carte menu for trying sashimi that is outside of the kaiseki menu (what the chef picks up from the fish market is what you get). No uni for the uni lovers, at least not on the Thursday night that I went. Again, limited in the variety and freshness of sashimi.

Overall, a fun dining experience to try with others but I am hoping for improvements in quality and variety of fish at my next visit."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend and wanted some Japanese food. Did a search, found Yoichi's and was instantly intrigue because they only serve a seasonal 7 course Kaiseki dinner which is unheard of outside San Francisco and possibly L. A. They appear to be quite new with only 20 reviews or so but all are 5 stars! So I called, made a reservation, when we arrived we where quickly greeted and taken to a table. The 7 courses took approximately 2 hours to serve, the food was wonderfully presented, fantastically fresh, tasty and I could not have asked for more! If you enjoy real Japanese food and or are willing to be adventurous, you have to try Yoichi's next time you are in Santa Barbara! 

Update 3/10\18

Second outing to this superb restaurant which I ate at for the first time just over two years and it still does NOT disappoint! I'm not sure why but they should definitely have a Michelin Star  by now. 

If your ever in Santa Barbara please try this beautiful gem of a restaurant nestled in a quaint neighborhood area!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Cute small corner restaurant in SB. The 7 course meal was phenomenal! Every dish had a unique presentation, great flavor, and generous portion size."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"12/11/18 UPDATE: We continue to be impressed by this extraordinary Japanese restaurant in Santa Barbara. Each time we visit we are amazed by the attention to detail, the outstanding service, and the exceptional quality of the food. It's a great place for anniversaries, significant dates, or other special dinners. 
-----
World class cuisine in Santa Barbara! Prepare yourself for a relaxed, absolutely delicious, perfectly proportioned, expertly prepared, and pleasantly served dining experience. With a $100 per person prix-fixe menu (the only option) you receive a great 7 course meal with excellent choices that make it well worth it! The sake is excellent and the staff observes classic Japanese hospitality traditions. This was a fantastic dining experience!!"

Went here with my wife a few nights ago.   The ingredients are fresh and the courses are good but a few of the courses didn't really wow us.  The staff is very nice and very attentive with great service.  The atmosphere is a little bland and the lighting is a bit too much.  

For $85.00 per person, I felt that they could of given a few more pieces of sushi on the sushi course or a little more sashimi on the sashimi course.  I left hungry and wanted more.   I felt for what we received, that $65.00 or $70.00 per person would have been more appropriate.

This place has the potential to be really outstanding.  They expect to receive their alcohol license soon.  Our server said they plan to have a sake pairing option with their menu which would be a huge plus in my opinion.  Hopefully the owner / chef will add just a little more food to a few of the courses or tweak the pricing down just a little bit. 

My wife and I will return to give them another shot after they receive their alcohol license."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This place was the highlight of my work-trip to Santa Barbara last week. To be honest, I'm never really impressed with SB restaurants but THIS ONE pleasantly surprised me with its exceptionally high quality dishes and the service they provided. It was my first time Kaiseki experience and, BOY, had I been missing out on this amazing  treasure! The food was prepared with freshest ingredients anywhere, which is an integral core for Japanese cuisine. If you are looking for rolls prepared with cream cheese and mayonnaise, this place is definitely not for you. But, if you are a genuine Japanese food enthusiast, this will be your favorite spot for authentic Japanese gourmet. I'd definitely come back to SB just to visit this restaurant. A+."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Went back for the 3rd time tonight. Still delicious. Still beautiful. Still perfect.

If I had the money, I'd eat here every day. Highly recommended for adventurous eaters or those who love Japanese food or those who just want an impeccable meal."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Yoichi's was very impressive. The seven course tasting menu offered an authentic Japanese dining experience. It includes an app course, soup, sashimi, grilled course, streamed course, sushi course, and dessert. All were excellent and the portions were appropriate for a seven course meal. My personal favorite was the miso marinated black cod - the fish (which was local) was rich and practically melted in your mouth. Service was excellent as well - the wait staff was very knowledgeable about each course - and the ambiance was befitting of the nice meal but also very relaxed. I highly recommend you try Yoichi's."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Fantastic, a steal for the price. Complex preparations, subtle and delicious tastes.  Other reviewers have detailed the food. I would highlight a divine oyster in the appetizer sampler, and the salmon with ikura. Off-scale! Overall the food is perfect, with impeccably sourced ingredients. I only hope Santa barbarians will appreciate it enough to make this place a success--the chef deserves it!

A few minor notes. It's a nice space but the lights could be dimmed--the high ceilings and bright light make it feel a bit cavernous. 

Also, Currently, they are only serving the kaiseki. According to the owners, this is on account of an unexpected departure of their sushi chef. I sincerely hope he is replaced, because the quality of the sushi and sashimi in the kaiseki makes me very curious to explore what else they might offer in that department. 

Anyway, here's hoping this place takes off."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I ate at Yoichi's last night as my boyfriend wanted to try a Kaiseki meal. While my palette for Japanese is unrefined and limited to sushi places, Yoichi's presented the consummate dining experience. The service was delightful, caring, and welcoming. Our server was deeply knowledgeable about the plates and described where each ingredient originated, as much was imported from Japan. 

Every dish was artfully and carefully presented. Since I'm not the most adventurous eater, or accustomed to eating lots of raw fish, my favorites were the oyster appetizer, steamed pork belly, king crab, and fatty tuna sushi. The fish was the freshest and cut beautifully. 

The servers truly care about your experience as our server encouraged us to try new foods. The decor is simple and clean, which some people griped about, but you're coming here for the food and impeccable presentations, not the interior design. I found the space to be intimate and inviting. I'm grateful that Yoichi's showed me a taste of traditional Ja"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"The best Japanese food I've ever had (and I used to live in the Bay Area)!  If you appreciate refined flavors, beautiful and tasteful dishes, and want a dinner experience, this place is it.  Not many places do food like this (kaiseki  style; 7-course meals), so SB is fortunate to have this place here near downtown.  While pricey ($85/person) it's worth it, particularly for a special occasion.   I plan to go again as the menu changes each month."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Great food and great service. I will highly recommend to visit this unique restaurant when you visit Santa Barbara. I am not a big fan of pre fixed menu, but loved this one."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"I'm a Sushi fanatic. I could eat it every day. Born and Raised on fresh sashimi and sushi and I make it at home too. This place is good. The food by and large is good but very expensive. SMALL PORTIONS. I get this part - sushi and sashimi are expensive. The one thing that really turned me off, I ordered the simmered duck breast off the 7 course menu and I got what looked like and tasted like Duck gizzards - chewy and flavorless. The grilled duck breast option isn't on the menu now and that sucked cuz I was looking forward to it after seeing the pictures here on Yelp.  $100 a person and another hundred sake and beer - No way. I got home and saw what the grilled duck breast looked like in the pictures here on Yelp  and wished I had not ordered the boiled duck gizzards I ended up getting. For $300 I have a place near me that's really good (not my favorite but still really good) the guy is about 60, straight from Japan and I could order giant clam, toro, sweet shrimp with the heads (which Yoichi does not provide you with), yellowtail belly, Japanese mackerel, mentaiko rolls and oysters until my head falls off and add 4 large sake's to it too! Speaking of sake for sake sake - Yoichi's sake is excellent. It's $22 for the cheapest one but very good, better than you'll get at your standard or even high end Japanese restaurant unless you ask for and pay for the good stuff.
My advice is to find a good sushi chef from Japan that makes all the standard Sushi excellent, Salmon, Hamachi, Maguro etc., then get to know him by going frequently THEN go to town and either order everything you like specifically or do omakase. 
(I.E., ""Hide"" in West LA or ""Goshi"" in SLO)
I Stay away from Korean sushi places. So unless you like it that way with a bunch of sauce all over everything and rolls obfuscating any fresh fish that might be in them, stick with a Japanese chef. If they don't know what mentaiko or shiso Leaf is - it's a Korean place. Even then, always ask the chef where he's from.
Party On!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Best restaurant in SB. If you appreciate flawless execution this is the place for you. Service is personal and you can tell they have a passion for the artistic ability of the chef. I can't recommend this restaurant enough.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Truly exquisite from beginning to end. It is clear how much time, skill, and love goes into preparing and presenting this food, down to the finest detail. I wish I'd taken more pictures. It was a true dining experience. At first I thought I would miss the sake, but it was almost better without alcohol. It kept me present to the whole sensory experience of this meal. Each course was uniquely different in flavors and textures. Now that I know what I'm getting into, I think I will enjoy it even more the next time. No need for dinner AND a movie here -- the food is the show! Definitely take your appetite and a sense of adventure with you!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I won't discuss the food and service superlatives in this post. 

Make reservations for this experience before they get Michelin stars and reservations become ridiculous.

As a cautionary reminder, see the negative reviews from people upset that they could not get a seating. Yeah... expect more of these."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I have had more than fair share of kaiseki in Japan and in the US. I found the kaiseki I had at Yoichi's to be solid. It's very authentic. Their presentation of the food was nice, and so was the taste. However, none of the dishes really impressed me in terms of the taste, unfortunately.

There are a couple of specific issues that I would like to bring up to provide an informative review for my fellow Yelpers and constructive feedback to the restaurant.

1. You can order their sake (or wine) only by the bottle. This is a significant issue because it makes it impossible to pair different sake with different courses. Different sake brings out or complements different courses. With that said, I would like to see a sake pairing option.  

2. Some reviewers talked about their interior design. While I am not a specialist, I agree that simplicity is an important concept in Japanese culture. However, I felt it's more accurate to describe their interior design to be ""bare"" rather than ""simple."" I think it's such a shame that the interior design takes away from the beautiful presentation of their food.

I understand that whatever the decision they made, it has financial consequences. So, it's easier to say than done, but I wanted to share my two cents.

syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I was a bit skeptical when the hostess, over the phone, told me it's a traditional Japanese sushi restaurant and the meals come in 7 courses and that they don't currently have their liquor license. But, there was something about the honesty in her highly educated-Japanese-American-English accent. I looked over at my wife, who'd been listening over a travel magazine as she looked up and smiled, indicating she was down to try it. ""Book us for 8:30...were walking over from the Upham,"" I said before hanging up. 

The street isn't as well lit as we expected, as the restaurant is nestled between homes that appear to be converted into business...the same for Yoichi's. We walked into an empty restaurant and was greeted with a traditional bow and the standard, ""do you have reservations"" by a young slightly nervous but adorable waitress/hostess. I smiled, ""yes, under Paul."" 

The look of the restaurant was understated elegance. Everything looked to be where it should be. Easy to see it was well thought out. My wife couldn't get over the dishes...she continued to comment until the more mature waitress explained they were made by a friend specifically for this restaurant. Even as a somewhat disinterested guy, I could see why my wife was impressed. ...even the soy sauce container was unusually chic. Lastly, on the decorum, the bench with which we sat had slightly angled back with a padded seat. The item that caught my attention was, for some very strange and unusual reason, the back felt padded. But it wasn't--it was a simple hard-wood finish...but, it felt padded. I kept touching to see if I was somehow mistaken. I don't have any idea how they achieved this feat...

The food was epic. Everything beautifully presented and explained. And get this, the menu changes daily depending on the catch. We had fish I'd never heard of and I've been eating sushi for over 30 years. They had soups, steams, grills, raw... This may have been the best sushi I've ever had. To further illustrate, I've never been a big fan of uni, but the young waitress very subtly and elegantly encouraged us to try the uni shooter. What the hell, right? After trying it, I ordered two more. Turns out the Master Chef trained at the original Nobu in Japan. 

Lastly, the service and the conversation were impeccable. There was the perfect amount of conversation and silence. As good as the Master Chef, the Mistress Waitress was equal--the way they kept your glass filled and ask if you wanted more ice; the way the kept the table spotless throughout the meal...the perfectly timed comments. Ladies and gentlemen, this place is a hidden gem in Santa Barbara. Don't walk, run. 

Initially, I thought food might be slightly expensive, but after trying it, with the quality, taste, and presentation, it was well worth it. In fact, I left them a 45% tip because of the experience--one just does not often experience something this unique anywhere. 

My only knock was they served green ice tea from a can... I hate that..."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"Perhaps my expectations was too high after reading and seeing the photos on Yelp.
I was thinking this is a special occasion place since we couldn't get reservation on our last visit last year so we make a point to try this place on our last trip to Santa Barbara last weekend 
I was debating between here and the Sushi bar at Montecito Inn since I wanted an upscale and special experience and decided to go here to check off my list.
Let just say I was disappointed when I entered since the restaurant wasn't even half full literally there were 9 people eating the entire evening all were in the 4 booths and the rest of the tables on the other 2/3 of the restaurant was empty.  You know what they say about empty restaurant on a Friday night right, mean food won't be as fresh since not enough people to consume what they sell.  They could dim the light perhaps to make it a bit warmer it just feel empty and cold. Even with the effort of a small tea light candle on the table
Anyway so the ambiance was a bust but we were there to eat food so it was fine.
Next came the menu price somewhere on the site I saw $85 for 7 courses but when we showed up it was $125, if I would have known I would have for sure chosen the 17 courses for $125 at the sushi bar at Montecito.  So oh well right, it's $40 difference which is fine if the food was outstanding.
There were 2 waitresses they were polite, prompt but for sure at time they look bored.  Again may be my expectations is higher for the caliber and price of food.
Came the food, beef tasted old and over cooked everything else was either bland or sweet not balanced 
Fish and sashimi were good, they were fresh but they tasted average fresh sushi, I don't have complaints but not wow.
Everything else again was sweet or ok again nothing to rave home about.  The only one thing I like out of the entire meal was the Uni but for $12.95 a box at Santa Barbara fish market I can get the exact same Uni though so for that reason I don't think the ambiance and price worth the experience I was expecting.
Nice presentation of food but something is missing for sure so don't let those photos trick you, if you are looking for a special and wholesome experience this will not be the place.  As we were there to celebrate our anniversary but it wasn't celebrated at all...lol we left disappointed!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I ordered the seven course kaiseki, one of the most special meals I have ever had. I've traveled extensively in Japan too, so I'm not new at this.

syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This was not only a meal but one of those dining experiences. Each course was presented beautifully and with such care. There were 5 of us and we tried to order various things to be able to fully experience a wide variety of delicacies.  2 of us ordered the 7 courses while 3 of us ordered the smaller $65 option (which I must tell you is plenty enough). 

If the intestine is on the menu, order it.  It is so unique and tasty and I still can't believe it has the flavor it does and is as tender as it is.  The various sashimis and sushis were perfect - of note - trout! Something I had never tried.  

The service was so attentive without being obtrusive. 

Restaurant is quite small, in an unassuming neighborhood and we passed it up without even realizing it.

If you are ready for an evening that you will remember, this is for you."

THEN... like a gift from the sea comes Yoichi. A former chef from Nobu Tokyo, Yoichi brings lovely, thoughtful, wonderful Kaiseki to this off the strip dining room. 

This (reasonable compared to  other equivalent spots) set menu is delicious - and nothing like any other dining experience in SB. 

This is maybe the first 'destination' restaurant I have found in SB to date - and against the rather meager competition I give it easily 5 stars on the Santa Barbara scale. 

Here is the hitch... this place is NOT packed - and SB seems not to get what they have here... Ladies and Gentleman of the coast - get your collective heads out of your spicy tuna rolls and celebrate what you have here - before you loose it! 

Thank you Yoichi - Great spot!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"Very good kaiseki restaurant with attention to detail, though a number of things were disappointing.

There is a menu from which you select dishes you would like as part of a 7 course meal. If you are (hopefully) dining with another person, then you'll be able to try almost everything on the menu. There are 7 courses, but I was able to try nearly 14 different dishes (!):

- #1 Assorted Appetizers -
I love variety and this ""platter"", if you will, had many distinct items - wagyu beef or pork belly, abalone, fish cakes, fried tofu, and jellyfish. The abalone was very tender and flavorful. Pork belly was unctuous. Fish cakes and tofu were surprisingly good -- great texture and flavor. Fantastic start!

- #2 Soup -
a. Clear soup with egg cake
b. Clear soup with steamed tomato
Both nothing to write home about. More of palate cleanser, I suppose?

- #3 Sashimi -
GORGEOUS presentation. Chef's selection was salmon from Japan (less oily than American), squid, and red snapper (?). The sashimi itself was nice, but not much more. I do very much appreciate the real, grated wasabi though.

- #4 Grilled Dish -
a. Lobster tail with red miso - Pretty good
b. Duck breast - Even better! They marinate this in a delicious sweet soy sauce and the tenderness is unreal. I'm glad they kept the skin on with its fat, because that added a lot to the flavor.

- #5 Steamed Dish -
a. Marinated sweet fish with roe - Awful. The flavor was extremely heavy in terms of its sweetness and smokiness. It was like eating mushy tar.
b. Steamed rock fish simmered in sweet broth - Overly sweet and salty, although quite nice

- #6 Sushi -
Chef's selection: Crab leg, scallop, and Santa Barbara (!) uni
I was expecting more. The crab leg and scallop didn't have much flavor and the uni was good, but I've had better.

- #7 Dessert -
Both desserts came with a wedge of dried persimmon, which we were instructed to eat first
a. Black sesame custard - Not very sweet, had plenty of black sesame flavor
b. Green tea custard - Very nice, wish I had more than a few spoonfuls!

Overall, the good outweighed the bad -- I'd rate it more like 3.5 stars. The food was clearly conceived by a skilled kaiseki chef. Our server was pleasant, helpful, and attentive.

Unrelated to the food/service, but I thought the interior design was strange. It was very Japanese in that it was simple with natural tones, but with Denny's-style hanging lamps over the tables, and an almost anachronous chandelier and ceiling-mounted A/C unit.

For $100, it's a reasonable price for a 7-course meal. Just make sure you don't pick some of the items I mentioned above and you'll have a lovely experience!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Impeccable service and fantastic food. I had a great experience at this restaurant and truly enjoyed every bite. The seven course fixed menu is a perfect amount of food.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Very nice people but they have some work to do. 

They have no liquor license, which was wasn't the end of the world, but it's awfully expensive to not have anything except water or green tea. 

They do what they call kaiseki, but it really isn't. It's really more omakase, without the complicated preparations and plating you would get in Japan. It was also $85 dollars per person. I'm completely fine with spending that amount of money for an experience that lives up to it. This really didn't. I wanted to love the place, it's really cute and the servers were super attentive and kind. However, I can go to many other omakase places and get higher caliber food for the same amount or less. It just didn't blow me away. They are new, so I hope they sort some of the kinks out."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"If you are into traditional japanese pleasures - this is a MUST experience.  Attention to detail.  Impeccable service and pacing.  Food as both art and nourishment.  Definitely one of my top experiences (not just one of my best dining experiences) of 2018.

Most of the ingredients are traditional and the food preparation does not bend to americanized tastes.  Thus if your idea of japanese food is a California Roll and some green tea ice cream this is probably not the place for you.  

Quality of ingredients and thoughtful preparation is evident in every dish.  Everything from scratch.  Our seven course kaiseki dinner included items such as black cod, duck breast, japanese oysters, grilled scallop, blue fin, and sazae (a japanese mollusk).  We spent almost two hours at Yoichi's and enjoyed and savored every minute.

The sazae was removed from it's shell, diced, and then placed back inside the shell with tiny mushrooms and a light sauce and then grilled and eventually plated on a bed of (I think) hijiki (japanese black pickled seaweed).

The oysters were served poached inside a hollowed-out tangerine in a very delicate broth I can only describe as tangerine water - superb.

Fish quality for sushi and sashimi courses was excellent.  Though kaiseki is usually mostly pre-fixe - there were several options for many of the courses, and thus most folks can customize an evening to their personal tastes.  

Go here!  Your next-best option is to fly to Japan...  We certainly will be returning."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Awesome!
This place will make any occasion very special.

syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"My husband and I dined at Yoichi's for the first time last night. We had been wanting to try it for months and after reading glowing Yelp reviews, we went with anticipation of a wonderful Japanese kaiseki meal. And we were disappointed. Maybe it was an off night. We are adventurous eaters, we like fish prepared in many forms and my husband has actually lived in Japan. That said, we found many of the fish dishes too ""fishy,"" the texture of some of the fish was mushy, and many of the sauces overly sweet.  We were interested to learn that while Yoichi's uses some local seafood and meat (rockfish, urchin) much of their seafood is flown in from Japan and their Wagu comes from Australia.  I think the ingredients may have suffered as a result of the trip. The Central Coast area is blessed with beautiful fresh seafood and cattle is raised here locally. It boggles the mind why a restaurant in Santa Barbara would fly ingredients in from Japan that would be much fresher if procurred locally."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"My husband decided to take a chance on Yoichi's for a date night and wow are we glad we did! The omakase style is definitely going to appeal to more adventurous eaters who are ready to try seven courses with limited options. I don't eat shell fish but the waitress (and kitchen staff) were very accommodating, allowing me to order sushi a la carte while my husband enjoyed the entire experience. They were (at the time of our visit) still awaiting their liquor license, which would ordinarily be a bummer for us, but the waitress was completely up front about this on the phone and we enjoyed free tea all evening. The dining experience is elegant and thoughtful, each dish comes beautifully plated. My husband raved about all of his courses and those that I tried (homemade tofu, marinated mountain veggies, sashimi) were truly a cut above. My tuna sushi was better than any I have had in Santa Barbara, hands down. I would genuinely recommend anyone interested in food to try Yoichi's. It's a gem."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Seriously, half full on a Saturday? Santa Barbara, you better get moving or you are going to lose this place. It should be booked up 6 months in advance. Or you can wait and have to travel to Nobu in Tokyo if they don't make it. Does that make sense to you? Far and away the best overall dining experience in Santa Barbara, if not the greater part of the coast."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Very good sushi!  We ordered 3 bento boxes plus another roll.  Bento was 7 different fish/scallop/uni sashimi.  We got a fish fritter, rice, cooked fish, salad.  For $35 this is a good value for such quality.

Service was friendly and efficient, with recommendations included in the ordering process.

Currently the regular menu is not available due to Covid."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"A friend recommended this place- it seems very authentic.

The sushi + steamed rockfish were amazing. But the sushi is only 3 pieces. 

Everything else was underwhelming and the biggest issue I had is that the only option on the menu is a fixed menu that is $100 per person. It's pretty expensive for the experience you get."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"We called a week in advance to book a reservation to eat here. They took my partners's name, phone number, credit card information, and everything. We don't live in the Santa Barabara area and drove all the way down here just to have a meal at this place. When we called, the woman who answered the phone all of a sudden says that we don't have a reservation?! We have the call history of us making the reservation a week prior. We spent the entire day at Santa Barbara walking around just waiting to have this meal. I don't think you can imagine how disappointed we are right now. A waste of our time and gas. For a restaurant that's so highly rated and highly priced, you'd think they would be organized enough not to mess a reservation up. This is HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Please Please Yoichi don't ever leave us.  This was the best fish and 7 course meal I've ever experienced in my life.  I love Japanese food but this was over the top.  The black cod was to die for and each dish was a work of art.   I just hope people figure out that you belong to Santa Barbara forever.  Loved it.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,I wouldn't recommend this place for sushi. Lady was rude and said we couldn't be seated since they had reservations and only two tables had customers. I was a paying customer and did not see other people rushing in to get sushi. I will never step into this place for sushi. This was my worst experience for sushi. NO THANKS!
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Michelin star rating has to be on its way! This restaurant is amazing, and the service was just as good. It is a small restaurant off of State street. Chef Kawabata and his wife Mogi leave no stone unturned and make this one of the best dining experiences around. 

We started with a great palette cleanser, pickled veggies, wagyu beef, an incredible Japanese snail, then delicious soup, sashimi, oysters, black cod, rock fish, King crab, more sushi and dessert. Every dish had amazing flavor and was unbelievably fresh.  

Yes, it is pricey, but if you are cost conscious for the type of experience you get at Yoichi's then go to the McDonald's on State street. 

This is an experience you must have at least once."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Every dish in this carefully crafted seven course Japanese meal is well thought out and executed. The flavors are well balanced and allow the high quality local and Japanese fish, meat, and produce to shine. Pair with sake recommended by the expert servers and enjoy a beautiful meal."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Their bento is delicious! The fish was so fresh. Highly recommend doing their takeout bento during COVID. The rice balls were just ok for me (personal preference). We're already planning our next order.

Call in advance to order your bento for pickup. They sell out!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Authentic Japanese food that may not sit well with everyones American taste profile, but this place is as close to actually being in Japan as you can get. Worth every penny (and it is expensive), but it is an experience not to be missed."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Quick Summary
Cozy Japanese restaurant that offers Kaiseki (prix fixe) with excellent service. Try to book reservations a few weeks in advance. The service and atmosphere were excellent. Appetizers were excellent. But the entrees and dessert were average. Was very excited to try this restaurant, but was disappointed, probably due to high expectations

Food- 4 stars
The Kaiseki was 7 courses. Started out well with the appetizers but flounded towards the finish line

The appetizers prior to sashimi were all very good and thought out. I would give it 5 stars to start

The sashimi and sushi that came before and after the grilled and steamed dish were good and fresh. Slight compliant that the fish was slightly colder than desired

The grilled and steamed dishes (which you have 3 options each) was when things began to somewhat unravel

-Grilled lobster with tama miso sauce- the lobster was cooked perfectly, but the miso sauce was overly sweet. The balance was pretty off, which was disappointing because the lobster tail was cooked perfectly

-Wagyu- I can see why a few reviewers mentioned it tasted like sausage. It was pretty disappointing

-Seafood steamed in citrus bowl with miso bechamel sauce- it was interesting seeing this plate served in an orange bowl. However, the sauce was so gelatinous and heavy that it was not an enjoyable experience

-Fresh water eel and monkfish liver- was really disappointed that there was bones in the eel and that the monkfish liver lacked any flavor. The whole dish was overly sweet

Dessert- it was a mochi crepe with fruit sort of dessert. It was good, but would've better if served hot or warm

Service- 5 stars
Phenomenal service. Very accommodating without being too overbearing. 

Ambiance/Value- 5 stars
It's a small neighborhood restaurant that makes for a great date night

Bottom Line
Perhaps Yoichi's catered too much to Western tastes, as the food ventured towards Fusion Japanese and didn't satisfy. The appetizers were great, but it went downhill when it got to the grilled and steamed dishes. Will add an extra star for their service and ambiance"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"A bit pricey, but this was authentic Japanese.  Everything was fresh and high quality.  Best Japanese meal that I've had, since Japan!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"When I ate here we had the traditional 7 course meal. Some of the cuisine was not to my taste, it was more traditional and perhaps more for the adventurous eater than I was used to. However, what really disappointed me was the severe case of food poisoning I got after eating here. I was sick starting in the night and it caused me to miss work the next day. I will not be coming back, and sadly would not recommend this restaurant. 

Regardless of the shortcomings of the meal, the service was really excellent."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"This is a mixed feeling review:
* The food was good, as was the quality of the ingredients.
* Here is the turn-off: When a restaurants have 3 choices of white wine (All happen to be Chardonnay at $56, $86, and $160) and the head server tells you ""I really don't like the $56 bottle"" and subtly makes you feel like a cheap jerk when you order it, I say
-- Either get rid of the wine and replace it with one that you CAN recommend to your guests.
-- Or have a talk with your server about pressure up-selling."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Sublime food, kind, polite and attentive staff, this jewel of a traditional Japanese restaurant is well worth taking in if you live in or are visiting Santa Barbara. The other superior (5 star/red) reviews here are right on the money. Even though they are waiting for their liquor license to be approved, there is an unexpected upside to not having one. The diner gets to experience the full measure of the subtle and extraordinary flavors of the food served without the dampening effect of alcohol on the tongue. Yoichi's is an experience not to be missed."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I love Kaiseki, and Yoichi's is one of the best.  The restaurant itself is located in a residential neighborhood and doesn't look like much.  But the food is amazing, and that's what you're here for.  The dishes are authentic and the presentation is phenomenal.  Everything is either locally fresh or flown in from Japan specifically for the dish.   It's a must try if you're in the area!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Some people say this is the finest restaurant between San Francisco and Los Angeles. I'm not inclined to disagree! Not only is each dish in the set menu and exquisite masterpiece in itself, but the chef even makes the place you were eating off of in his own ceramics studio. He's also a collector of Japanese woodblock prints, several displayed inside the Tony restaurant. You'll need to be an omnivore because there is no choice of menu but it is relentlessly delicious delightful and surprising. Each meal is different, depending on what's available, and it's really worth it!!!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Where do I even begin with this... so I'm ""a little behind"" on making this review. I was here when this place was in its grand opening stage. And I must say if you're looking for a true food experience, this place is a must try. If you're looking for a traditional sushi counter, flinging knives and sake bombs, move along.

However, as mentioned before, if you're looking for a true food experience, do yourself a favor and order the kaiseki. 

Service was great! Every plate that came out was briefly introduced and neatly placed. Every course was a progression in tastes and textures. 

Keep up the good work!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,This was such a great experience the best service ever! Its like they were reading my mind. Id want to ask something and they tell me before i can even speak. My water cup was never not full. But the food was amazing cooked/prepped to perfection.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Went again this month and good and service are still excellent. Cost is now $125 per person but still well worth it.  They now serve a good selection of sakes too.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"We enjoyed the kaiseki dinner last night and we were not disappointed.  Absolutley a treat for the eyes nose and mouth.  Each course would come to the table with a bit of trepidation and excitement.  Beautiful and so delicately flavored.  Wow!  One of our group could not eat fish or shellfish, if I had known and called ahead it would have been no problem.  It was no problem.  Chef Yoichi created a 7 course meal on the spot for our guest and it was just as beautiful and tasty as the standard kaiseki.  Wonderful meal and thank you so much for the experience."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I'm a fan of Japanese food and had the pleasure of trying a few Kaiseki meal. This meal is pretty authentic and for the price, it was definitely worth it. $100/person is pretty good for Kaiseki meal. 

Usually Kaiseki meal just gives you what the chef prepares but this meal actually lets you pick from 2-4 options for each category: soups, grilled dish, and steamed dishes. 

My favorite was the soup. I got the sea eel and egg cake soup and my husband got the momotaro tomato soup. Both provided a refreshing light flavor. 

While the food was good, I had a few dislike in terms of flavor. The grilled top shell was way too salty but grilled king crab was tasty. The oyster in orange bowl was beautiful but the orange peel bitterness leaked into the dashi broth giving a moderately bitter after taste. I was not a big fan of this. Another dislike was the poor choice of Sake. The moderately dry sake was recommended to us by the waiter but I find it very bitter and hard to drink. I ended up avoiding the sake all night. 

The desert was green tea custard with a plum. This was very good and provided a great finish taste to the meal. 

Service was attentive and detailed. We constantly had refill of tea and dishes were clear at the right timing. We were given very detailed explanation of each dish. 

I would recommend trying this if you haven't try a Kaiseki meal. This is probably the cheapest decent Kaiseki meal you can find."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"The multi-course kaiseki dinner was quite good but as expected the portions were small and the prices very high. Furthermore, the restaurant is lodged in a bare and dreary room entirely devoid of decoration. Given the high prices a more agreeable atmosphere would be desirable. Overall, a disappointing experience."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"Admittedly having worked at a Japanese restaurant overseas ( with an all Japanese staff) I set the bar quite high when it comes to their cuisine.
This is by far the biggest disappointment I have experienced! Roughly 1/5 of the take away Bento Box was even eatable ;-(
If you hunger for overly smoked soggy vegetables then this is your place...missed the pickled veggies, the tofu cake had the texture of cardboard, the rice, ( OMG how can you screw up rice?!) was simply lacking in any flavor, a bowl of good quality Japanese sushi rice which I luckily had at home ) could have saved the day, the salmon was over cooked / dry, crab and white fish uneatable, sea bass yummy ( finally something to eat!) the washu beef was tender, duck ( which I normally love) I left after the first bite, was this box of ???? worth any where near $40.? dream on...honestly I know better places to eat Japanese in town for way less.
My advice drop the Bento Box and wait until you can offer again your normal fare, which people seem to like.
Me, no sorry I will not be rolling the dice again to the tune of $100. a pop when I can enjoy excellent Japanese cuisine at other establishments."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Fixed price Japanese. Small, intimate place. Delicious yuzu sake to start. Small bites and scrumptious. Enjoyed a bottle of special winter blend of sake."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Very nice Kaiseki fixed menu dinner. Very authentic and traditional. very high quality ingredients Excellent service. My favorite is the sashimi dish, the Madai and Shima-Aji were out of this world. Nice reasonable Sake. 
It's fairly expensive and would like to have more high quality Nigiri."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I spent 1 full day in Santa Barbara, and wanted this for my fancy meal. When I arrived, the host asked if it was my first time, and made sure I understood that it was a set meal and that it'd be $100 per person. 

I've never tried Kaiseki before but have been wanting to as I deeply appreciate the Japanese culture's love for presentation. You eat with your eyes first.

There are 7 courses, and there are some options you can pick from.

1. Zensai (Appetizer): You can choose from Wagyu Beef or Braised Pork Belly. This was artfully arranged with other non-meat items like mochi, abalone, tofu, pickled seaweed etc. Beautiful!!

2. Owan (Soup): You can choose between a sea eel one or a tomato one. They're both in the same clear broth, just different contents. I chose the eel one, and it came in a very large bowl. I left it on the table to sip from as the other courses came one by one.

3. Mukouzuke (Sashimi): The good stuff. This night had Mr Fuji Salmon, Shima Aji (Striped Jack) from Kyushu Island, and Ika (squid) from Hokkaido. I've never tried the striped jack before, so this was really unique to me. It was a very firm fish that had the buttery taste of yellowtail. It was also presented in a beautiful basket.

4. Yakimono (Grilled Dish): You can choose between Black Miso Cod, Lobster, Grilled Top Shell, or Grilled Sweet Fish. I chose the black miso cod, and while it was good, I felt it was too safe. I should've gotten the top shell.

5. Mushimono (Steamed Dish): You can choose from Oyster, Rock Fish, Eel, or Sweet Fish with Roe. I went TOO adventurous with this one, and went with the waiter's recommendation of the Sweet Fish. This was the only course I didn't finish, because I didn't like the texture and sweet taste of this fish at all. Not to mention the weird texture of the fish eggs bursting from its belly. :( 

6. Shokuji (Sushi):  There were 3 pieces. I assume this changes nightly but I had the Santa Barbara Uni (yumm), Scallop, and Crab. Very fresh.

7. Kanmi (Dessert): You choose between 3 puddings. Green Tea, Sesame or Strawberry. I chose the sesame and it was delicious! It comes with a tiny fruit, which is supposedly a peach. It looks like the mini japanese plums but this one is sweet. 

I was completely stuffed afterwards. They also have a 4 course option Tues-Thurs for $65 if you're a lighter eater. 

They also had wonderful matcha tea that I had them keep filling my cup with. A wonderful experience and would love to go to another kaiseki!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I had read about Yoichi in a couple of online articles, saying that it was one of the new standout restaurants in Santa Barbara. They are a small restaurant that requires reservations and can seat about 24 comfortably. I called earlier the same day for a reservation for two at 6:00, and they were easily able to accommodate. They serve a traditional 7 course Kaiseki dinner that can vary depending on the season and what is available from Japan. The seven courses are appetizers, soup, sashimi, grilled dish, steamed dish, sushi, and dessert. Out of those courses, the ones that stood out the most were the appetizers and the steamed dishes. One of the appetizers in particular, was the standout dish of the evening. It was a seasonal fish roe in a sweet broth that was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. The only misstep we had during dinner was that my order for the duck breast steamed dish was mistakenly replaced with the steamed rock fish. However, our waitress was very apologetic when we informed her of the mistake and even comped us a bottle of sake that we ordered; awesome customer service! She also gave us a couple of complimentary glasses of a new yuzu sake that they recently added to their collection, after learning that my wife and I had just gotten married over the weekend. Overall, this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in Santa Barbara and will definitely come back during my next trip!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Love this restaurant!  Hands down best authentic Japanese cuisine in Santa Barbara.  Normally they serve Kaiseki style meals that are incredible.  During covid lockdown they are doing take out bento boxes.  So fresh and so clean.  From pickled veggies, seasoned egg, and rice triangles to cooked fish or meat of the day and a very generous serving of sashimi, including uni on a shiso leaf.  Best take out ever!  Support your local restaurants during covid, including Yoichi."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Superb dinner! Excellent Sake! Great service! 
Our family celebrated an important birthday and Yoichi's was the perfect venue.  We had a great variety of dishes on this beautiful Kaiseki menu.  The three Sake's we had paired perfectly with the food and the service was just right.  We highly recommend this restaurant
and we can't wait for another opportunity to have a dinner, and it doesn't have to be for a special birthday."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"If you are at all a connoisseur of Japanese food, and even more the cuisine of the Kansai region, this is worth the trip to Santa Barbara from just about anywhere on the west coast. This is NOT a ""sushi place"" so don't come here if that's what you're looking for - kaiseki (懐石) is a very traditional Japanese multi-course meal, which incorporates sushi but also other dishes like soups and grilled or braised fish. 

Have been to Yoichi's several times at different times of the year, and each time at least one (sometimes all) of the courses caused us to stop, stare wide-eyed at each other, and ask how we were tasting something so impossibly unique and delicious. Yoichi has more than once prepared meals that were better than what I had during years traveling in Japan. The fish is unbelievably fresh, the taste and texture is absolutely perfect, and each meal is seasonal, inventive yet in keeping with traditional kaiseki, and flows perfectly together. The sake pairings are always spot on as well. How they don't yet have a Michelin star is beyond me."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I took my boyfriend to Yoichi's on a Sunday which to my surprise was the same day where Chef Yoichi was celebrating his Birthday; he and his family were having dinner here which was refreshing since he prides his restaurant so much he'd eat there too!

 I reserved for a booth at 8:30 for two and the sweet lady that served us knew I was Marina who had requested a table.

In terms of location, Yoichi's is off the beaten path, two and a half blocks from state street. You would need to look up the address to find it, otherwise the common tourist wouldn't be familiar about the location. Also, parking is side street and rarely is there parking on the same block (we had to walk a full block to get there!).

SERVICE -

Service was amazing in terms of Santa Barbara, the best I've had. As we entered the quaint little restaurant with lights flowing down the building, everyone bowed at us and was very kind. Our server was very nice and attentive, she kept checking on us regularly.  She was quite knowledgeable about every dish on the menu, I had felt like I was quizzing her as I asked about the different assortments of the foods and I think she was very good. 

FOOD -

My boyfriend and I have similar tastes but wanted to try other dishes to have more of a variety when we dined so we both ordered the Kaiseki 7 course meal. The restaurant has a nice selection of sake as well as wine. I ordered a bottle of their Gasanryu Hazuki Sake (which was very smooth and had a soft texture with a bold and fruity flavor as if it were freshly squeezed), and it surprisingly worked very well with the Kaiseki courses. 

We had the following: Zensai's (assorted appetizers) of Mozuku seaweed and jelly fish with shiso sauce, the simmered abalone, the deep fried tofu and vegetable balls siimmered in bonito broth, the shansho pepper sauce glazed grilled on wagyu beef, and the braised pork belly with moromi miso. 

For the Owan (second course/soup) we tried both soups of clear soup with sea eel, and egg cake; and, my boyfriend had the clear soup with whole steamed tomato.

For our Yakimono (grilled dish) we had the choice of the grilled, miso marinated black cod and the sweet soy sauce marinated grilled duck breast.

For our Mushimono (steamed & simmered dish) I ordered their Japanese rock fish simmered in sweet broth and my boyfriend's choice was of the gorgeous Arima Sansho pepper marinated sweet fish with Its roe inside.

And lastly for the Kanmi, or dessert we both ordered their sweet Green tea ice cream with a wedge of dried but tasty persimmons, I had the chance to eat both of them!

My boyfriend's favorite was the pork belly, because of the consistency and rich flavor. His clam soup was delectable too and also the Cod, he says he could have eaten that all day long! My boyfriend ordered their wagyu for his main course, and while his wagyu was nicely cooked, I felt the seasoning was somewhat uneven.

My favorite was the sweet soy sauce marinated grilled duck breast because the sweet soy sauce was rich and yet rustic without being overwhelming to my palate. While the duck breast was just a little bit on the salty side, I did really like the texture of the meat, which worked very well with the soy sauce and garnish on top. 

I would definitely recommend coming here again. I think that Yoichi's is the best Japanese restaurant in Santa Barbara if you're looking for legitimate sushi food that wouldn't be too westernized like what is usually seen on state street. Yoichi's is the crème de la crop of what Santa Barbara has to offer in terms of an authentic Japanese meal."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Love the artistic Bento box they making during Covid. So filling with so many flavors. I can tell in each bite the fish and duck, steak all so high quality.
Hard to get such a high quality meal experience during the Pandemic. It's so worth it! 
They just spoil my palette."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"The seafood is sooooo fresh. Although it might be one of the most expensive restaurants in SB, 100 for one person, the food and service deserve it. Each one could have seven courses, with choice for entree, soup, grill and sushi. My favorite is the black cod! Can't believe it could be so fresh as well as so tasty! I have been here two times this month and found that they changed their menu a little. Really recommend!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"I am a huge fan of kaiseki, unfortunately this isn't really comparable of anything you can get in Japan. The first course started off amazing, then it went downhill from there. 

The thoughts are nice, but the absence in details was annoying. There are better ways to spend $100. Also that strange french decor added to the annoyance b/c I was expecting perfection."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"My husband and I just got done dining at Yoichi's. Friday night and we were one of three tables there - should have seen that as a sign. We typically love Japanese food but this was not good. Everything had an overly fishy taste, the textures were off, and the portions were small. We constantly felt like we were choking down the food vs enjoying a new experience. The grilled and steamed items were chewy while the fresh items tasted and smelled like something out of an old fish market. The other yelp reviews had me believe this would be a life changing meal and the only thing it changed was my desire to ever come back here again. I can't believe how much we had to pay for this food. Do your research before you go!!!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Love, love, love this restaurant.  Wonderful seven course diner. We went twice and the menu changed slightly between the two visits.  Everything is perfectly fresh, well cooked and delicious.  The black cod is AMAZING.  Lovely owners, nice server and now they have the temporary ABC license.  What a wonderful addition to the Santa Barbara food scene.  And excellent value for money."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I don't usually leave reviews but when I do it's either really bad or really good and this? This is really good. Remember that it's 100$ okay? If you think the ""interior decorating"" takes away from the food get over yourself. 

The best Kaiseki I have ever had for the price and family owned to boot. The owner is the chef and his wife is helps in the front! So cool to have such a personable experience.

I died and went to heaven 7 times (cuz 7 courses). Super light and amazing ingredients. I had a chance to eat junsai otherwise known as Japanese water shield because it was in season and wow was that an experience. So light and what an interesting texture. Overall an unpretentious and delicious meal. 

Do yourself a favor and go."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Why did this place not exist during my UCSB days? We had an amazing kaiseki experience here! So glad we tried this place on a spontaneous trip back to Santa Barbara earlier this year. They keep their website updated with the current courses so you know exactly what you're getting. I love that there are multiple grilled & steamed dishes for you to choose from. Our party of 3 selected different options in both categories. Everything was high quality and the owner/server made our experience very enjoyable. We were impressed with the amount of thought in every dish. My favorites were the sea urchin & sweet shrimp.

Looking forward to go back once they reopen!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Last time trying Kaiseki was in Kyoto Japan and I enjoyed it tremendously. I was glad to find out that Yoichi's offers Kaiseki and I don't have to fly across the Pacific. As a fan of authentic Japanese traditional cuisine, I could not pass up on this opportunity. It was a great find during my visit in the lovely city of Santa Barbara.

There is definitely a difference when using all five senses of touch, smell, taste, sight, and hearing. The presentation and simplicity says plenty. The main ingredient of each dish were never overpowered but accentuated. Each course is presented with an introduction. 

The staff is friendly just like the service you get in Japan. The experience was unforgettable. Thank you Yoichi's!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Every one of the seven courses my husband and I enjoyed were amazing!  From the appetizer with the perfectly seasoned lobster to the mochi dessert the flavors, textures and presentation were perfect.  Cannot wait to come back."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Traditional Japanese multi courses dinner. Menu is mostly preset with 2 of the 7 courses offering choices. The food was excellent, and the service very attentive. A great restaurant for a special occasion. We will be back."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Wow, just one of the best experiences I've had ever. Not just because the food was amazing (because it totally was), but also the ambiance and customer service were so on point. We came here for my fiancé's birthday and we were blown away by every course. Definitely a must try when visiting SB!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Came for the Kaiseki a few weeks ago, and overall had a really great meal for two. 

Service is very attentive as it should be, and the explanations the waitresses give for each dish helps to appreciate and understand what you're eating next.

Every dish was well made, my personal favorites were the Black Cod Soup and Sashimi course. The portion of the full course is well planned out - we were both nicely full after dessert. Though some courses are smaller, the steamed and grilled dishes tend to be larger.

Still, I would say they left space to improve purely in the sense that for charging 135/person, people expect to be mindblown. I thought the oysters inside an orange was the most creative dish of the night but nothing particularly surprised me.

I will be back in the future when they change up the menu for seasonality again!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Fan of authentic Japanese food & real sushi? Amazing new restaurant in SB called ""Yoichi's""... High quality ingrédients, some flown in from Japan like their wagyu beef and certain fish for the sushi... The chef is an artist that takes great pride in his craft, former head chef at Nobu Tokyo... Try this place, order the delicious ""Kaiseki"" menu, tastes for every palate and a burst of flavor in every bite, true art... The Japanese simply have the best taste of any culture on earth fantastic meal in intimate setting off the zoo that is State st. Merci Chef Yoichi! As a lifelong Santa Barbaran, I appreciate more and more the authentic, quality restaurants in SB that are rarer & rarer, Yoichi's caters to locals and not tourists. Perfect for a date night or a get together with friends, service was excellent as well, very friendly staff & owners. We need more places like Yoichi's in SB with fantastic food, less tourist traps with mediocre food & service. Yoichi's THANK you for coming to SB, perfect meal, real taste Japan in SB!!!! The sushi was phenomenal similar to Chef Jiro in Tokyo watch ""Jiro dreams of sushi"" on NFLX"". Just like in Tokyo, real sushi made with the highest quality fish not gooped up with sauces like Sakana or other places in Cali. Yoichi's sashimi was also OUT OF THIS WORLD, maybe the best I've tasted in USA. I did visit Japan twice, and Yoichi's has brought Japan to Cali. Thank you so much..."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"A wonderful experience with great service and innovative dishes. My husband and I had been wanting to try a traditional Japanese kaiseki meal, so we were pretty excited to visit Yoichi's. 

It was our first and only kaiseki experience, so we don't have much to compare it to, but we did enjoy almost everything we ordered. 

I won't list every dish, just the ones that stood out to us. Our favorites were the matcha-marinated sweet fish, and Japanese top shell, both of which were items from the grilled course. We also enjoyed the sushi trio at the end (ikura, Santa Barbara uni, and toro). Our least favorite would be the sashimi as I'm sure they were extremely fresh, but were served too cold..to the point where it almost tasted like frozen fish that you may have at a less fancy sushi spot. 

Overall, our experience was memorable and we enjoyed our meal. The only minor drawback was perhaps that I expected a little more for what the meal cost. Especially from the dessert round, as well as sashimi. But, it's a minor issue, as almost everything was created and presented so thoughtfully. 

Yoichi's has definitely opened up our curiosity and desire to try more kaiseki-style cuisine. 
Next up, n/naka!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This is a fantastic restaurant.  I think it will have several Michelin stars once it is discovered.  You should go now before they raise the prices 2-3x and have the oyster dish, which would be at home on the menu at le bernadin."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Refined is the word that comes to mind when describing our kaiseki experience at Yoichi's. Every dish is thoughtfully prepared, with attention to detail and balanced, nuanced flavors. 

Standouts were the cod (heaven), oyster in a tangerine shell (make sure to get a spoon to drink that amazing broth), and the mochi that was served for dessert. 

My husband described the meal as fresh and clean... which is definitely how the sushi and sashimi tasted. 

Service was elegant and unintrusive- but always on top of things. 

Definitely try this if you're looking for a rare experience w Japanese cuisine. If you're looking for a fancy omakase type place (which I also love), this isn't it... but the flavors and experience are one of a kind for sure."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"We had a wonderful meal at Yoichi's that truly felt like an authentic experience in Japanese cuisine. The customer service was impeccable from the moment we walked and maintained consistent throughout our entire dining experience. 

We each ordered the 7 course kaiseki menu. Every dish was delicate and delectable! We're lucky to have a restaurant of this caliber in Santa Barbara. The seafood is as fresh as it gets in this town. Follow Yoichi's on Facebook to see pictures of the daily catch or imports coming in. 

For my party, 7 courses was not quite enough to leave feeling full, but we were satisfied. I do wish the portions were slightly larger or there were a few more courses to fully round out the meal and not leave you hungry at the end. 

It was my birthday when we went and our waiter, Zack, sang the most beautiful, soulful, a cappella rendition of the birthday song that I've ever heard! Thank you Zack! I felt so special! 

Pro tip: Ask if you can keep a menu with you at the table so you can know what you're eating and accurately caption your picture on Yelp! (Unlike, me;)"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This was an extraordinary dining experience. Hubby and I were supposed to go to L.A. and our plans fell through. I was so bummed, I said, ""screw it, were finally going to try a kaiseki experience"". So we got in the car and drove to Santa Barbara (made a reservation first). Their menu is seasonal, so they had a lot of summer ingredients like fresh corn and clear dashi. Everything was delicious. The assortment of appetizers was just a few bites of really delicious food. We had a mackerel with purple yam, sort of like poi but solid. Very good. There was also foie gras and a shot of lake vegetables. Delicious. We each had a different soup. My husband's had a soft egg and mine had noodles, I think. The sashimi course was fantastic, of course. Ther was a lovely calamari steak and salmon and a few others I don't remember the name of. But, everything was so fresh, we took our time and savored it. When I thought they wouldn't be able to top the sashimi, they brought out this gorgeous custard in a dashi broth topped with steamed fish and shrimp and an assortment of mushrooms also in broth served in an orange cup. For our meat course, my husband got the black cod which is always a favorite. I had a delicious duck breast with sweet soy marinade and pink peppercorns.  They did  between courses we sipped on sake and Japanese beers I had never seen before (Echigo). The total bill for 2 was $290 before tip. If it stays affordable, I plan to visit every season."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I guess I can keep this review short and simple. if you appreciate a long, predefined, high-quality 7 course sushi dinner and you are willing to spend some money for it, this is the place to be in Santa Barbara. 

There a plenty of ""normal"" or even ""modern-fancy"" sushi place in town where you order your ordinary stuff (not bad stuff, don't get me wrong here), eat and pay - all within an hour. if you prefer that, you should not go to Yoichi's. 

My wife and I are willing to invest money and time in a good sushi dinner and we have done that all around the world. This place is clearly on of the best places we have been so far (probably just topped by a 2 Michelin Star sushi restaurant in Dusseldorf/Germany and a place in Oslo/Norway, which was voted to be among the top 10 sushi restaurants outside of Japan).

Be open as you cannot pick an choose. The courses are set so if you have any doubts check the menu first and talk to the waiter/chef. I am sure they will give you some good advise whether that day's menu satisfies your taste."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Four stars was generous since the food was five stars, but the ambience is 2.5 stars and lack of a liquor license 1 star. The food was exceptionally amazing, but at a set $85 a pop with no alternatives, I wish them well in this SB market. The ambience is sparse and overlit with piano elevator music. Boring, unromantic, and non-offensive like a senior assisted-living cafeteria. I gave it 3 stars for being clean. Hopefully they will get their liquor license next month and we can all loosen up a bit."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"The best restaurant in Santa Barbara- hands. down. My partner and I got a waitlisted spot tonight, and we could not be more impressed. First, the quality of the food here was the only even remotely comparison to that of Japan. We felt like we were back in Shinjuku and Kyoto experiencing local Japanese cuisine. Second, you should go for the small-space, romantic vibe. The place is very small, which makes the experience all that more intimate. Finally, you must go for the service. As if we were in a high end restaurant in Japan, the staff were so knowledgeable about the food, friendly to us, and made the entire experience just feel good. A must-do for SB locals for a special occasion."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Ordered the take out bento box and it was phenomenal. Very impressed with the quality and quantity.
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"This place was insanely good. It was quite possibly one of the best bites of food I've ever had in my entire life. I went here in June and I am still thinking about the food and I think I can still remember most of what I ate.

1 - the zensai had three elements: seafood, beef, and vegetables. Each representing the ocean, plains, and mountains respectively. The seafood (shrimp, abalone, and octopus) was amazing, each having distinct flavor and texture and was so interesting paired with the gelatinous chicken soup. The pickled vegetables were the highlight of this course. They were extremely flavorful and refreshing. 

2 - the owan was hands down the most delicate and flavorful soup I have ever had in my entire life. I legit still vividly remember the taste after months. The soup was a simple katsuobushi dashi that tasted very much like bonito but complex. I think the sesame oil that they finished it with came through with a pleasant nuttiness that didn't overpower the soup but made it more full bodied. The black cod was buttery and tender, still having it's fish characteristics as well. The shiitake mushroom was so umami rich and flavorful, you could taste the tare it was in but it didn't bleed it's flavors to the other parts of the dish in such a way that it overpowered. It just kinda woke you up in a good way. The egg was fun, almost like noodles. The bamboo shoot had a nice crunch that was a good contrast from the rest of the soup and the tomato and sprout introduced a much needed acidity and freshness and brought the whole course together. 

3 - the mukouzuke was also good. We had king mackerel, amberjack, and uni. These were really good cuts of fish and the house made ponzu was really good. I forget which one, but one of these fish were lightly smoked and the other was wrapped in kombu and both these techniques showed through as the kombu made the texture of the fish firmer and the lightly smoked one had a nice aroma to it. The highlight of this dish was the difference in the uni. I've had lots of uni and I am a big advocate for eating local purple urchin that have ravaged our coast. They served uni from hokkaido and santa barbara (I believe both were red urchin). The little hokkaido uni were so much sweeter and now I understand the difference and why people pay a premium for this. I still think eating local uni is more sustainable though!

4 - Ah the yakimono is the reason why this review was a 4 star. When I ordered the wagyu, I was expecting to taste wagyu beef. Instead the slices of meat tasted like chinese sausage. The marinade and cooking process just did not do the beef justice. I wish it was better because I think this dish single handedly made the experience slightly disappointing.

5 - For the shiizakana, I got the freshwater eel. It was a but better than the eel I can get in store but still quite good. I think getting this and the wagyu was a mistake, as their flavor profiles were similar. I should have gotten something that contrasted. The monkfish liver was very interesting and good though!

6 - The shokuji was a nice breath of fresh air after all those sweet meaty dishes. I think the ama ebi was extremely good. Best sweet shrimp I've ever had. It tasted very fresh. The scallop nigiri was also very good! I haven't had scallops served this way and it was pleasant. Finally, the quail egg and yam hit home. It tasted exactly like natto and egg mixed in rice but with a little bit more complexity and freshness. It was inspiring to say the least.

7 - To finish it all off, the kanmi. Honestly, coming into the restaurant, my friends and I were thinking ""oh it's a 6 course meal plus dessert"" just cuz that's kinda how our restaurant experiences were like. But man, we were seriously wrong. The mochi was ridiculously good. The first one with red bean and strawberry was eye-opening. The red bean texture was great and the mochi had just the right amount of sweetness and the texture was nice and chewy. The second one with mint was really good and the mint leaf garnish just tied the two mochi together so well. I never thought I'd have the best mochi in my life at this restaurant. If I could criticize anything, it would be that the plate choice was interesting because the color and shape of the plate kinda clashed with the triangular shape and orange color of the mochi. 

Besides the food, the service was fantastic. I really enjoyed the side conversations we had with the servers. The tea was very good. And they also gave our table enough space to have our own conversations without feeling like we were being hawked over. 

The decor of the place is nice and feels very elegant, but welcoming. 

Overall, can't wait to go again some day! 

I don't have any pictures because my phone camera is broken. You can see the pics in other people's photos though!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Great dinner experience.  While expensive, it isn't too bad for what you're getting if you think about the quality and detail that goes into each plate.  Still, it's not a place you can go to regularly because of the price point.

Quality - the sushi, sashimi, and other seafood were all so fresh and amazing. 

Service - the waitstaff was extremely nice and polite and took the time to explain everything in great detail.

Presentation - It's obvious that it's not easy to cut, cook, prep all the dishes that come out so definitely appreciate that as well.  

I did not try the sake but did appreciate the Japanese microbreweries they had!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,negative,"I give this place a 3.5. Didn't give them the full 4, because i think its just a little bit above OK. 

Came to SB for one night, wanted sushi so I turned to yelp.

I chose this place because I didn't want to dine a sushi restaurant that drenches their fish in sauce & mayo's. I also hoped to eat some Santa Barbara Uni at the most authentic Japanese restaurant SB has to offer. When I came here, there was no Uni. :( 

Set aside from that, I did have a beautiful meal here. It was just a bit boring, and nothing was WOW that I would come back for. I have been to Japan a few times, and I've had amazing kaiseki meals in Vancouver where I live. Based on the experiences I've had else where, I would not come back here to eat.

Food Preparation: 5/5
Freshness: 5/5
Menu Selection (Set Menu): 3/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 3/5

This place is definitely traditional Japanese. The food is prepared well, and there is attention to detail in every dish. However, I felt that the set menu was very limited. I felt that the choices they provided in Kaiseki did not satisfy me, or the things that were good, were very small and short lived. I was always waiting for the next best thing. While every dish tasted as it should, they should have had more ""wow"" items on the menu. The menu was a bit boring for my taste."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,100% would go again. Amazing. Very impressed. I've been to Japan and tried many restaurants and home cooking there. This is traditional Japanese cooking with a cozy hole in the wall vibe. Food includes sushi but they have a variety of traditional Japanese courses. Best part is that you don't have to order and they bring you the best of what they have to offer. Such polite and amazing service. Cannot say more. Thank you for a wonderful time and we will be back!!! Arigato! :)
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,Our family celebrated by mother's 88th birthday at Yoichi.  We wanted a special experience for this auspicious occasion and we were thrilled with the authentic Japanese food and presentation. The staff was wonderful and attentive to my mother (and all of us).  We will visit again!
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"I have eaten at 5 star 5 diamond restaurants but I have never literally cried after eating a meal. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the 7 course tasting and from beginning to end we were absolutely mind blown. 
I couldn't help but be overwhelmed with emotion after enjoying such well crafted courses that were made with the utmost craftsmanship and genuine love for food and culture. 
Please come enjoy what this chef and his staff are doing because they are true artists and geniuses in what they are doing."
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"My go to spot during covid. Their bento boxes were my absolute favorite. There is not one bad thing in each box. Fresh sashimi, miso salmon and black cod, and duck and Wagyu beef. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!"
syuKX2pH3JJhOOppzNI6SA,Yoichi's,Japanese,positive,"Yoichi's is one of the best restaurants I have dined at in the United States. My initial meal here was so superb that I went back a second time and had virtually the same exact meal the very next week. If I actually lived in Santa Barbara and not San Diego, I'd be back at Yoichi's again RIGHT now, and just thinking of this restaurant makes me want to jump in my car and drive 3 1/2 hours to be there.

When I saw reviews of Yelpers claiming to break down into tears of fulfillment and astonishment in the middle of their meal, my B.S. detector went off, but having now been to Yoichi's twice, I get it. Everything here is great, but there are a few very spectacular dishes that transcend greatness - and if there were ever two dishes that are so good I could cry, they would possibly be Yoichi's ""Grilled Duck Breast"" (Kamo no Yuanyaki) and ""Rock Fish in Sweet Broth"" (Kinki no Nitsuke). The former of which features an expertly-grilled duck breast, soft and luscious, with sweet soy sauce caramelized on the meat, and the latter a silky fish in a delectably sticky broth that easily breaks apart on your tongue, imparting its flavor throughout your mouth as it disintegrates into joy itself.

Run by Yoichi Kawabata (Chef, formerly of Nobu Tokyo) and his wife Mogi (Maître d'), Yoichi's offers only one way to dine - for a prix fixe rate of $100, a 7-course Kaiseki dinner. Kaiseki originated in the 16th century as a Japanese tea ceremony. It is about more than food, it is a deliberate presentation of the food across a number of servings, each morsel of which is intricately placed in ceramic plates and bowls specifically chosen for it. Kaiseke is the most refined cuisine of Japan, strictly reflective of the seasons before ""seasonal"" became a thing. Kaiseke is typically ""light"" fare, meant to be paired with sake or tea - but, at Yoichi's, a full Kaiseki dinner will satisfy even the hungriest eaters.

Yoichi's Kaiseki is a mixture of sushi, grilled plates, boiled plates, and (of course) dessert. You do get a few choices on menu options. Aside from the aforementioned dishes, I much enjoyed the Hamaguri Shinjo Sumashijatate (Clear soup with Hamaguri clam fish cake) and the Sakura Buta no Kakuni (Braised Pork Belly) with Moromi Miso, though I'd suggest the Rock Fish over the Pork Belly. Also I suggest pairing with the Denshin Natsu (Junmai Daiginjo Namazake), a seasonal licorice-y sake, and one of my favorites I've had either in or out of Japan. I had the opportunity to meet with two friendly gentlemen from Denshin who co-hosted my complimentary sake tasting during one of my visits here.

For the rest of my meals here, I had over 20 different bites of food, enjoying a variety of specialties including water shields, Japanese sardines, abalone, jellyfish, miso-marinated scallops, simmered taro, local Santa Barbara sea urchin (uni), bluefin tuna, salmon belly, with Japanese ice creams and fruit gelatins for dessert.

I am grateful to Yoichi-sama, Mogi-san, and their staff for putting together such an exceptional dining experience. Both times I ate here were humbling meals, food events that I will treasure and remember always. For those still wondering: put simply, this is THE dinner to drop some money on if you visit Santa Barbara. Don't think twice about it, put yourself in this restaurant's capable hands and prepare to have your mind blown.

Food-Décor-Service: 4.8/3.9/4.6"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Never had sizzling lunch before, but tried this out with a friend! Got the kimchi beef pepper rice since I like kimchi and it was very fulfilling! Had to take home some leftovers. Also the server Angie was super helpful and amazing!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"Came here for lunch today and got the curry beef udon and added an egg. It was super filling and flavorful. I also ordered the chicken wings, which was amazing. The garlic sauce on it was sweet but they only put enough to give the wing a splash of flavor. The service was quick and we got our food fast. The only thing that sucked was they didn't have boba or any milk tea. Other than that it was a good lunch and definitely came out sizzling."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Decided to give this place another shot. Service was much improved and the sizzling rice plates were really good.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"We went here because it was the only place open in Isla Vista on Christmas. It was OK, but I don't see what makes for all the top ratings. The menu is very limited.

We had the Beef Udon. We were not sure what to do when it came out, so we were grateful that the server cooked the beef before the plate cooled too much.

The beef had too much fat for my taste. And you only have maybe 30 seconds to cook it before it stops sizzling. Not enough to burn off the fat.

My wife ordered the Takoyaki appetizer. It was like a bunch of donut holes. We were told they have squid inside. True. But each one had just a tiny bit of squid. It did not seem very wholesome to me as an appetizer. Maybe OK as a dessert.

I had seaweed salad as an appetizer. That was OK. It was seaweed salad.

I might try this place again for the steak if I am ever in the mood for steak (not very often). Otherwise, I think Sushiya is a much better choice for Japanese food in Isla Vista."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Rice is the best option. Very flavorful and lost of seasonings to choose to from. Udon was okay but would recommend the rice dish for the first time.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"I love this place and highly recommend it! There aren't very many Asian food options around the area but this place is one I'll keep on my radar because it hits the spot every time. Compared to the Bay Area location, the quality of the meat is just as good but I do feel that the meat portions are just a bit smaller. The food comes out pretty fast and I like that I'm able to customize the flavor to my liking with the condiments on the table(eg. garlic shoyu, teriyaki sauce, and black pepper). Given that they are a newly opened restaurant, I understand that their customer service/servers are still in training but it is pretty solid(shoutout to Charlie! and Jason! for the excellent customer service). However, I would prefer not to be asked if I wanted water every minute or so and if they changed their cups to reusable cups to be more environmentally friendly. 

For a first timer, the menu could be overwhelming since there are so many yummy options to choose from! I'd recommend the Curry Beef Udon(!!), Curry Beef Rice with Cheese, and Garlic Beef Pepper Rice :)"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Sizzling Lunch is a nice place to eat at. It takes a simple idea and executes it very nicely. You're given a plate of your choice of protein along with a base being rice or noodle served on a sizzling plate. You then proceed to sizzle your meal right before you eat it. I got the Kimchi Beef Fried Rice plate. The meat was fresh and the portions were nice. It left me delightfully and not bloated. In addition the restaurant is clean and the staff is attentive and provides good service and gets you in and out rather quickly. I highly recommend.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Bomb.com 
This place has great flavor and a chill vibe. The staff has great service and they are friendly. The food takes a little while to be served, but the staff is small and they check on you frequently to make sure you have water and are comfortable. So, this wasn't a problem. Not a place to visit if you are in a rush. But if you are in a comfy mood, go here."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"It's one of the best spots to have lunch or dinner with your friends. But don't overdo it on the garlic shoyu sauce on the table, it'll make you're food SUPER SALTY. My favorite thing to get there is either the garlic beef rice plate or the curry beef udon."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Great meal with a deal! $13 for hot sizzling plate of beef, rice, garlic, spices and corn. I opted in for the kimchi which I thought came on the side. It's put on top of the rice. Next time I would get the plate with out the kimchi. Drizzle on the garlic shoyu sauce all over your plate for extra flavor! Let the sliced beef cook to your liking. (Med./ med. rare) then mix. Never had anything like this but a great simple satisfying meal!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Came with a big party of 13 and had a wonderful and efficient service from Jason. The food came out great, he was friendly and responsive, checking in to make sure everything was okay. I ordered the garlic beef pepper rice and the food was delicious too. I would definitely recommend coming here with a big or small party! Perfect place to eat with friends."

eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"I'm honestly so glad Sizzling Lunch opened in IV because there's not many good Asian spots around. It's one of my favorite places to eat at! The vibe of the restaurant is really nice so it makes it a great place to eat with friends and talk.

The first time I came, I got the garlic beef pepper rice and it's so good! Definitely recommend if you like fried garlic because it's so bomb. The meat is pretty bland so make sure to season it! I personally really like the garlic shoyu sauce. It's a great savory flavor. If you like more of a sweet flavor, there's teriyaki sauce (but I personally don't like sweet). 

I also tried the beef udon. I added fried garlic to it (can't resist). The udon noodles were thick and chewy. I usually don't like thick noodles but it's actually really good. Would definitely go back to get it again if I'm ever craving noodles."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"New place! Soooooo good, the flavors are based on how much ever you want to add (Teriyaki or Garlic Shoyu Sauce) WHILE IT SIZZLING! Like a mini KBBQ plate! Cool concept and a great casual place for coworkers and family. Try the Garlic Pepper Beef or the Salmon pepper even better yet grab the wings, well marinated and seasoned!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Went to sizzling lunch on a Saturday around 3 PM. The place wasn't too crowded. The service was super fast and the workers were very friendly. In my opinion I think this is better than pepper lunch which is a more popular chain? But this chain definitely gives you way for beef. Overall the food was really great. I recommend using the sauces on the sides when eating it though because it can be bland. Also flip your beef as soon as you get your food so the beef can cook throughly. 

TIP: check in on yelp for a 10% off your check and pay with cash for an extra 5%"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,i have gone here a couple of times and i think it's a really good addition to iv! the workers were extremely friendly (especially paul!) and the area was clean/well maintained. I recommend either the salmon pepper lunch or the beef udon with garlic add on :D i will continue to frequent here because it is always consistent and satisfying to eat with friends
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"This is seriously my new favorite place to eat in IV :'-) usually restaurants in IV are dirty, have bad service, or just have nasty food in general but this place is extremely clean, the food is fantastic and the service is impeccable. I came in on a day with my friends when the entire place was packed and we all got our food no more than 10 minutes after we sat down. Servers are very helpful and know how to cater to customers in an efficient way. (Shoutout to my server Paul who helped me out last time I went in, and Grace who helped me the second or third time I visited!) I already know this place will be my new go-to for dinner parties and hangouts. Thanks sizzling lunch :-)"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"The food here is always fantastic, and portions are generous! My favorite thing to get is the chicken katsu curry, the katsu always comes out perfectly fried and crunchy and complements the curry wonderfully. They have sauces you can add to the rice (garlic and teriyaki, I believe?) if you would like. Highly recommend!!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Being from LA, I have high expectations for quality and authenticity of food so when I heard about Sizzling Lunch opening up I got so excited to try it and see the hype for myself. 

When I came, the service was already a 
huge improvement than 212 hotpot (what the place was before) where everything was self serve. The waiters were on top of their service and the food came out very quickly. I ordered the garlic beef rice and it was a huge portion for what the price was. Not only that, they have great add ons, I would recommend the egg and cheese! I had the gyoza and takoyaki appetizers which were also pretty good. 

Shoutout to the waiters Jason and Jay for the amazing service! Will definitely be coming back again"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,It was my first time here and I saw that it was a very appealing place. My server was Andy and he had a lot of good recommendations right off the bat and was very quick with the service. I got his recommendation of beef udon with friend garlic and it was really good. I will definitely be coming back soon.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,Very oily and bland. Kinda disappointed because I heard so many good things about this place. My friend got salmon rice bowl. She said it's also very bland.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Really good and unique food! Atmosphere is nice with the sizzling sound coming from everywhere. I had the kimchi beef rice plate and it was very filling and filled with spice , especially with the chili powder. 
The servers are also very proactive in their activities. Christine made sure my water cup was never empty."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,I really like eating here. I recommend all the rice dishes here. Maybe next time I will try noodles.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,I got the special here and there was a lot of food. There was not a lot of flavor but also there wasn't any directions on what add-ins to use. I got a headache after eating this but the service is good. This is a pretty decent experience.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,服務唔錯啦，但係嘢食其實冇expect咁好食，點咗牛肉烏東同埋芝士咖喱牛肉烏冬，牛肉新鮮嘅程度。同埋份量其實唔係好夠。

eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Good atmosphere and the employees are all really nice. The portions are really filling and would definitely recommend this new place if you want some good Asian food in IV. Shoutout to our server Jason, 10/10"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,I've been waiting for this place to open and I finally ate here with my family. Best experience! The server explained how it works. When the food came out my sisters were in the restroom and they were asking if they wanted to mix it. They also kept refilling our waters. Hell yeah! Best service. Kimchi pepper rice and curry rice with cheese was amazing love it!
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"I've been craving good Asian food in Isla Vista since I first moved here, and sizzling lunch has finally fulfilled that. The curry beef udon was delicious, although I would recommend adding a bit of the garlic shoyu or chili powder for that extra flavor. The service was also amazing - everyone was super kind and energetic, and our server Christine checked in multiple times to make sure we were doing well (: Finally, Niki is my icon, so I absolutely loved the music selection as well. Overall a really solid place, and one that I'll be visiting again soon!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"Food was decent. Service was poor. Appetizer showed 12 pc fish ball, we received 6 pc. 3 tables that were sat after we have our order received their order, ate, and left before our food arrived. We had to track down a server to check our order, to get our receipt, and to charge our card. I probably won't be back again."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Been here twice and it's delicious! Very consistent! Also they give discounts if you check in or use cash! Definitely coming again!!!!!
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"This is my second time coming here and the service has been great all around. They constantly came and ask if we were doing okay and refilled our drinks frequently. The food additionally came out in a timely manner and was still hot when it came out. The tables and utensils were clean. Their proportions are also pretty generous. My friend and i both couldn't finish our meal so overall, great experience and highly recommend this place to grab a bite!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,got the beef udon and and the beef pepper rice. both were really good. personally liked the udon the best. good portions and pretty good service. would recommend :0)
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Great food and service. Staff here were friendly and accommodating to helping me make a choice for my first time here!
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Food is so great! I love pepper steak and fried rice. This is a most excellent combination. Add a fried egg, or even two! It makes it over the top!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,Meh. Sub par service and bland food. Wouldn't go back. Walked in and got seated. A bigger party walks in. They move us to the corner even though there is plenty of seating elsewhere for the party. Food came out quickly but it was a tasteless mess. Great if you're a college kid on a budget. But look elsewhere if you are looking for good noodles.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Sizzling Lunch is always a good option with friends (: 
Their service is relatively quick and the food never takes long to come out."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Food was great . Sizzling hot on your table . Service was great food ,came quick and the restaurant was very clean ."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"i have taken my girlfriend here twice and lemme tell u... it hits. try the beef udon, u will THANK ME

for real tho this place js really really good"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,The server Jason was really nice! Great service and food. I ordered the Garlic beef rice and it was absolutely delicious. Make sure to come here ! (':
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"First of all, shout out to that waiter who took the orders for a party of six and decided to give the whole story, the whole spiel as to why Sizzling Lunch replaced 212° and why it's so much better than Pepper Lunch. (Seriously, ""sizzling"" sounds better than ""pepper"" lol.) on the real though, thanks fellow waiter/Gaucho for the follow ups to getting our meals. I absolutely loved the portions, the price was pretty okay for IV, and how my party felt welcomed. Kimchi on any of the dishes and an egg is bomb! Will be coming back hehe"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"My server, Jason, was incredible. They gave great portions, were super speedy with service and very attentive. Would definitely recommend!!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"So much better than that stupid hotpot place 212. 11/10 recommend this restaurant for any diner looking for a fulfilling meal. Usually, I have a problem of having either too much to eat or not too much. This hits the spot. One of the servers, Paul, such a solid dude. Servers are kind and always asking if I'd like more water."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Came to check this place out since I've had this style of food before. Normally when I eat at a teppan restaurant I choose rice as my base, but decided on the Beef Curry Udon and it was delicious and filling! Simple ingredients of sliced beef (tender), udon noodles, garlic butter, corn, curry powder. While sizzling, I added in the garlic shoyu and teriyaki sauce they have in bottles, and some chili powder and pepper. Mix it up and enjoy! The food stays hot and fresh the entire time so be sure to blow on it well. Noodles were very soft and fluffy and I think I like eating udon noodles like this best after getting this dish.

The servers were nice, food was delicious, and restaurant was clean. Menu is simple to order from and the food arrives very quick! I highly recommend, especially since restaurants like this are not usually in Isla Vista. Def one of the best Asian food spots in SB to check out."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,10 out of 10 would most definitely recommend cuz Jason shen's cute ass is working there and also food is good too
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Amazing food. The waiter Andy was always really attentive and provided excellent service.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,The garlic beef pepper rice is pretty good! The waiter was really nice and for IV the prices are really good. The portions are nice as well.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Haven't had a bad experience here. The food is always consistent and the service has never been lacking. I feel the same way at the Sizzling Lunch back home in San Jose. Glad quality is consistent for this franchise
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"The waitress treats customers differently and has a bad service attitude.  And they are very indifferent and ruthless towards the delivery staff, as if they were not humans but animals.  Won't go again."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"The food here is really good. I ordered the Garlic Beef pepper rice and it was definately worth it at its price point. But honestly, it was the service here that was the highlight of my meal. I think his name was Andrew Pan? But he was one of the best waiters I have ever seen. Always refilled my water and checked up on my table to see if we were okay. Nice dude. Overall, I am forsureeee coming back!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Times visited: 8

1st: 1x Garlic Pepper Beef Plate + Takoyaki
Plate is good. I recommend adding the Chili Powder and Garlic Shoyu is when mixing it to add some more flavor. Takoyaki is the soft kind (more chewy than crispy) it's decent for the price. 

2nd-3rd time: 2x Garlic Pepper Beef Plate each
Same opinion. I've been adding more chili power. Shit is good. 

4th time: 1x Calamari. 1x Cheese French Fries
Great as snacks at 9 PM while waiting for laundry. Calamari is crisp and tasty. Fries are well seasoned. Will order again

5th-10th time: They keep me coming back lol. New favorite is the Beef Rice with Curry sauce. The Asian style curry is pretty delicious, and it comes with half an egg which is pretty nice.

Honestly one of the best new restaurants in IV that opened in Fall'19. Price is reasonable (when comparing to San Francisco prices of similar foods). Food is pretty good, especially going into the colder weathers. 

I think my biggest praise is how hard the workers have been working to hone their customer service skills. 

Recommendation on 10/16/19: Do a loyalty program like stamp cards or five star! 

Will update review as time goes on."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Honestly writing this review because they give you 10% off your meal if you check in with them/write a review, but the rating itself is what I'd rate them as. Food was good, if you've ever had pepper lunch the type of food is very similar. I got the kimchi pepper beef plate thing. Would definitely say it was worth its price. 

Overall food is 3 stars but the reason I gave it 4 was because I saw another tables food come out while the customer wasn't there (restroom). This was a problem since you need to be there to cook your meat when it comes out/the plate is hot. Rather than sending it back (which would cost the owner money) or leaving it there unattended (which would result in uncooked food for the customer) The server stood there and cooked the customers food for him (while keeping it nice and organized/didn't destroy the look of it). I asked the workers, his name is Andy. Props to that guy. Good service my dude."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"tried their take-out even though a large part of the tasty experience is being able to sit down and enjoy the sizzle the food makes when it's brought to your table. but even without the sizzle, the food was pretty good and the portions are filling! the classic garlic beef pepper rice is definitely the way to go!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"Seeing hot it was a holiday, I called and verified what time they closed. Showed up well before quoted closing, walked in and was told ""we are closed."" I checked the phone number I called and it matches the Sizzling lunch's store number."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Wasn't sure what to expect about the food quality when coming in, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it! Quality was good and the sauces you add to the meal really make the flavor pop."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Highly recommend this place! IV is in a constant shortage of good Asian food and this is a step up from your average restaurant! The portions are large and the quality of the meat is great! My favorite is the garlic beef rice plate and I love that you are able to add your own amount of soy sauce/teriyaki sauce to fit your own taste. Will definitely be a returning customer!
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Love that IV now has a place like this! The food is amazing and the portions always leave me feeling super full or I even find myself bringing some to-go for later. My favorite is the Garlic Beef Pepper Rice and my boyfriend's favorite is the Curry Beef Rice with Cheese. I always add the sauces at the table (I believe one is garlic oil and one is like a sweet soy/teriyaki). Would give five stars but is a little pricey - otherwise I would come a lot more often!
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"one of my favs here in IV. coming from oc, it was really hard to find food that served as a comfort food for me. so when i found this place, it was sooooo good. a bit on the pricy but definitely worth it. if you're looking for rice plates and such check this place out"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"My new favorite restaurant in IV!! This place is so good that I come here 3 times a week! I love the garlic beef rice, make sure you add an egg and cheese with it"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"I visited Sizzling Lunch after I was trying to get some inspiration on what I wanted to have for dinner.  This is something that I've been meaning to try.  I have a similar restaurant back at home and I've never actually tried but this looked like the same concept. 

They are part of the Yelp wait list at the restaurant so the staff was already expecting me once I entered. I was warmly greeted and seated immediately.  The waitress explained the menu and she came by with an iPad and placed my order right away.  A couple minutes later I got my takoyaki and then my entrée showed up shortly after. I ended up deciding to order the noodles with the curry beef and I also got a side order of extra meat for an extra five dollars. The side order came in it's own sizzling plate so that was a surprise.  Everything was amazing. The next time I go visit, I will try to order a rice dish to see how that is like.  
What was great was that they had sauces at the table so you could add more seasoning or adjust your food accordingly.

Parking: it's always a little bit tricky here in Isla Vista but luckily I was able to find some parking a few blocks away."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Round 1: Simple yet brilliant concept in the sizzling plate of rice and beef. The corn, crispy garlic, and garlic butter works well to complement texturally and flavorfully. Really nice concept and looks great presentation wise, and to sweeten the deal, theres a limited time 25% off student discount!

Round 2: I decided to switch it up and try the garlic beef udon, and actually really liked it. Despite udon being harder to digest than rice, I felt like it was a smaller portion so I wasn't bloated by the end. I echo my previous review in that it is a great concept, the student discount is nice, and the flavors are simple yet work magically together! Service this time was not as great as my friend had to starve for a solid 30 minutes..."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,I tried the beef udon. Super good. But a little bit too oily. It is not easy to park nearby.
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Continuing my Sizzling Lunch reviews, I decided to try some new dishes:

Sweet Potato Fries: The fries are fried very crispily, moreso than other places, and then tossed in sugar. Served with ketchup, this is leaning toward a traditional french fry dish, which is interesting, but I prefer the softer sweet potato fries with sriacha aioli. 

Takoyaki: It is essentially an octopus ball topped with mayo, takoyaki sauce, and bonito flakes. Here, I think they hit a textbook takoyaki as it is gooey in the middle and cridpy on the outside, yet flavorful and not heavy.

Salmon Udon: Crossing off another one off the sizzling lunch bucket list with the Salmon Udon! Salmon here is very tricky because theres a fine line between cooking and overcooking salmon. I think the sizzling plate is too hot here and overcooks the salmon, or perhaps, I did not apply sauce fast enough. Either way, I think beef here works the best because Shabu Shabu meat is the most forgiving in terms of cook. Perhaps if the salmon were thicker, that would help it be less overcooked.

Chicken Katsu Curry: This chicken katsu rice with curry sauce did not disappoint! The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside but still tender on the inside. It came with a pretty good serving of rice topped with corn, green onion, mushrooms, and red onion. The curry sauce added a lot of flavor and paired well with the other components. Overall a very tasty and filling dish!

As a reminder, the 25% student discount is still active, so highly recommend checking out Sizzling Lunch if you're not vegetarian!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"They were very busy, but we still had a great dinner!  Staff was hustling and still managed to be polite. All three of us got different dishes and we gobbled them up - absolutely delicious! Hot, fresh, tasty plates of food that you can customize and/or season to your specific taste.  So good!!!"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Decent place for lunch and hanging out with friends.
Due to Covid-19, they have a monitor at each table that you can order everything from there, and the order will be sent straight to the kitchen. Friendly staff, fast service, great food. I love the chicken wings and sizzling rice. Plenty of options. Would love to come back again when visiting UCSB."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Went here and got the garlic beef rice with cheese and egg and it was so good. Shout out to Christine for being such a gem  love dis place!
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"The food is pretty hit or miss -- sometimes it's good, and sometimes it's not. The past two times I went, the rice was either undercooked or the dish was too salty. When the food is good I really like it, but their quality hasn't been super consistent in my opinion"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,Finally they're back open! This place is super good! I got the kimchi beef rice plate and it was tasty and the perfect amount. Happy and helpful service too! I'll be back
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"My go to restaurant when I'm looking for something filling during my gaps at school. Very nostalgic and one of the few things that remind me of the bay area.  

Service is mostly by the ipad on the table, which is great for social distancing. Sometimes extra orders on the ipad after your first order won't be seen right away, so you might as well flag a server down to assist you. 

Curry beef rice with cheese + egg: 10/10 I always order this dish because it's so filling and warms up my stomach. I love how you can leave the rice alone to get crispy at the bottom while you focus on cooking your meat. The sauces and spices on the side makes the dish taste amazing. Delicious.

Potstickers: 10/10 nice, crispy and flavorful. Your typical potsticker."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Tried this place out for the first time after it changed from being hotpot. My waiter was Andy, who recommended the beef udon with fried garlic. The beef udon was very good and the garlic recommended by Andy made it even more flavorful. This place is honestly much better than the hotpot place and is also cheaper. I will be coming back for more beef udon and more Andy ."

eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,10/10 service and food. I got the curry beef udon with egg and the quality of the food was really good. Special shoutout to our server Jason
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Omg I never understood why people were so crazy about teppanyaki (like Pepper Lunch) but now I get it. Except this place is waaaay better than Pepper Lunch.

I came with a group of 5 around 6pm on a Saturday and waited for about 10 minutes before getting seated, then got our food another 10 min after ordering. I got the standard beef udon but added cheese on top for an extra $1, and holy shit that was the best decision ever. The udon was also so buttery and the meat quality was pretty good. They give you 2 sauces at your table (forgot what they were called), so I added both and it made the udon even better bc it's not salty enough on its own. Tbh I don't even like corn and forgot to ask them to leave it out, but the whole dish was so bomb that the corn was totally fine. I literally scraped every last bit of food off the plate bc it was THAT delicious.

Btw you get 10% off for checking in on yelp + another 5% off if you pay in cash! Ahh can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in IV :3"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Very good service, especially during this pandemic. The server was very nice and attended to our needs regularly. Food was very good and worth the price."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,Terrible service. I came in and ordered at 645 and the store was a bit busy but nothing too crazy. My friend ordered RIGHT after me and then a couple ordered after him. We sit down for around 30 minutes waiting for our food and then a group of 7 came in and also ordered. My friend waiting for another 15 minutes for his food to come out (keep in mind that he was AFTER me) and then the couple got their food and then the party of 7 started to get some of their food. So I was wondering why my food hasn't came out yet and I asked and they tell me that I still have 5 orders ahead of me (which makes no sense because my friend who was BEHIND me already got his food). I worked in a restaurant before so I understand that restaurants get busy and wait times can get long but the fact that I got skipped several times over and over again and no worker came up to explain the situation makes this unacceptable. Only reason I'm not giving this place a 1 star is because they offered a free drink (which I did not take) for my inconvenience. Absolutely horrible service. The pictures below show how busy the restaurant was and when I ordered me food and when I finally received it
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"Not enough beef. Didn't taste well. Don't want to buy the same food again. I could cook much better than it.

I once also got a run after eating it"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"I've been living in this neighborhood for a couple years, but I have to say this restaurant satisfied my craving of asian food. Unlike other asian restaurants in IV, this place provides the bay area/oc atmosphere. If u want a quick asian food grab, highly recommended."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"I GOT FOOD POISONING AFTER I ATE HERE TODAY. Please save your money and go somewhere else. 

Also they play music very loudly and when I asked the server to turn it down because I had a headache he either didn't do it or barely turned it down so I ended up having to get my food to go.

I used to love coming here, but both the service and the quality of the food have gone downhill. Would not recommend unless you want food poisoning"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,negative,"Friendly service 
The food is fine (but not super )
Price is pretty affordable 
You have to find a parking space in the street ( no private parking lot)"
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"I had the kimchi beef, seemed alright by picture. It tasted pretty good for Santa Barbara asian food. My waiter was Jason and insisted I write a review if I thought the food was good. Overall not bad for a place in the middle of a college town. Definitely a must-try if alumnis are visiting UCSB since it is fairly new."
eGI_WepIIjYahIrMVRknfw,Sizzling Lunch,Japanese,positive,"Good atmosphere, all the workers are really friendly and nice.

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Sat down over a half hour, only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ..."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Not bad. Sushi roll was good but options were limited. Hibachi grill: i got steak...chef asked me 2x how i like mine-medium...Still ended up with well done. Rest of my group had chicken which all voiced lacked seasoning. 

Beware they DO NOT have a late happy hour 8-11 as advertised on their website. We asked the staff about it and they claimed 8-11 was for a different location. Their website nowhere indicates the happy hour is for a specific location nor does the website indicate they have multiple locations at all."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I'm very picky when it comes to Sushi. Quality of the fish and ingredients are very important but so is the chef, maybe the most important. Hiro San is absolutely amazing at what he does. His skills are hands down the best and he's also a really great human being to talk to. If you are in the Santa Barbara area looking for a great Sushi experience come here and sit in front of the master, you won't regret it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Even though the sushi masters are not actually Asian but they make good Sushi. The price is also cheap.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"If I based my review only on my meal, I'd have to give it one star.  But everyone else in my party of 10 enjoyed their meal, and we had a great time.  I ordered the vegetarian meal, and it was the WORST veggie meal I've ever had :(  My meal came with soup and rice, just like everyone else, but when the others got their choice of meat I got a plateful of sliced red peppers.  That's all.  Sliced red peppers.  Uh,   how about some mushrooms or zuchini or squash or about a million other veggie options.  Fortunately, I'd had enough sake bombs not to get too upset about it!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is a favorite place for me and my friends. We love sitting at the bar and indulging on half price sushi for lunch and dinner. We love their beer selection, and the place is trendy and a lot of fun. I do not like the fact that they include gratuity on the bill, and sometimes the 50 percent off seems to be closer to 47 percent... Now, since the rolls are small, one ends up spending about as much money as one would at a place with a regular price on sushi, but one ends up getting more food and a bigger variety of rolls."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"In my experience, the staff was a disappointment. We had 3 employees try to take our ""complicated"" order. We just wanted baked salmon with Avocado and cucumber. Which was just a simple customized order. While we were ordering our waitress didn't have the power to take our order. She felt it was to complicated so she just walked away and pass us up to another waitress. In result this restaurant lacks communication and mannerisms. So I wouldn't recommend this place. If your order is to complicated to them, they won't take it. they'll just pass you up to their manager."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Not worth the 50% off. I knew I had a bad feeling the second I walked in. The restaurant was a bit too hot for a sushi bar with fish sitting there behind the un-refrigerated glass all day. I should have listened to my gut but I made a huge mistake. I ended up getting so sick! Some of the worst sushi I have ever had, horrible service, and less than 1 star quality food."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This place is kinda like a Bennihana without the show.  Which was fine with me cuz i just wanted a quick lunch.  The steak, chicken, and shrimp were ok.  Theres so many places to eat around there i would probably try another place the next time im in the area.

The lunch specials are a good deal."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"They make a great show out of the cooking process right in front of you! Just make sure you don't order sushi or seat at the bar ;)
And it's not expensive, and it tastes good! I definitely am going to this place next time I visit Santa Barbara."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Though deterred by the name ""Something's Fishy"" for a restaurant that serves fish, my friend and I still chose to come to this restaurant as it appears to be the only place with tapan tables in all of Santa Barbara and we were really craving fresh fried rice. We called 24 hours in advance and made a reservation for two for the tapan tables for the next evening at 7:30 PM. Upon arriving promptly at 7:30 we were first ignored for 5 to 10 minutes at the door before finally being escorted to our table, where we were seated with two other parties, two couples, one of which was clearly expecting a third person. After waiting for a waitress to arrive to take our order for over 20 minutes, a frowning teenager finally arrived and asked if we were all ready to order. The woman that belonged to the party of three that was still waiting for their third quickly responded that no, she was not ready to order because their third friend had not arrived and the waitress promptly put away her notepad and left the table. WHAT?! Apparently because this group of strangers was not ready to order, the rest of us had to wait to eat. After the third of their party finally arrived at approximately 8PM, half an hour after our reservation time, we were finally able to order. My friend and I chose to order both tapan and sushi, and when the waitress asked if we would like our sushi roll while we were waiting for the chef we said we would. We received no sushi in the next 25 minutes while waiting for the chef to arrive, but rather the roll arrived towards the end of our meal. Overall, the chef was very nice and the food was what I expected of any adequate tapan restaurant. After finishing our meal, we had to beg the waitress several times to finally deliver our check, at this point it was around 9:30PM, we had been at the restaurant for two hours, and were completely exhausted. When she finally delivered it, we were displeased to see that she had charged us full price for our sushi, despite the restaurant's advertisement for half-off sushi during the time we were there.

I will probably return here, but only because it is the only establishment in the entire city with tapan tables. The service is horrible."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I heard of this place and meant to try it for a long time, but was too poor to go. But then I heard they have half-price (select) sushi on weekdays! So of course we had to go try it out. 

The only thing I'd complain about is that the wait for the sushi bar is really long. You can't sit at the Teppan Yaki tables if you're only getting sushi and the sushi bar seats only a couple of people. 

The sushi was pretty good, although some rolls could have been made better. They were obviously in a rush since they had so many customers and so the service wasn't that great. But for $19 (not including tax + gratuity) we got 4 rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri. Overall pretty good for my sushi cravings when I'm on a tight budget."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"My first day off in a while took me on a day trip to Santa Barbara and a lunch at this place.  My friend and I got a recommendation for this place because of its half price Sushi Monday-Thursday.  I always get a little nervous when I hear about deals on sushi but we decided to try it out and boy am I glad we did.  Not only was the sushi a great price but it tasted really good, we got to sit and watch the chef prepare all of our food which always makes me comfortable with what I am eating but also makes me want to make my own sushi since it looks pretty easy.  Was this sushi absolutely amazing? No but it was worth paying $ 13 for 3 rolls and very enjoyable."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....

We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. 

We ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, ""do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!"" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, ""I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!"" (very politely) He then came back with ""ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind"" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it's hard to always please everyone. But it's unacceptable to be rude to people!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"There's nothing really special about this place. My boyfriend and I decided to try it out despite the negative reviews. I understand what some of the 1 star reviews were for. Our waitress was nice but seemed like she didn't want to be there and she had a friend there visiting her and she was chatting with her and forgot that we had ordered saké. The food was okay. Nothing really bad about it, just not a place I would go back to"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,The best Japanese restaurant! Stumbled upon this with my family and gave it a try... Dinner and a show! I saw tricks I haven't seen in any Japanese restaurant before! And every single food dish was phenomenal. If only I lived in SB! I'd be here every night!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Something's Fishy was an overall excellent restaurant. I ordered the Hibachi Steak, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal along with the performance from my chef while he cooked it! This was a semi-formal restaurant, as they have dim lighting with a fairly expensive hibachi menu. The sushi however is always half-off and was extremely good. The crunchy roll was one of the best I've ever had. Beyond the food itself, the service was pretty good. Our waitress failed to notice us for awhile, and in return brought out two plates of edamame on the house to apologize. From there on it was great service. The presentation of the food was incredible. They cook your food right in front of you and even give you a show along with fairly large portion sizes that coincide with the expensive pricing of the hibachi meals. If you go here, the price greatly depends on what you order. If you go for hibachi it will be expensive, and if you go for sushi it will be a cheap comparatively to other sushi restaurants. I loved this restaurant and would highly recommend that anyone tries it! It's very welcoming to dates, large groups, and even birthday or celebration dinners."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,One of my all time favorite place to go with a group.  I don't care for the show and the atmosphere but the teppanyaki style is delicious.  They have the BEST dipping sauces for the meat and veggies!  I wouldn't recommend this place as a great place for Japanese food nor for sushi but I do give it props for their grilled items.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This place was alright in my opinion, but not anything close to the best sushi I've ever had. The PCH roll was somewhat dry, and while the tuna sashimi and Caterpillar roll were pretty decent I've still tasted better. Ironically, the most disappointing part of the meal was the tea that my parents and I ordered. It tasted like water; absolutely no flavor whatsoever. As my dad said, ""This green tea tastes like water, and not even good water!"" Although the prices are cheaper, I'll probably hit up Arigato next time I'm in the mood for sushi just for the better quality."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Well, to start the dining area is very very dark. We sat at the sushi bar and our table was dirty and sticky. Next we ordered. I got a spicy tuna hand roll and as I look over to the chef who is making our sushi, I see him scooping the spicy tuna with his bare hands and packing it into the seaweed wrap. Then I see him walk over to the microwave oven, touch that with his bare hands, touch dirty menus with his bare hands, and then go back to my spicy tuna roll and continue to scoop it and pack it with his bare hands ! I couldn't eat it after it was served to me. Since I was starving ordered another roll and ate that, but BAD IDEA. I immediately became dizzy and nauseous. I drank lots of water and decided that maybe I could walk it off. We left and continued to walk around downtown santa barbara and no longer than 20 minutes after we left my stomach started to grumble and I felt faint. After running around frantically looking for a restroom I finally found one and puked up all the sushi that I ate. I would not reccomend eating here until it is inspected.."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The miso soup is salty and wrong. All the cooked meats are a catastrophe (burnt, chewy, nasty etc). The always half-price sushi is stupid. 

You're going to get full on rice.
The fish itself isn't what I'd call amazing, but it definitely isn't bad. The malibu is pretty satisfying too."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Ok food, poor service.

I had dinner here on a Tuesday by myself. I was seated quickly at the sushi bar. I ordered 1 specialty roll and 2 standard rolls. The Mexican roll was excellent. Really, really good! The other 2 were not, and I only ate 1 piece of each. My tempura roll has no tempura, but the real problem was the seaweed wrappers were so strong and overbearing I could not enjoy the flavor of the fish.  I later realized there was a board of specials and wishes I had ordered off of it. They had some rolls that sounded wonderful.

A bigger issue for me was the service. I was never given water. I was asked to move to make soave for a larger group (this is fine, happy to do it) and while I didn't mind at all, I was never given a dish for my soy sauce in my new seat. I ended up using the serving tray. These are minor inconveniences but could have been resolved if someone had checked in even once to see what I needed. I didn't even have the option to order more food if I had wanted it.

I left hungry and disappointed."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The pricing is great, and the sushi is alright. Unless you buy the expensive rolls, the sushi is just alright. Since it is so cheap, it is worth it. Nice employees and cooks"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Fantastic service and good sushi at great prices (Half off rolls Mon-Thur and 2 for 1 sake). We sat up at the counter and the sushi chefs were friendly and very attentive even though we also had a regular server. My husband and I were taking a trip down memory lane--he had gone to college in Santa Barbara ten years ago and Something's Fishy was his favorite happy hour spot way back when. The fact that the food was up to par with his memory was a huge bonus. Ten years of consistently good food and pricing is a rare accomplishment!!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Affordable sushi with amazing taste! If your in the Santa Barbara downtown area, this is the perfect place to stop in with an excellent sushi bar menu offering."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Went on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  We were greeted quickly and took a seat at the sushi bar.  We enjoyed the spicy tuna rolls, crab rolls and a crunchy roll.  Each was exceptionally tasty and well worth it.   We spent about $24 for the whole meal and were very pleased.  In my opinion, the reviews so far have made this place under-rated.  Go enjoy!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I'm not a big sushi fan, but I do like unagi.  But the reason I go here is the Benihana-style steak and shrimp meal during the early hour dinner.  For less than $20, you can get the meal, which is 4 stars, a cut below Benihana, but it's about a third the price.  The miso soup is 5 stars and their salad dressing is zesty.  Due to its reasonable prices, I'd rate it a healthy 4 star."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This place is really fun. The pricing isn't too high if you're looking for an affordable dining experience in Santa Barbara. All of the staff are extremely friendly and the service is great. Sushi is always good. The hibachi is also a safe bet. Definitely recommend.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"The sushi is great. My personal favorite is the crunchy roll, it never disappoints. I would come here again because the food is good, but it does not get 5 stars due to the lack of quality service. My drink hardly ever gets refilled. I've learned to only order water, as the soda from the soda machine is never good- it either tastes very watered down or like liquid floor cleaner. One of the managers, a woman, is particularly rude. Luckily you don't really interact with her. Wait times can be long if you have a large party, but the good food is worth it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Love this place. The price is right, the food is good and the tables are all set up for saki bombs! The waitresses are on point and chefs talented in showmanship and presentation. I recommend you make reservations and make a night of it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"The service is efficient. The sushi size is larger than Sushi Teri - the most prevalent sushi place in the area - the prices are average on Fri - Sun but Mon - Thu sushi is half-price! They're quick for a call in order, a little slower it seems for in restaurant orders. The place can be pleasant if it is a weekday but it can get very crowded on the weekends. Most employees are efficient and on the nice side, but not overwhelmingly so."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,I don't really like this place..I needed to find a place to fix my blood sugar with my boyfriend at the time.. and came across a Japanese restaurant in Santa Barbara..it felt like a sauna and I felt like I was at Bally's..ill totally gross..food not that great..and service slow..but Santa Barbara is a great place to shop and unwind..
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Good lunch menu and sushi is half of during lunch. 
The fish is tasty too. Can't complain. I was fortunate to have picked them. To have lunch."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,It is very cool experience and the food is great I definitely recommend it and would gladly come back
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Half price sushi was probably one of my favorite things to dine on when working downtown..in love with spice tuna, for some reason theirs never really did much for my taste buds, nevertheless the food is good whether your sitting at the sushi bar or doing it up getting a steak and fried rice at the group tables. Manager is friendly, staff is attentive. Just busy as hell on certain nights, but worth the wait."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Don't believe the bad reviews. Everything was delicious. Went with my Groupon and now I'm stuffed as heck. Highly recommend either the shrimp or scallops. Certainly pricey but you get a ton of tasty food. Also you should upgrade to the fried rice.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Went to celebrate a birthday with my family and had a great time.. we went in time for the early bird specials which are a very good deal especially for the large amount of food served us. I ordered the Steak & Shrimp . The steak was flavorful and the shrimp were fresh and tasty. Our server was very good, promptly refilled drinks and pre-bussed all plates before next entree. I was surprised the entire restaurant was full on a Tuesday early evening, just another sign they are doing a great job ."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Great stop for a quick get together. Inexpensive and good time with friends, yes. High quality sushi, no. I do not go for the atmosphere. I go for happy hour. 2 for 1 sake & half price sushi, or just takeout for half price sushi. I get the spicy tuna and PCH roll. I have never had a real problem with waiting, been lucky with this because I know there can be 45 minute waits sometimes. I find 4-6 there is no to little wait on the days I have gone.

I repeat, they are not the best place for sushi, but I am always happy with these two rolls. I sometimes get avocado with the tuna. For the price, I can't beat it. 

I do find they are inconsistent with seating. I was allowed, with a group of friends, to sit at the hibachi tables for sushi, drinking our sake while waiting for a table because the bar was full. They then just served us there instead of moving us. Other times with different hosts we were not allowed to preorder our sake and sip while waiting, not allowed to use the hibachi empty tables."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Este sitio para mí es el mejor restaurante japonés de Santa barbara, tienen una promoción todos los días a mitad de precios algunos rolls. También él servicio es bastante bueno, y los Rolls también. También tienen una zona a parte donde tienes a tu chef personal y puedes pedir arroz, vegetales,camarones,etc y el chef te los cocina en una plancha enfrente tuyo."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Usually I do not post reviews.  But this experience was just too bad. 

We came to Santa Barbara for vacation. Kids love Japanese food and this is why I chose this restaurant.  Waiter was very nice but food and service by the chef was terrible.  He rushed cooking everything, not pleasant at all.  We ordered Fillet, Scallops, shrimps and Chicken.  But everything just taste the same, SALTY!  Even my kids says it the worse teppanyaki she has ever had.  The chef was very rude and pushed entire soy sauce plate to my daughter's cloth without a ""sorry""....  Terrible place, will not go again!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Our family took a friend out for sushi. Wait time was not too bad, sushi was delicious.. the only bad experience was the server came my 18 month a water glass and when he spilled it immediately like most small kids would do he made a rude comment. We clearly asked for a part of the check to be on a separate bill. The sushi chef had to resolve the problem which was ridiculous. I'm disappointed in my experience."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Food and service is good. The chef, Sergio, great guy and had bright future of him. Hope to see him next time as the head chef!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Our poorly trained waiter.  How could they have put him on the floor? It was sad. He was clueless. The food was boring and tasteless. The first time we went we sat at the sushi bar and it was okay (2 stars). This last time our party of four sat at the hibachi table and it was pretty terrible even though we ordered sushi and off the grill. It just isn't worth the money. Their is no ambience, service, or personality here. It's like a burnt out chain restaurant filled with zombies."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I get sick here almost every time so it's unfortunate that everyone wants to have their birthdays here. It's dirty and the service is unfriendly. I used to really like their half off sushi deals, but I'm not sure it's worth it in the end. They also cant split checks because of their out of date computers. So with a party of 12, with say 8 credit cards and one credit card machine for the whole restaurant your pretty much looking at an hour or so to pay the bill and leave."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,A friend of mine and I had dinner few nights ago and was really impressed.. we ordered quite a bit & everything we tried was fantastic .. must try if you're looking for me Benihana style restaurant in Santa Barbara
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"So im at somethings fishy right now. My son and i just walked in to order to go.....the ""manager"" states we cannot order to go due to a sushi guy training and one other sushi chef there. So i say can we just order our food to go when we are called, due to their being a list.....and she said no! Now i sayed its the same thing....and a win situatiin since they will not have our seats occupied......i asked for the main manager and she said they would come, instead a waiter came to sit us down.......FML"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Love 1/2 off sushi during the week, and the rolls are pretty tasty! Comfort food at an affordable price for sure."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Sushi was good! Therefore two stars. But then I order the meal for my kids with the steak and shrimp, it was horrible undercooked rice and the salad was old you can tell because the lettuce was turning brown around the edges I didn't touch it. The portions are super small the veggies that I couldn't change for some odd reason tasted like dirt literally. The steak was bad just unseasoned really bad! I order a glass of wine and they brought me 8 day old wine that tasted like vinegar horrible! Over all the waiter was not attentive at all, the food was really bad! What a waist of 76 dollars never ever again!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"The sushi was pretty good, but just not the best that I've ever had. However, the food cooked on the hibachi grill was amazing. Our chef put on a great show, was very humorous, and made sure to engage us in the experience. If you want a dinner and a show, this would be a great option. Great food and a great staff."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Here's the deal.  It was a day before Father's day, a Saturday. We were driving back from San Francisco. Sat at the bar with my husband, son, daughter.  I was feeling sick so we ordered mostly sushi for my husband and son.  The bill was $92.00. When I was paying the bill, the manager says, next time you should ask for the Friday and Saturday EAT ALL U CAN SUSHI and ROLLS. Now you tell me I thought.  If he had excellent customer service skills, he would a. Tell us about the SPECIALS; b. He would give me the price for the specials $22 per person even if we didnt EAT ALL WE CAN SUSHI.  Simple courtesy and sincere customer service skills are hard to come by these days; it's all about MONEY and PROFIT.  I even bought a gift card for a friend before I was given the bill. And the manager didn't care to let us know or give us credit for a special we could've taken advantaged of. Am I asking for too much?      Freya N."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Visited this place while at a weekend in SB. I thought it would be comparable to Benihana and my friend recommended it.
However, everything was mediocre. The food wasn't bad but nothing really made me say woah. 
The sushi was better than the actual hibachi style entrees."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This place is all about the HALF-OFF Sushi. Can't beat this sushi place ... mon-thursday. I used to come here once a week. But now like once a month since I've been working way more than usual in the later hours, but definitely an SB favorite. If you haven't tried it, check it out. The Hibachi grill is fun here too, but not younger crowd oriented to come get wasted and sake bomb."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The waitress serving us was so rude when we asked to have our hibachi order to be low sodium. We explained to the waitress how other hibachi grills just give our food before they add the  extra sodium for everyone else. The waitress began to cut us off when we were talking and left us high and dry in the middle of our conversation to get the manager. We decided to leave at this point and went to the front where the manager was to pay for our drinks. One of the people in my party told the manager they never drank their drink. The manager who was equally rude gave us an attitude as we were signing our receipt for all drinks and said what do you expect us to do give it to someone else? We never implied they should give it to another. We were just unsatisfied with the surface and didn't drink anything and wanted to leave. Usually managers calm such situations instead of adding more fuel to the fire. Way to go! Yet another bad review that has been added to the many many many other bad reviews you guys have! 

Ps we decided to overlook the bad reviews when we chose to dine at this restaurant. But, we should have listened to advice the other helpers said."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Here's the thing about this Japanese Steakhouse and sushi Bar.... 

I WANTED to like it, but I also wanted sushi... and when an establishment says sushi bar, I expect a LITTLE more then your run of the mill California rolls.  There was one sushi option on the dinner menu and that's it.  

While the food was good, I would have rather them just said japanese steak house, and been pleasantly surprised to find some traces of sushi... 

Sorry guys, the name is decieving..."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Choose your meat, a beer, and sit back back and enjoy the show! The food is great and the atmosphere classy (but not too classy). This place is great for groups: but it's hard to get a seat, so make a reservation.

They also have a full sushi bar, which I've sat down at, but based on the rest of the food, I would guess it's pretty good."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Always enjoyable to sit at the Teppan for dinner. Good steaks and salmon is excellent.  Not the greatest sushi, but we come for the chef's performance at the grill."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,You can hear the twang of a gunji playing while vibrant cherry blossoms dance through the spring wind in each scrumptious bite of sushi. The ice cold green tea mochi leaves you refreshed at the end of your feast that would have any master samurai loosen their tightly gripped katana sword...if only for a moment.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The first time I came here I had just turned 18. I was literally a culinary dunce. The only thing I knew was hometown Mexican and Vietnamese food. 

I made the chef cook my salmon sashimi which apparently was suppose to be eaten raw. At the time I didn't know. The chef was so nice and accommodating. 

Now, I've been to the best sushi restaurant in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Bangkok, Los Angeles, and Miami. This place does not hold up. 

On a side note, a fellow Yelper thought it would be appropriate to send me a hateful message about how dumb I was. I guess he was born with sushi in hand.

Cheers!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"We arrived with a party of four hoping to all sit together & eat some half off sushi. They told us the wait would be around 30 minutes so we grabbed some sake & sat down to wait.
Over an hour later we were still waiting to be seated, but at least it gave us an hour to experience the unfriendly staff.
We ended up leaving & going across the street to SB brewing co, which sat us immediately without a problem!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This is my favorite sushi place to go to in Santa Barbara. I love sitting at the sushi bar. I have not had the hibachi yet but hopefully I will one day. Delicious food.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We stumbled upon this place on or way back to the car and to not take forever to decide where to eat we just decided here. When they were sitting us I checked the ratings and i don't know why it has 3 stars. Got a little scared but we tried the hibachi, and it was good. My favorite was the shrimp. Really good flavor. Least favorite was the chicken. I also didn't like that they didn't have noddles. But the service was nice and our cook was too. We tried the sushi sampler: it wasn't the great. The place could look neater and cleaner feel."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This place is bomb!! And classy as well lol. Sucks they don't have one in goleta!! I would definitely go waaay more if they did. Love their rolls. My faves r Philadelphia and Mexican sooo bomb!!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. The food is always delicious and well priced. I love the sushi, but the hibachi grill is definitely the best part! The servers are super friendly, the chefs are entertaining.. I've never had a bad experience here. They always seat you as soon as possible and I'm always looking forward to coming back!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Food was actually really good. Sushi was creamy and the rice was cooked very well. 

The two missing stars were for the lousy service. Water had to be begged out of a none attentive waiter. The chefs didn't acknowledge any customer and looked like they would rather be bowling.

Prices made it worthwhile."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Amazing service, great food, fantastic hibachi showmanship.  The chef we had was  super friendly and gave us large portions of high quality food.  The vegetarian dish was great as was the filet mignon and scallops."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The food was your average hibachi grill experience ...the sauces were not that good as they were all similar with a taste of vinegar.  I would prefer a sweet, salty, and vinegar for a variety.  The best part was we got there before 6:00 for the early bird prices.  Chicken and shrimp was about 18.95 where steak and shrimp was 20.95... It was more after 6:00.  The sushi we got to go but the sushi bar was full with many choices.  My husband wanted Bud Light but the had a few types unknown to us so he declined.  Our chef cooked and left where the guy next to us put on a show."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We called for a reservation for 10 people.  Arrived on time and were seated promptly.  Cold beer and good service overall.  Server was a bit inexperienced but he made do the best he could.  He kept us entertained and moved on past minor errors... Sushi was very good and meals were very filling.  It was difficult to serve the 10 of us, but they did very well.  Prices were reasonable.  The restaurant could use a deep clean... many of the other restaurants in the area appeared to have higher cleanliness standards.  It was fine for what it was."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,What a turn around in just a couple of weeks. I have to say I was skeptical about going in after my last visit. But I am a local that likes sushi when all the other places are closed. I enjoy talking with hiro. The sushi chef. Funny a great guy. Service was excellent and enjoyable. I know sometimes the bosses don't know what happens when they're not there. So yelps a good way telling them there experience. Looking forward in continue business with something's fishy.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I've been eating at Something's Fishy for a couple of years now and although I'm not a ""Sushi Expert"" I know that when you factor in cost, quality and quantity, Something's Fishy is the best sushi in Santa Barbara.

Yesterday my friend and I decided to take advantage of their ""1/2 price rolls"" deal and boy was it good! I had The Philadelphia, The Santa Barbara, Tempura Shrimp and California Rolls and my friends and I also ordered the ""Crispy Rolls"" which weren't on the menu, to split.

Quick Tip: Crispy Rolls. Enough said.

The service at the sushi bar was great and we had a lot of fun talking and taking our time. The food was more than filling and tasted so fresh. One really learns how bod sushi buffets are when you have fresh sushi for the first time in a long while.

The waitress was always on top of things refilling our drinks and splitting the checks for all 5 of us. Another great aspect about this place is it's location. With the reasonably priced (for Santa Barbara) parking lot right behind it we were able to leave our cars and just walk up and down State St. to work the food off.

I would highly recommend Something's Fishy and just one more time let me say: Crispy Rolls. Period."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Well, let me begin with saying this has been my boyfriend and mines go to dinner spot for over 2 years. We do like the food, he loves the hibachi steak and shrimp and I love the half-price sushi. They also have great fried rice. The food is not what I have to complain about. Though it is not the best sushi, it is great for the price. Sadly, this place has just been going down hill. We frequent it often, but I am ready to stop giving them my business. For the price of hibachi, we want better service. There is something going on since it seems every time we go there are completely new waiters. Maybe bad management, I'm not sure. But the service here is plain out starting to suck."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"yours truly is the old weekend manager for this wonderful establishment... although its been a while since i've been there, there is no doubt in my mind that the menu is exactly the same...

so what can i say about this place, if you want to have fun and get drunk, eat a good meal, and see some cool tricks, then this place is for you...if your on your first date or about to hit up a club, probably not a good idea as you will reak of cooked food for the rest of the night...

definite things i would recommend:  Filet and shrimp with the famous fried rice (their secret is that they steam it in butter and chicken broth) and from the sushi bar, i would recommend the house somethings fishy roll... a good combination of fresh seafood and fried tempura"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Sally Spork reviews Something's Fishy Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi Bar

Atmosphere: Well this spot has been in SB forevaa. Very large restaurant large square tables with a man throwing knifes in the air and slicing and dicing over a skiddle so hot it spontaneously bursts into flame (how anyone walks away with their eyebrows is a wonder!) We ate at the sushi bar, packed on a Tuesday night like birds on a wire. 

Service: We were quickly seated, and asked to be at the bar. We were not greeted by the men behind the sushi bar, even when we tried to make a simple chit-chat over the sushi (I praised the presentation), there was no return. While the chefs don't have to entertain, I do enjoy when they are present and attentive, which is not the case at this establishment. These guys are dishing out volume of sushi, so this is to be expected.  

Food/drink: The sushi was good. We ate an assortment of rolls that are discounted at a happy hour of sorts. Yellow tail, eel, crab.. it was all tasty. We had a seaweed salad which was mushy as if it had been  soaking in the dressing too long.  

Summary: Something's Fishy is the Disneyland of sushi. And some locals and tourists alike will find this place entertaining. Would I go back? Probably not. I prefer the smaller, 'hole in the wall' types of sushi places and there are several to choose from in SB."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I am a native Santa Barbarian and I've been going to this place for 10+ years.  Rarely have I ever had a bad experience and I always recommend Something's Fishy to folks from out of town who want a fun experience.  Not only is their sushi the best price in town (half off, all the time) but their hibachi is to die for!  Always, always, always get the fried rice!  My family is completely spoiled because their fried rice is so good.  It doesn't taste as good anywhere else.  Nearly every single hibachi chef I have had does a great job with entertaining, although every now and then (typically during the lunch hour) I have had a chef who is new/learning, so he didn't do as many tricks.  Every now and then a chef will come up with something completely different that I've never seen before, and that's always a treat!

I have had their halibut, chicken, shrimp, and steak and all of it is good.  You can't go wrong.  The best deal you can get is their deluxe filet mignon dinner which comes with miso soup, salad with an amazing ginger dressing, fried rice, grilled vegetables, and mochi ice cream for dessert.  The filet mignon simply melts in your mouth.  Exquisite.

Save room for dessert because their fried green tea ice cream is without a doubt one of my favorite desserts of all time.  You get the fried tempura outside that is warm and crunchy with the refreshing green tea ice cream center... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This place is definitely worth your time, but it does get busy during dinner, especially on the weekends.  So if you have a large group, I would highly recommend calling and making a reservation.  They also have an early bird special with discounts off their hibachi, as long as you get there and order between the hours of 3:00-6:00 PM."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We were in Santa Barbara yesterday for an event at the Fess Parker. We decided to get something to eat before driving back and we stumbled upon this Hibachi Steakhouse. We looked at the other reviews and decided to give it a try and we are delighted that we did. We were immediately greeted the moment we walked in and seated right away. We got our menus and drinks within a couple of minutes fantastic food and service, which was quite surprising based on the previous reviews of wait times and horrible service. This will be a regular spot for us. Really was impressed with one of the managers, Yukari for being on top of everything."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Following the whole Hibachi/Benihana idea, Something's Fishy is a place I've been to many a time when coming home to SB. Its somehow got a little homey attachment to it for me, but after eating here quite a few times you realize that without the whole SHOW and food Dance, the food is ""Meh, ok"" at best. 

Getting any hibachi dish will taste essentially the same, because they use about 2 spices for everything, while fancifully grilling it on a Hibachi stove. This place isn't somewhere to go for good food. 
Instead go for the action of the chefs, the volcano onions, and all other Kitschy disneyfied food creation.
Add in some Sake Bombing, and it makes the whole experience much more fun! If you've got kids, take them here they'll love the show that puts your food, literally, on fire! My friend recalled that in his childhood he thought these kinds of chefs were ""the best in the world,"" go here and maybe your child will think so too.

If you haven't got kids, then knock back a few sake bombs and let the fresh food with a fire-y pizazz put you in a daze, while you munch on the fire's creations. 

Note: this place's prices have gone up quite steeply over the years, and probably will go up again. As of now, its pushing the limits of value for quality/food/entertainment, but I wouldn't go if it gets any more expensive."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Delicious sushi with a great atmosphere. Located right off State St. this place is easy to find and always satisfies. Great for groups or a date for two seated at the bar.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Had it for dinner with a group of friends. Food is overpriced definitely for the Benihana-styled cooked food. It's entertaining to watch the chefs cook your food in front of you, but my steak was overcooked and really dry. The rest of the food was not that great. Service was also slow. 

The only reason we gave two stars is for the half priced sushi days, but even then it's only mediocre. The service for that was prompt, but the fish in the rolls are puny. It's filling for something cheap."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"A great show at the teppanyaki tables, and a nice long sushi bar. The sushi is average at best, but definitely hits the spot, and it's cheap and thus plentiful. Monday-Thursday most sushi is half-price, and you can't beat that for stuffing yourself!

The waiting staff is helpful, but they are sometimes difficult to get ahold of. Get drink refills when you can."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The waitress and wait staff was very friendly and helpful. But I would definitely not recommend the hibachi grill or sushi. The rice and everything was full of butter that it changed the color of the rice. The sushi that was raw was good, but than again when it came to baked rolls, they dropped the ball again. The vegetables lacked seasoning, as did the rice, if you ignore the mountain of cholesterol they call butter."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I would only go during happy hour when the rolls are half off. Even still, I've had cheaper and better sushi elsewhere."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"First time in Santa Barbara during Fiesta and apart from the festival and the confetti-filled eggs, dining at Hibachi was the highlight of my trip.

The food was amazing! The staff was great! Our chef Francisco was the star of the show! Oh and did I mention that the food was amazing?!

I highly recommend this place, whether it's for the sake bombs, hibachi, sushi, or sake bombs (yes, I know I have ""sake bombs"" twice but that's because of the amount of sake bombs I had that night) I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I have only come here for the sushi and for half-off sushi this is a great spot. It loses stars for its inconsistent sushi rolls. I usually like the Tomsan roll which is a yummy eel roll with other ingredients but occasionally there is hardly a piece of eel in it. However, it's half off - so I really cannot complain. The service is outstanding and the sushi chefs are great people. 

I would recommend this spot more for lunch considering dinnertime brings forth the louder and more annoying crowd. It is also filled with birthdays and this restaurant's birthday song is horrid to the ears - the tambourine needs to be destroyed! 

If you want fast, cheap sushi then this is the place for you - you will find me here often during the day!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Food is great. Fresh sushi.  It is a bit noisy here because of the little show before they cook the steak but it's okay. The service is great and fast too.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"note: This review is based almost entirely on the lunch special which is usually the only times I go here.

Half priced sushi for lunch? Spending just over $10 per person and getting full on purely sushi? Hells yes. Ignore the sushi-snobs, they'll drop a star or two just because the wrap wasn't perfectly tucked-in or the rice was slightly not the way they like it. It's not the best sushi in the world, or even Santa Barbara, but it's pretty tasty and for lunch prices a steal.

Only had dinner here once with a group. Was drunk so can't comment on the food accurately but I liked it and had a pretty good time. A bit pricier in the evenings though, especially with the benihana-live grill-thing."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Such good sushi for low prices!! BUT they should really update the online hours. I walked over excited to get my rolls and the guy in the front rudely said ""CLOSED"" as I opened the door. Then said ""9:30 is the summer hours and it's not changing!"" Idk who the guy was. Never seen him before and I've come there quite often with my boyfriend..
Could've been a bit nicer. But food is great."

Last time we came here was a NIGHTMARE
- told to wait 30 mins for table
-50 mins later and multiple times checking in to see if we can get seated (empty tables everywhere)
We were seated by the manager
- told we had to wait for the other party of 2 to show up... another 20 mins...
1 hour 40 mins later... we order...
- we get our water 10 mins later and salad 20 mins later 2hours and 10 mins later....we get our food order taken....the CHEF DOES NOT SHOW UP FOR 50 minutes ------- at this point the other party literally leaves- the manager runs after them( as we catch a waiter to ask where our chef is?!?!)

They bring us deep fried crap as a sorry and fresh nice fish to the people who ran out......are you freaking kidding me? (Also we don't eat fried food)

The couple was much older... so wE believe they also judged us by age..

Our chef arrives and does not verify our orders, doesn't say hello or smile.... he seemed exhausted... 

My salmon hibachi was raw and gummy and gross!!!

Steak was good

The kicker!! They attempted to over charge us- when we had already paid!! Said we had to pay more!! I almost wanted to throw their fried tempura at them. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. 

Also we had at least 5 different people come to refill our waters EVERY 2 minutes!!! What is going on in this place?? Management is TERRIBLE!!!

(Brought our local friends here since they had changed from something's fishy- they were so traumatized- said will never be back!) 

The older couple sitting at our table were in a date (we were on a double date with our friends) I felt so bad for them as this older couple was clearly tourists! Shame on you - embarrassment of a business."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"No AYCE. They offer 1/2 priced sushi, which works out to be about the same price as AYCE.  Decent quality, small selection of rolls. Nothing covered in heavy mayo sauce.  Not the best waiter service.  They also offer hibachi tables, but we ate at the bar."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"OK, If you're in SB and you want to have sushi with a big group around a chef grill and do Saki bombs (where you put a shot of hot saki on chop sticks over a glass of Soporo and yell bonzi and you pound the table making the saki drop into the beer and then chug) this is the place to go. You can laugh, get loud and eat great sushi till you drop. I have had so many good times in this place over the years, it's rediculous! Do it!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"At the front of restaurant, they placed a huge sign: ""post a photo on Yelp and you'll get $5 off"", but when you get the checks and ask for the $5 off, a photo is not sufficient.  They want to read my review.   No Thanks.  I will NOT write a good review to get $5 off.  I'm sorry , your restaurant's sushi  doesn't deserve a good review. The customer service was good, but the sushi  and rolls was tasteless.  Fish was not fresh.  It has no taste.  The rolls are mostly rice.  To make matters worst, they were skimpy on the fillings and the sauce.  Their most expensive roll ($18), which I was looking forward to try, was so bland, all I tasted was soy sauce.  I literally felt I ate a $18 bowl of white rice with soy sauce!!!  The only tasty item was their Eel sushi which was, unfortunately, ruined by long pieces of fine bones.  I'm no expert in sushi, but I have tasted better sushi in supermarket and small establishments.  Don't call yourself a sushi bar until you perfected your food.  Cost was not a factor, cuz I was expecting to pay more at tourist spots.  However, one of the worst thing you can do to a customer is charging more for inferior products."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,The quality of the sushi is terrible along with the old soggy ginger. Asked for a crunchy roll and got an avocado roll with minimal crunches on top. Seems like every year the quality of this restaurant is downgrading. They seem complacent and don't care much about a customer's happiness. I recommend Kai sushi further down on state street. Way better service and quality of sushi.

Two thumbs up, love to visit again."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,Wow. What can I say about the manager that doesn't want to help her guest when they need food. I was a regular customer trying to get food for my short lunch. I always call ahead other places to ensure I can have food ready to eat when I get there. The woman manager said she couldn't do that. They couldn't prepare food unless I had take out. Which made no sense to me.  When I got there she stated she didn't want people to get use to doing that. Which means to me. She doesn't want people to get use to ordering food and enjoying there meal. She had the worst attitude and I told her that she had the worst customer service I've ever seen. Like I said before. I was a regular customer. But not anymore. I work with customers and this isn't how you get repeat business. It's up to you if you want to eat there. But never again for me.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Every single time I walk into this restaurant, I always get the best service and every single time I leave, I walk out very satisfied!! Sunday-Thursday, they have a killer deal at 1/2 off sushi rolls for a majority of their rolls. My favorite roll is the MEXICAN ROLL (cooked salmon on top, avocado, jalapeño, tempura, crab....). If you haven't tried it, it's a definite must with their delicious spicy mayo sauce! As for the teppanyaki, I'm addicted to the fried rice and shrimp and salmon that the best chef- Carlos makes!! Carlos is very fun to sake bomb with and also makes a delicious ""Malibu"" plate! Ask for Carlos as your chef, and Emma or Masami as your server and I guarantee you'll have a great experience with a fun cook/server!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Stop by here on our way home from Santa Ynez. Wasn't bad at all. I had the salmon hibachi. It was a lot of food. It included, soup, salad, fried rice, sauteed veggies, and shrimp. By the time I got to the salmon, I was already full. The salmon was seasoned and cooked very well. I was impressed. 

Parking was a pain. Service was decent."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I recently went down to Santa Barbara for my cousin's wedding.  That was awesome.  Our first meal however, was not awesome.  We got down there around 9ish and I asked the bellman at my brother's hotel where we could get some good sushi.  The first thing out of his mouth was ""OH! Something's Fishy is just a few blocks away.""  Now this could have, and should have, been interpreted differently.  I took it at first as a gut instinct to associate his idea of good sushi with my idea of good sushi.  Not to act all snobbish about raw fish, but his idea of good sushi turned out to be rolls which were mediocre at best (more than 2/3's were deep fried in one way or another) and a minimal Nigiri list.  By minimal I am referring to old, dry octopus and hot pink tuna.  The service was slow and pretty much every bite I had made me angrier at myself for having listened to this guy's recommendation.  (I should have taken it as a sign that not one of the chefs was Japanese)  I seriously don't know how people can give this restaurant 4 or 5 stars unless they have never had sushi, ever, and never had any real clue as to what sushi should look or taste like.  I am sorry Something's Fishy, but you stink."

I took my girlfriend the other evening and the experience was delightful and romantic. They also did wonderfully to cater to her allergies. All in all, if you're ok paying 25 to 30-ish bucks a person for a full meal, Something's Fishy is a great place to go"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Went here for dinner tonight with my boyfriend. We sat at the sushi bar and ordered 3 nigiris and a dinner box. The sushi chef was beyond rude.. and when I reminded him about our order (which he had forgotten about) he rolled his eyes and gave us a really bad fishy tuna. THEN.. we drove home and literally 15 minutes later we both got sick. REALLY SICK. This was a horrible experience. We are both SB locals and are always open to trying new places. Unfortunately, I will NEVER return to this place. It definitely DOES NOT deserve a place on State St. I hope no one else gets as sick as we did."

And on my way to the bathroom I got a glimpse of the kitchen and the floor was filthy. At 12:30pm? That made me nervous.

Its good for a cheap dinner, but only at the 1/2 price."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Took my fiancé here for his birthday for a fun hibachi dinner, but was nervous since since there were so many mixed reviews about the place. Overall, it was a good experience. 

Our hibachi chef was nice, but wasn't very engaging and didn't give us a show, but the food was good. It seemed like 1/3 of the chefs did the whole entertainment side of hibachi while the rest just cooked in front of you. That was the most disappointing. 

Good food, but have had better at other places. Nice chef and waitress, but missed out on the ""show"" part of hibachi. If you want to have a fun event dinner (bday, valentines, anniversary), I still recommend you go."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,As a college student I was first introduced to sushi at this restaurant and haven't found a better place with tasty rolls like Something's Fishy. Whenever I find myself traveling to southern California I make it a point to stop by this place for lunch or dinner. I have yet to find a place whose Spider Roll tastes as fresh and I also love their Something's Fishy Roll too. I've never had anything except sushi here. Even my husband who doesn't like seafood very much likes Something's Fishy. I docked one star because the place is in dire need of a makeover.

College allowed for only a modest meal and once in a while would splurge with mommy and daddy's emergency credit card fund.  What can they say.... hey I was hungry....and I'm your son.  Enough said!  I loved this place.  Great memories, good food, good staff (friends from school) and good sushi.  Good for dates and friends.

Usually over all pleased w/ them in the past.  NOT THIS TIME!!!  I was w/ a group of 5 at a tepan table.  Our waitress decided to add 20% gratuity on top of total bill and tell us that she could do that.  I always tip 20% or more for good service, but to be told that she could do that...???  I was pissed, and having a food and beverage background myself, I told her that this was not allowed, and that I wanted to speak to her supervisor.  The supervisor made it sound like it was the waitress' fault, and never took ownership.  I saw them 5 min. later standing next to front door/host stand rolling their eyes w/ other servers and looking at our table.  I know they get away w/ this all the time and people just assume that they have to pay it.  This is shady business from top down...  Be aware, check your bill and question it if you come across this terrible practice of business.  Never going back again!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"It's a good deal for sushi since they do half price. I usually call in and get it to go since it's not the nicest sushi spot around. They are usually pretty quick on order prep and the service is good. The place is way over due for a remodel but if that happened I'm sure there wouldn't be anymore half price sushi. So as the saying goes ""you get what you pay for""."

My favs are the Aloha, Something's Fishy and Spicy Tuna Rolls. I've tried a few other more expensive sushi restaurants and though they were delicious, Something's Fishy is just as good. The staff is ALWAYS friendly, especially the manager who I regret still not knowing his name. Next time I'll get it :)

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Came here for a late lunch on Friday and was NOT impressed. Sushi is my favorite. I eat sushi almost once a week. This, this was bland and took forever to get. When we first arrived the host was super nice and sat us right away at the sushi bar. We ordered waters and then he went away. He brought them back along with our waiter and we told our waiter we where getting sushi and would like two green teas. It took a while to get them and I had to ask for the check and he took forever to run my card as well. As for the sushi... We ordered Fresh water Eel sushi and a salmon and shrimp roll. The eel was terribly cooked and the roll was gross. It tasted like mayonnaise. 

Reason I did not give them a one star is because of how wonderful the host was and how quick he brought our water to us and made sure we were happy before turning us over to our waiter."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I've been coming to something's fishy since I was a small child, when it was in Piccadilly square! My husband and I and our 3 small children (all under 7) ate here last weekend. Oh man- it's become a joke!  And we never get sushi here- only hibachi. Anyone who eats sushi here has a stomach of steel!
We had our order in first, yet the chef showed up for the other half of the table(no small children)   As we are watching the best chef there from behind- my kids start getting grumpy and asking where our food is. I'm wondering the same. Then the worst chef ever shows up to cook for us. I have always left with leftovers. This was so freaking disgusting- I left it for the trash!
As stated in previous complaints, the server rarely came to check on us and could tell we were getting pissed. When he brought the check- I almost flipped my lid! He added on a 15% gratuity! Are you kidding me? A couple with three kids gets gratuity added on? We always tip 20% because we both worked in restaurants and know that servers aren't to blame for kitchen issues. When leaving, my husband had to hold me back from the front desk because he didn't want me to make a scene. I am still pissed a week later!  
Oh, and when we were leaving, I lost my balance and touched the chair rail on the wall- oh my god it was covered in grease! The most disgusting thing ever- a think layer on the entire wall and chair rail. This place has not been cleaned in soooooooo long. Never will I step foot in there again!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Besides the utterly dumb name, this is a decent Japanese spot downtown. Like many of its ilk, it tries to do a lot of things - huge sushi bar, dozens of teppanyaki tables with the usual theatrics, and other classic Japanese items. My friend had a Groupon, and we even remarked that it felt like we were seated at the ""Groupon table"" with another family that also had the same chicken and steak hibachi deal :)

The service is insanely slow. Yes, you may be seated at the table quickly, but if another one of the chefs is busy, you might wait 15-20 minutes for the ""show"" to begin. As a consolation, their miso soup and salad are tasty. Like most airlines, everything fancy costs extra. But I thought the portions of chicken, steak, veggies, and rice were tasty and filling, and the trio of sauces we were given helped add another dimension to the meal.

I am only giving this place three stars because of the service, but I will definitely visit again and try more items."

It's the PLACE to BE in Santa Barbara, and with that half price deal on weekday evenings, I feel like a thief when I eat here. A sushi thief. 

You know what, I quit writing yelp reviews!! I'm a sushi thief for life and I don't care what you all think of me! 

Something's Fishy, thank you so much for opening up my eyes to what I really want to be! I'm going to quit my job, and become a vigilante, all in the name of stealing some delicious fish!!

...Shoot. I talked it over with my mom and she said no.

Oh well, I guess I'll just have to GO TO THIS RESTAURANT LIKE YOU SHOULD and get AMAZINGLY PRICED shooshi. 

I recommend all of the ones with cream cheese.

If you need me, I'll be heading to the shelter to watch out for sake bombing."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I am incredibly disappointed in the service at Something's Fishy.  We have visited this restaurant in the past and sat at the sushi bar, and the experience has been fine.  However we recently sat at a table because the sushi bar was full, and we ordered sushi through a waitress.  

The experience was horrendous.  Not only did our server appear very disinterested in our group, but also she failed to take any responsibility when she gave our sushi order to the group sitting next to us, causing us to wait almost an hour to receive any food.  After inquiring about our food multiple times due to the significant delay (and having to flag down our server to do so because she was avoiding our table), we were finally served some sushi, but it was not our order.  We told the bus boy because our server continued to avoid us and failed to follow up on what she served us, and he told our server and the manager at the front.  However, nothing was done.  We again had to seek out our server and physically approach her as she fled from the area near our table.  After telling her that we were sure that she served our order to the group next to us, as they were discussing everything they were served out loud and in a perplexed manner (e.g. they were confused by the veggie roll I ordered), she still refused to admit that she had mixed up the order and made little effort to correct the situation.

After determining that we would never be served with the food we ordered, we left (the rest of my group wanted to eat the sushi we were served with even though it was the wrong order, but I am super picky so I refused, and I was in no mood to continue fighting with the server to get the right food).  On the way out, we approached the manager, who fleetingly apologized while repeatedly saying that there was nothing he could do.  When asked how we would be compensated, he mentioned that we would not have to pay for the wrong sushi order with which we were served.  When we pointed out that we were of course not paying because we were not eating the incorrect order, he said there was nothing else he could do.  I at least expected a better apology, if not some sort of voucher to return and be served with the right order in a timely manner.

My expectations are not usually that high for restaurant service, but waiting over an hour for sushi, being ignored by our server, and not being compensated crosses too many lines for me.  I will not be returning to this restaurant and hope others avoid it too until they can show a little more respect their customers."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The service was good, so that's why I gave it 2 stars, but sadly I got food poisoning. Within the hour of leaving there my stomach began to hurt and about an hour later I was vomiting. I have now spent the past 2 days sick in bed. Not able to hold anything in or down. All I ate was the chicken and steamed rice. I will NOT be going there again."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I was dying to try this place as I am fond of teppanyaki! So we went with my fiancé to celebrate a special occasion. The cook was very nice and tried to amuse the table. So far so good, until the food get in my plate...or should I say on my dress! I barely tried my dish when the waiter comes to take off my fiancé's plate, so curtly that he spilled all the grassy soja sauce from the plate on my white silk dress... But it is not the worst, the worst is the guy not even apologized but made as if nothing happened! My fiancé and I, as well as the other people at the table were all so chocked! As the waiter left me covered of sauce, I finally get to catch another staff member to explain him what just happened. That's when the waiter comes back and speak over my voice and say to his colleague who happened to be his manager (he didn't even talk to me directly!)""come on, i didn't do it on purpose!"". His manager apologized for him but that's it. I had barely touched my dish (it completely cut my appetite!), the night was ruined  AND they made me pay for my meal!!!!! And my dress is ruined as I never get to remove all the stains! This incident happened a couple months ago but I am still so frustrated! it's not my style to write bad comments online, but really I thought they fully deserved it!

Prices were great though (for sushi; I had that Mon-Thurs 1/2 Sushi Special). The sushi wasn't that great. It took FOREVER for the food to come out. We came when there were a moderate amount of people. It took forever for the waitress to take our orders, to get our food and to get our check. We were there for practically two hours. It was like, 20 min to order our food, 1 hour to get our food or  to eat and/or wait for my other friends to get their food, and 40 minutes for our check to come. We and another group were having a difficult time with the waitress that we had to talk the manager. We were suppose to get our money back, too, but I'm not sure if we every went to get it.

Basically, service was bad for us, maybe because we're students. But I hope that wasn't the case. :( Food was alright; good for some, bad for the others. The genji cooking action was awesome and I think my friends enjoyed it (I didn't order it.) All I had was sushi and all I have to say is that it's okay. I had better. My other group of friends didn't like their dishes. They order a seperate side of fried rice with chicken or something. They're orders came really late. They finally got their food when the rest of us finished our food. Their food was cold. The rice and chicken was cold. Many of my friends weren't happy. I don't think we're coming back again. :\"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Been here for the hibachi grill for both dinner and lunch. Dinner time is always packed but not a very long wait. Some people make reservations but I don't think it's completely necessary. The chefs are always nice and the ""show"" aspect is entertaining. My only complaint is that the fried rice is a little bland, but nothing that a little soy sauce can't solve. The noise level does tend to get loud because everyone is sake bombing their hearts out, but it's fun to watch people get hammered. Just think of it as another show!
I love their lunch hibachi deal. It's a four course meal, complete with an ice cream mochi. All for $20 per person! Dinner is usually about $20-25 per person, which only includes the entree. Also had an assorted sashimi appetizer but apparently you have to specify which sashimi pieces you prefer or they choose it for you, even though the menu tells you the four different types of fish you'll get... A little confusing but the server was so nice that I just swept it under the rug. 
Overall, a good place to come with a date and friends!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The service was good, but our steak was over cooked and our halibut tasted like tofu. They gave a very good portion of food but the quality is not worth the price of the meal. I would say it's very mediocre"

First off, 
I wasnt impressed because there were flies flying around everywhere and i saw a fly inside the sashimi case... Talk about gross. I also saw a fly fly onto the waiting to be delivered sushi and the sushi chef saw that i saw that so he took it off the counter and made a new one to be delivered. The sea weed in the rolls were stale . The rolls also had alot of rice and not alot of content in it js untasty rice . The price is good for their happy hour if only the sushi was decent but i would NOT come back here, maybe to try their teppanyaki and for sake bombs ."

My roommate and I enjoy coming here for half-price sushi during the week. I always get the fisherman's roll and salmon nigiri. 

Pros: miso soup comes with your meal, bennihana style, half-price sushi on weekdays

Cons: not good for groups (if you just order sushi, you have to sit at the sushi bar), sometimes it gets really crowded, not the best sushi in SB but decent (especially for the price)"

The fish for sashimi was so f..king thin that I could see thru it.
Dont waste your money there."

Great for a night out with some friends, or a casual lunch. They make a really great roll called 'The Mexican' that isn't on the menu. It has a great kick of spiciness to it! 

I go here about 3-4 times a month and always experience great service!"

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Half-price sushi specials Mon-Fri are the best feature of this downtown sushi spot. With this deal nigiri is alike a dollar plus per piece, and maki (rolls) are around $2.50. Habachi is good too (tho pricey) - the staff gets into it and sake bombs flow. Downsides: sometimes there's a wait bc the 1/2 price special is at the bar only; they never have egg cake; ambiance is not even close to relaxing."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This place is great for kids!

Happy hour prices are reasonable. 

Our chef had a few funny jokes and tricks and entertained kids from 4-7. My biggest issue with hibachi is that the food is either too dry or salty. Not the case. 

Opt for the fried rice - it's super good. 
We had an array of items, vegetarian, shrimp, chicken and steak. All came out as expected and tasty. Portion sizes are relatively large.
The kids menu has sufficient options
Wait staff was attentive and responsive
Service was fast. They had several large parties there and the place was packed so I was pretty surprised at the efficiency of service.
Food came out hot

Honestly, it was nice to have my kid entertained so I could eat in peace, I'd pay almost anything for that type of peace."

He used to come here with big groups of friends to launch a night of underage drinking up and down State St. and now he comes with big groups of hockey kids and their families when we pass through town on our way to hockey tournaments down south.  It's a great place for a big group -  even without a reservation.  The teppanyaki show is great for kids and the noise level of the place on our recent trip drowned out the noise our kids were making.  The teppanyaki is good here and we love the sushi (especially the Something's Fishy roll - spicy) even though you can get better sushi all over SB.  The room is well worn and the atmosphere is raucous on weekend nights and you may feel like you've crashed a frat party, but we love it."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Eh...

The best thing about is place is the 1/2 price sushi deal they have.  If your not going to be able to make it for the few hours that the half price deal is going on...then don't even bother going.

Their sushi is above average which is why the 1/2 price deal is good.  

But their service is lacking in a lot of areas.  Ive been here quite a few times and i find it really hard to get a server who is at the very least friendly.  On several occasions ive been here with friends and our servers were just down right rude.  Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar, that way you have as minimal contact with the serving staff as possible.  

The Tepanyaki here is OK.  If you dont have more then three people in your party ordering tepanyaki, just sit at the bar, the chef won't come to your table unless he feels its ""worth his time"" (at least thats how our oh so polite server phrased it). The last time i checked restaurants are for the pleasure of the consumer.  I will admit that im sure that their cooks work hard and take pride in their skills and are very good at what they do, but there is no excuse for telling customers that the chef doesn't give a rats ass about you. :-P 

Their food is far too overpriced for the low quality and flavor that they offer.  

Like i said before, if you aren't coming for the 1/2 price sushi, then pick another one of the many sushi places in the SB area."

Service was pathetically slow. The food was only so-so.  We had both sushi and Teppan table.  Our teppan table chef did not do any entertaining.  He did light some onions on fire. But no special knife or chopping skills. No flipping of the shrimp into patrons mouths.  No spinning of the raw eggs. Nothing!

Again the food was only so-so and the service was a real killer.   

Avoid!"

The people at the grill looked like they were having fun though."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Compared to some other sushi, its not AMAZING, but its pretty good especially for Santa Barbara. Sitting at the sushi bar is fun, and the service is usually good. The half price days (M-Thurs after 5 or something) make it even better. I've eaten at the main grills once, and the food was really good. Its expensive because you pay by the meal, but worth it, and you get a ton of food. Don't go with a bunch of people expecting a seat at the bar, cause it won't happen. But do try it out sometime, its worth it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This review is just for the sushi served here. My wife and I came here for lunch. We ordered rolls and sushi. I got the rainbow roll and tuna sushi. She got albacore, tuna and salmon sushi. The fish was definitely not fresh and they put too much rice in their rolls. My wife didn't eat one of her albacore sushi because it look like it might get her sick.

Only reason I didn't give this place a one star was because the staff was friendly and attentive and the place was clean. But I would not recommend this place for sushi. Go somewhere else for sure."

Seriously, literally, countless (not even including the two months that I lived there). And I've never really felt inspired to try Something's Fishy. I walk by it on State Street day after day and nothing really calls me in. 

Well this time, with a rumbly tummy and little motivation to walk any farther than the door in front of me, I was seated at the bar before I even knew what happened. The waitstaff was a little difficult to flag down and we were seated at the farthest end of the sushi bar where it sort of tapers off. Not a lot of chef contact happening.  frown face.

We ordered three rolls, salmon sushi and unagi. Everything was made super fast and put all onto one big plate. I know this is a weird issue but I don't like all my rolls on one big plate. It makes it hard for me to distinguish what I'm eating. Just a weird pet peeve.

Not only did the big plate keep me from separating the rolls but the rolls themselves were just plain. Everything was sort of the same. And extremely mediocre. The only thing that really stuck out to me as notably delicious was the unagi. I was tempted to order another one it was so good.

Disregarding the nomnom unagi this entire experience was shockingly blase. Next time, I'll kick myself in the pants and walk a few doors down to any other restaurant on State St."

It was Monday, labor day about 7 pm.
We were seated right away and everyone seemed nice.  We ordered our meals and 4 glasses of water.  Both my daughters glasses were ""cracked"".....But we never really saw our waitress again.  I flagged down a different waitress who brought us new glasses of water, but one of the 2 glasses she brought out had a long crack in it also.
We finally saw our original waitress and showed her the crack in the glass and she brought out another glass and it was fine.
The food was 2-3 stars.  I ordered the chicken which was really good, but my wife ordered the scallops which were funny tasting and smelled a bit off.
My daughter ordered the Hibachi steak which was 3 stars at best.
Our chef was great! He was funny, smiling and made our night!

The food = 3 stars

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Awesome food! So much fun to watch it cooked right in front if you and the tricks they do. Week days sushi is half off but don't worry if you aren't a sushi person. They have lots of other stuff. I highly recommend upgrading to the fried rice. And the steak and shrimp is fabulous. Sooooo good.

This time I arrived at Something's Fishy I was towards the end of a day-long State Street drinking binge.  As soon as I entered, the sake bombs were calling my name.  There's no telling exactly how many I consumed, but let's suffice it to say that I had enough to not remember anything after they brought me my soup and salad.

Not only was our group extraordinarily loud, messy and drunk but we were buying sake bombs for a group of minors across the restaurant.  So thank you Something's Fishy for putting up with our drunken antics and not kicking us out.  Thank you also for not carding those sweet newlyweds who couldn't have been much past 19.

I am only writing this review based off the sushi bar; there was only one sushi chef behind the huge sushi bar that day and his service was on point. However, when it came to our server, it was horrendously slow! We had to be at a wedding and were short on time. Luckily, we waved someone down (maybe the manager?) and he was able to take care of us. Not sure we'll be back again, unless we have a few hours to spend for dining.

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"No. Do not come here. Worst service and food in Santa Barbara. The meal began with a mediocre miso soup and salad drenched in vinegary acid throat-burning dressing.  Following this we had sushi which looked absolutely inedible. It looked sweaty.. How is that even possible? The Hibachi cook took at least 30 minutes to serve us (and no he wasn't busy with other tables, he was fooling around in the back eating fruit snacks. Probably should hide the back kitchen rather than have a huge window looking into it).  When he finally decided to do his job, he managed to mess up every single thing. I am not joking. He couldnt even smile either. Also he cooked one less fried rice than we ordered and when we told him he was short he pouted. Everything (veggies, rice, chicken) was undercooked. Rancid. We had to ask TWICE for a knife to cut each individual piece to make sure it wasn't completely raw. And finally they completely butchered our checks and added a 18% gratuity (as if everything wasn't outrageously expensive to begin with) because why not: f us right? 0 stars. Negative stars. No."

Anyways, we ordered sake and Sapporo so that we could do sake bombs. By the end of sinner we did about 10 sake bombs and went through about 3 large Sapporo and 3 orders of sake between the 2 of us. Lets just say I was feeling good by the end of dinner. Also the waitress and the cook, Lupe did sake bombs with us as well. Also, the manager came by to randomly talk to me and my friend, and he told us how crazy it gets in here with all the college kids, and like right after that, the group we were seated with began to act just as he described, but we had fun! As for the food, we had steak and chicken hibachi with fried rice and also a rainbow on the side. I remember enjoying the rainbow roll, miso soup and salad. By the time the real food came, I believe it was just okay, but I was like 5 sake bombs in by that point! Overall I think its a good place to go with a group to have a good time."

The food has always been delicious each time I've ventured into this hot spot.  The presentation put on by the chef is an absolute treat...bouncing egg yolks, volcanic onions and juggling spatulas---I mean, really---this does not happen everyday for me!  :0) 

Hibachi chicken and shrimp is my favorite with a California roll to share!  Yum!  ;0)  Prices are reasonable and the staff is awesome!  Try it out!  You'll love it!

I have no complaints about the food, but their service leaves a lot to be desired. Both times I've been there the Teppanyaki chef was rude, quiet, and not entertaining in the least bit. He did not engage or do anything special and the servers are even ruder. The first time it took over 45 minutes to receive the check and it was incorrect. The second time I ate there, the chef spilled VERY hot tea all over our table and me. No one offered an apology or even a napkin, not the chef, manager, or server. In fact, the server walked over and placed my salad in the water and just walked away. My friend had to get up and ask for some napkins and a towel. NO ONE cared and trust me, not only was it a mess, but scolding hot tea, does not feel particularly good in your lap. This restaurant has great potential, but they need better training on customer service and just basic etiquette."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Where do I start with this gem? The hostess giving us a 3.5 hours waiting window even though multiple tables were empty or the waiter who acted aloof at every request we had or the chef who looked depressed with his stained apron and half ass attempt to cook the food properly. In short, places like these should not be in business, and people should avoid them at any cost."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I tried going to Something's Fishy on Valentine's Day because I heard that the happy hour prices were amazing. I checked online to make sure the hours were right, then drove 20 minutes to the location. However, appearently they don't do happy hour prices on Valentine's Day. So I drove 15 miles for nothing, then had to find another place to eat. I think its ridiculous they changed their happy hour schedule without notice, simply because they knew people would be going there. Warning: Don't go to Something's Fishy unless you call ahead to see if they've changed their policies 

-Won't be going back because they talk advantage of customers."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"the service was so horrible today, i waited like almost an hour for sushi, (sushi was great like always, and the guys making them awesome) but the waiter was really bad, it took him like 15 min. just to go ask us what we wanted to drink. ok so we ordered our drinks and a dinner box, (dinner box comes with soup and salad) so he brought the dinner box first, then the soup, and when we were finish and ready to go, he brough the rise, but he never bring the salad nor he asked if we need it something. i been there many times and today was a really bad experience with the service."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Well I think this restaurant is great! :)

It is a popular place to go in SB. The sushi is delicious and the atmosphere is great too. If you are sitting at a table you will be entertained by the chef's creative style of cooking. The prices are reasonable... not really expensive. Usually there is a wait, but that doesn't take long. It is worth it.

If you're complaining or contemplating about the quality of food from this place (which you shouldn't :) ) then don't try it. You'll end up disappointing yourself. This is not a high end resort with superb gourmet."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I went to Something's Fishy on Saturday for an early, casual dinner with about ten friends. We immediately sat ourselves at the sushi bar. The service was fast and the sushi chefs immediately made our orders. The sushi was 'ok' at best. I ordered a rainbow roll and sashimi plate. The rainbow roll looked like any other rainbow roll I've ever had, but lacked much flavor. The sashimi plate was a big disappointment. It only included two types of fish. I would not recommend it! On the upside, they do make a big deal, with drums and all, if it's your birthday."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Came here for Julie's 21st birthday. Out of all the places we could have gone in Santa Barbara, we unfortunately chose this place, which we've been to many times. We will no longer go here.

First off, it took them 35 minutes to seat us (group of 4) for sushi. They wouldn't let us sit at one of the 10 empty hibachi tables, because they were hibachi only. This should have been the first warning sign. Eventually, since it was getting late and every other restaurant was practically closed, we pleaded them to let us sit at a hibachi table. They did.

Anyway, we ordered drinks, food, and spent a lot of money. We didn't get a roll we had ordered, but they still tried to charge us for it. Despite it being clear that it was Julie's birthday, they did not bring out a cake like they did for other people, which is fine but annoying. Overall, the service was very bad, and the waiter made it clear she didn't care.

They then put a mandatory 18% gratuity charge on our bill! Wtf?! 

Steer clear of this place."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Heard a lot about this place while living in Santa Barbara but I never got a chance to try it, during a visit back I finally got the chance and I was kind of disappointed... the hostess got confused as to what we wanted (just sushi, not the benihana) and seated us at the table but when our waitress came by asking us what we wanted we said sushi and she got confused and we ended up having to move to the sushi bar (which had very limited seating, you literally touch elbows with the person next to you..) the sushi was ok, kind of plain, the fish didn't taste that fresh (which is a bit weird seeing as how the ocean is RIGHT there, theres no excuse for the fish not being fresh..). I've definitely had better sushi/service/seating elsewhere.."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"What has happened to this restaurant?  Have been coming here for about twenty years.  Last night came with our two sons.  My husband and I split an entree which we often do.  In the past we still would have both received a miso soup and salad.  Not last night.  We were pointedly given ONE miso soup and ONE salad.  Okay fine, no biggie.  Then started to notice the wait for our cook was getting longer and there were no cooks in our room.  I asked the manager what was going on and he said they did not have enough cooks and it would be ten minutes.  Twenty minutes later our cook finally appeared.  No apologies from anyone.  We were given a beer but had already had a beer.  I don't know if there has been a change of ownership, but definitely there is a change in attitude.  Extremely disappointing."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Get any server but Taylor. She should not be server. To start, it was my bachelorette dinner, which we told her and she didn't even say congratulations. She brought miso soups with no spoons. We waited for her to come back and bring spoons but she never did. We had to ask another server for spoons and other utensils because we were missing chopsticks. On top of that 4 out of 5 people in my group got our entrees and 30 minutes later the chef noticed that my friend had no food and we told him we were waiting for a crunchy roll. He then told the manager about it and Taylor said she would check on it. 5 minutes later the manager brought the roll and 15 minutes after that Taylor finally brought a crunchy roll as my friend was almost done with the roll. She realized she messed up and instead of apologizing she said ""shoot"" and walked away. Unbelievable! She also did not offer to refill my iced tea which is a pretty basic server thing to do. Our hibachi chef was great and observant but Taylor was just awful. She never smiled even once. I can't believe she is in customer service with such a cold attitude. I had to just laugh at the situation because it was so unbelievable. Thanks Taylor for making this a memorable night that I will never forget."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is obviously the best and only place to get Sushi in Santa Barbara. 1/2 sushi is the BUSINESS and even when you come on the wrong day, you can always order ""all you can eat sushi"" at a decent price. 

If you're sitting on the bar- don't forget the option to order a lunch box or dinner box. You can never go wrong with that- it has miso soup, like 3 diff. sides, sushi, and tempura! Don't forget to upgrade to fried rice cause it's friggin AMAZING. 

Lastly, if you're looking for a special roll with a bit of a spicy twist, please please please order the Mexican roll. You won't be disappointed. It's an orgasmic experience of salmon, crab, avocado, spicy mayo, jalapeno and all kinds of other good ish! I'm wishing I had one this very moment...too bad I graduated and moved back home 3 hours away. *tears*

Anyways, for families with children, may I suggest coming at a reasonable dinner time...this restaurant does sell alchy && it IS on State st. so if you're coming after 8- expect to be bombarded with ready to party college students. 

Tis all."

The chef Roberto really put on an impressive show and made the dining experience fun, and Entertaining for My Family and I.
Once again thank you Staff and we look forward to our next visit to something's Fishy!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This place is only worth going because of the half price sushi. Otherwise this place is total garb.

#1 Not great quality. The tuna and yellowtail were edible. I, literally, had to spit the salmon out. Tasted like I was chewing on whale poop.

#2 Why would I want Mexis making my sushi? Just like you wouldn't want an Asian making your menudo.

#3 Slooooooooooooow

#4 Check came out wrong.

If Santa Barbara sushi restaurants were the NBA then Something's Fishy would be the Toronto cRaptors."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Let's talk sushi! I personally love the Mexican Roll. 1/2 price sushi is ALL DAY Sun-Thurs and ""All-you-can-eat"" sushi @ the bar ONLY is ALL day Friday & Saturday. If you want Hibachi (the tables where they cook for you)  I would HIGHLY recommend calling in and making reservations ahead of time to ensure your seats; it gets pretty busy. And unfortunately they don't take Sushi bar reservations because there's only what? 26 seats? I mean if your dumb ass reserves 8 seats and you don't come in on time the restaurant looses money by holding your seats for someone who isn't there when there's people that could be sat =( So it makes sense that it's a ""first come- first serve"" policy. Anyways, the filet mignon is to die for @ the Hibachi grill and if you're looking for more bang for the buck try the Dinner Box or the Lunch Box at the sushi bar. It's orgasmic. OH, and don't forget dessert. If you've never had a tempura ice cream you need to try it! DEEP FRIED YUMMINESS. By the way, if you're 21 and up, don't forget to Sake-Bomb it. :) And if you're not into beer like me, try the plum wine. Absolutely love it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Honestly, the sushi is terrible, but this place is not bad for teppan. And for happy hour, it's buy one large saki get one free, best deal for happy hour I've seen yet here in SB. 

Monday through Thursday sushi is half off, but it's not that good. If you're looking for a good experience at this place, go to the teppan grill and you won't be disappointed."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Had my Iphone stolen from our table as it was being bussed. I discovered this while I was sitting at the table only moments later and I informed the management. The management suggested that perhaps my friends who I was dining with took it... and they did not believe that their staff was capable of taking my property. This is all very troubling and I can't support an establishment that takes this stance towards customer service... or lack thereof. I wouldn't trust this place with my jacket, definitely not going to trust it to make me raw fish sushi rolls!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Now I know that as a Teppan Yaki chef you've done your routine a million times: making a flaming volcano out of the onion rings, flipping the rice bowl around with your spatula, etc., but at least try to fool me into thinking you enjoy your job.  Teppan Yaki costs so much because you're supposed to be putting on goddamn show.  Dance, monkey, dance!

Other than our chef being half asleep while he was cooking, the food and service was good.  Finished dishes were removed promptly, glasses were refilled, and any extras we needed were brought right away.  The food was pretty good, probably not the best Japanese food I've ever had, but it was tasty.  I did wish they would've had all white meat chicken as an option.

They have Kirin on tap, which is a nice perk when your Teppan chef is putting the table to sleep with his lackluster moves."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Just got back from dinner there. The place is like the Walmart of benhannias...busy and somewhat dirty.  tons of people runing around and hot ...have they ever heard of AC...maybe with all the grills it gts really hot in there....Also i've never had the smoke from the cooking of the food blow our way the WHOLE time...VENTS...hello use them...other then that, the food was ok, the ICE COLD BEER on tap was GREAT...the waited didn't know the menu which REALLY annoys me...but all in all it was a decent meal."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I've been to Something's Fishy twice. Both times were on Christmas, as it is one of the few places open.

The sushi isn't BAD. The 1/2 priced rolls Monday-Thursday seem like such a great idea. They also put the tip automatically on the bill. Keep your eyes peeled!

The sushi chefs aren't Japanese. Maybe this doesn't matter too much, but...

What I don't understand about this place is why I always leave stinking like fish. I don't feel like this when I leave any other sushi place.

I can't imagine why I would choose to go here again, but if you're broke and need some sushi downtown, I suppose that it could be worse."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,I love going here for Birthday parties! The hibachi is just so fun and the food is always good!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Love love love. Steak and shrimp is heaven. You gotta get the fried rice well worth the extra charge. Sushi is half price on weekdays. PCH roll is awesome. And while not half off the crunch roll never disappoints. Rarely a wait unless Thursday night. You'll wanna reserve a hibachi table for large groups though. You do sit around a table with people you don't know but there's plenty of space and you don't notice. They do a fun little cooking show in front of you. Go between 4-5 for early bird hibachi and it's way cheaper. Worth going to for sure.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Such a disappointment. After dining here for years it has changed it's name (supposedly with the same owners, our waitress informed us) from the creative and fun ""Something's Fishy"" to a boring, cookie-cutter ""Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar"". The waitress was nice enough, but our table of seven ordered a combination of sushi and hibachi and she was unable to deliver it all anywhere near around the same time. We had to ask for one person's sushi (all she ordered) around the time when the rest of us were practically finished with our meals. The man cooking the hibachi was talented, as they all are, juggling his tools etc., but he looked about as bored as humanly possible and not once looked any of us in the eye or cracked any sort of smile. For a to go box I was given styrofoam--hasn't that been outlawed in Santa Barbara? Not going back. Too many other great restaurants in SB."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The hostess sat us down at a grill and never once mentioned that they had one chef working. There was another grill with two people sitting there.  It would've made sense to sit us with them, but the manager never thought about that. After a 45 min wait and finally being told that they only had one chef working, we closed our check and left. It wasn't the waitresses fault, the hostess should've mentioned it to us when we first walked in before being seated. The hostess happened to be the MANAGER!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I would give this place 4 stars in Milwaukee, just 3 stars in Santa Barbara.  The sushi took a LONG time to make.  Instead of putting the sushi out as it was prepared, the sushi chef put all of it out on one platter.  It was very fresh, we were right on the ocean.  Wasn't crowded, we went between lunch and dinner.  Price point about right for area.  No uni, everyplace was out, so not a huge issue.  Food was good, as expected, just wasn't blown away.  I would return if in the mood for sushi."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This place saved me after a trip from Cambria. I remember asking the front desk of our hotel if there was a sushi place in town...he laughed. Much to my surprise the town closes down at 8:00pm on Saturday and Cambria only caters to hamburgers and wine tasting. Which would be fine if I didn't have a hankering for sushi. So you can imagine my delight on our way home when we stopped off at this place in SB for a bite.

Not only was the sushi half off on Sunday from 2:00-5:00pm but they put the nori on the outside so you get more seaweed vs. when it's typically rolled on the inside. It was heaven! Yum! The teppan was okay, I'd rather load up on the rolls next time. Check out my pic of sheer delight!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,The service was good but the food was very mediocre. The chef over cooked the steaks. The fish tasted like tofu.

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I actually really enjoyed this place. I got the hibachi (salmon + fried rice). The performance was entertaining - our cook was friendly. I honestly really loved the salmon. I received a lot more than I expected, which is nice. The salad and sauces were pretty good as well. I recommend this place at night, it's dimly lit and has a nice ambiance. Expensive, but a nice experience. Make sure your whole party is there when you arrive, or else they can't start the hibachi. The wait was a little while, even though we made a reservation (however, it was a Friday night). Never tried the rolls, so don't have anything to say about that."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"My sister and I were quickly seated at the sushi bar on a busy Saturday night. The servers were friendly, and the menu offered half price sushi. My favorite was the crunch roll. 
This place is definitely a good date spot in downtown SB. They also have hibachi tables, which I will go back and try."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I love this place I go here all the time for sushi takeout because the half price rolls are great and they open right around lunch. I get the tuna roll with avocado added which is fifty cents extra but worth it. Also the somethings fishy roll is good and the spicy garlic edamame. I had one bad experience when getting takeout, the to go container was placed in the bad upside down and all the sushi fell in the wasabi. Besides the one bad time this is still a great place for cheap sushi."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Half price sushi here is pretty amazing for the price. I honestly don't know how they afford it. Maybe it's just to bring people in but dont be hesitant to come in here because there sushi prices are low. It's quality
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I am wavering back and forth between a 2 and a 3 for this place, because the food average, but the atmosphere is great. I'm settling on 2 stars though, because it is the food that matters most!

Sushi: Nice 50% off deals, but you get what you pay for! It's better to skip this low quality sushi.

Hibachi: Tried all of the various meat, it's not seasoned/cooked that well - pretty plain. Chefs are average... nothing special. They try to duplicate a lot of Beni's tricks. Not much to rave about here!

This is a fun place to do sake bombs and to go with large groups. If you are looking for quality Japanese food, this place will not hit the spot."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We have ate here several times and never have been disappointed. Setting at the hibachi grill with friends is fun, but I really prefer to belly up to the sushi bar. The half priced sushi is just that, simple but good. The specialty rolls are great. The service from the staff has always been good even when the place is packed. There is not much more to say, the food is reasonably priced  and good. The service is always attentive to their customers. I have ate here twice this week. I hope this helps."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"So me and a large group of friends went to partake of the half priced sushi deal. There were more or less about 12 of us and we all were paying for our own. The size of the sushi was slightly on the smaller side, but it was at a reasonable price. Our waitress was okay and not necessarily great. 

The reason for such a low rating is because the overall service was terrible. We were waiting for a very long time for our food to come out (I worked in a restaurant and even when we had big parties we still bought out the food in a reasonable amount of time. But what really put the nail in the coffin was the fact that they refused to split the bill for us. It took us over an hour trying to figure out who owed what because:

A) we're a freakin' huge party that ordered over $200 worth of food 
B) the receipt had the full price of the items with the total discount listed on the bottom, which complicated who owed what exactly since not all the items were half off

Common sense would say that a restaurant would have a system to automatically split the bill to avoid issues like this and frustrate so many patrons. Common sense would say that the waitress would not blow off said group and put the orders in for us since we are being forced to pay a gratuity. Common sense would also say that the owner of the restaurant should step in at some point and be helpful in trying to help the customers move on with their days. And common sense would say that if you are capable of charging over 12 individual cards a portion of the bill then you owe it to them to make their life easier and split the damn bill. Their excuse was that big parties normally give in and just have one person pay for the entire bill, I'm assuming they get home and go insane from trying to figure out how much they owe the individual. 

As a side note, their women's restroom door for some reason slams, so be careful ladies when you leave."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I find it kind of funny how I find myself missing this place when I never found it entirely delicious when I lived in SB. Perhaps its just the memories of my 8 friends and I weekly gathering along the long sushi bar after a long 6 hour class at Brooks... Or perhaps it was the half-price weekday lunch special that kept our wallets AND our stomachs pleased. The fish wasn't always daily fresh and the rolls could never be compared to Edomasa but the service was decent and the food usually hit the spot. For poor, hungry college students, something fishy is a great lunch spot."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"My friend and I went at 5:25 for the Early Bird menu which is 3-6pm.  Place was empty with the exception of 2 tables.  There was 1 chef.  They would not seat us but instead told us to wait ""maybe 10-15 mins"" because they only had 1 chef.  What??  The chef was cooking for one table and still had the other table to cook for next.  After 15 minutes, no extra chefs, still not seated and not even able to order a drink while we waited, we left.  Maybe they are stalling so we wouldn't be able to order until after 6pm?  I don't know - it was ridiculous to not seat us when place was 90% empty."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I've been coming here for several years. This was actually the place my now husband took me on our very first dinner date years ago. I get it, it's just like Bennihanna. I have fond memories of these types of hibachi joints because we would always go to one for my younger brother's birthday and its my husband's favorite restaurant. Food is just like any other hibachi place. Service is hit and miss. Sometimes awesome, sometimes not so much. Bummer that they stopped giving out matchbooks at the check in. But they do offer 50% off sushi sun-thursday i believe with a coupon i believe. thats always good. I will continue to go here until they really screw up big time. So far, so good."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"My friends and I decided to make a reservation for Something's Fishy for my birthday. We sat down and they didn't even take our order until 40 minutes later. We ordered a variety of things like teriyaki chicken, hibachi, and sushi. The Hibachi grill took 10 minutes, the sushi took 20 minutes, and the teriyaki chicken never came until we had to ask for it multiple times.

Not only was the service extraordinarily slow, while the waiter was taking away my empty sushi plate, he spilled the soy sauce on it all over my lap and onto my nice pants without offering any compensation.
The waiter also messed up my sushi order and had the nerve the make crappy excuses for the overall poor quality of experience like how it was a busy night and how not enough people ordered Hibachi when clearly half our party did.

My party and I were very displeased with how nonchalant the employees seemed with how we were clearly not enjoying our experience and unapologetic for their mistakes. People are always raving about their half off sushi but after this lousy experience with the slow service and attitude towards customers here, you would have to be begging me to come again. Seriously, the food is not worth it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Love this place, Been there a few times, usually with a somewhat large group, so I've sampled almost everything on the menu, Food was well seasoned. The onions were carefully stacked and lit on fire.

Mined you, I LOVE Benihana, figured this place would be some what similar. Well to my awful surprise it was everything BUT! First lets start with the food, the shrimp, lobster and the scallops did not look nor taste fresh. I never thought one could mess up fired rice as bad as this place does. Why was the rice yellow? On top of bad food, the waiter came to our table a total of 3 times, which at one point we were sitting for about 20mins waiting for the cook to come to our table. Not so good customer service, BAD FOOD, and pricy?!?!?  Yeah, I would defiantly NOT come back even if they offered me a free dinner. Sorry...."

It was completely unnerving. I think the idea is to so numb your brain, soul and ears with all the cacaphony that when the (mediocre at best) ""food"" is finally consumed, it will taste like nectar of the holy Divine Beings.

In my case, didn't work. I left with a headache and a weird colored film on my tongue."

We (party of four) went here to eat and we're greeted well and originally served well ..but then our Tappan grill cook came to the table ""Jose"" and my husband asked to add some shrimp to his order ...when all of a sudden manager comes over and walks Jose away holding his arm unnecessarily firm as if he did something wrong ...walks him to kitchen and comes back ...apologizes to us...says Jose was drunk and we'll have a new server......Jose was not a problem yet the manager replaced him. When all we did was ask to add shrimp... we decided to leave rather than deal with this bull...... we consulted Jose after and he was just as confused .... the manager could not explain what happened"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,We love this place. The food isn't out of this world but it's good and consistent. Great prices on sushi and the hibachi is entertaining!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Best in town for any occasion, we usually go for bdays or weekends with the family!! Kids love it as well, if you are in town you should go, you won't regret it foods always on point"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,I've been coming here for about a year now and they consistently have the most delicious and well-priced sushi in Santa Barbara. You really cannot beat the prices and the quality! The restaurant looks a little unassuming but take a seat at the sushi bar and order the Something's Fishy roll--you will not be disappointed!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"4 stars: 3 stars for food & services, 1 extra bonus star for the fun experience I had with my friends both times I've been here. First time I came with my bf, friend & her bf: there were 4 of us. Second time I came with my sister and her friends, there were 6 of us. Both times we did the whole Hibachi/Benihana deal.

The food was alright, average tasting. I would say the best part of the meal was the fried rice. Our chef was cool & funny. Of course he did some tricks (flaming onion volcano) and rhythmic banging while he cooked. I had a good time with my friends here.  I wouldn't come back for the food per se but wouldn't mind coming back for another fun experience."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I can't believe how a ""supposedly nice"" Japanese restaurant located in the prime center of downtown state street can be so disorganized and sloppy. I took a super hot date here a couple days ago expecting amazing service but received the complete opposite. Where do I start... let's see.. for starters, when we sat down at the sushi bar (without any hostess attending us lol) we were simply thrown 2 menus from the chefs without a single word from them. I wasn't told what to do from the start nor did anybody seem to care when I was ready to order. I had to hand the menu back myself. After that, we literally sat there for 50 minutes before someone came to give us Water. 50 MINUTES. Let that sink in. I've never witnessed such pathetic and disrespectful service before. Given we were sitting at the sushi bar, I could see everything the chefs were doing. It took them 40 minutes just to GET to our order and start preparing it. Keep in mind we ordered a salad which means all these cucks had to do was grab the salad and toss it onto a plate. But guess what? It took them 50 minutes to do that as well!!! LOL!!! On top of the fact that NOBODY asked us what we wanted to drink or if we needed anything, we were ready to get up and leave.. but my smoking hot babe of a date insisted on staying since we were both starving. Our food finally came 50 minutes after we sat down, and I had to raise my hand and ask for my own drink. Get this, I asked for a certain soda and instead I was brought tea... I don't understand who you people hire but you need to get your shit together. 50 minutes to give us water and food... 50 MINUTES!!!!!! I was sitting at the table for almost an hour before anybody even offered us anything.. It was as if they didn't even know we were there lmao.... and yes they were aware of us because multiple servers kept serving the people next to us and looked at us.. pathetic Dweebs

That being said, that night will be the last time I ever come back to that god forsaken scat-worthy service place again."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,The food was great we had habachi steak and shrimp with fried rice ! The service was very attentive  from the host and server. The server Ivan was funny always making jokes and our glasses were never empty . The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the chef was unfriendly and seemed rushed but he did cook good food .
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Excellent sushi bar, staff was attentive and AND!! Food was great.

Big foot roll
Mexican roll
Crinchy roll
Tuna, yellow tail, salmon, white seabass shashimi

$8 beers, the tall ones"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Came here a bunch the past couple years while at UCSB and noticed I never gave them a review. You want budget cheap sushi sushi? Come here. 1/2 off rolls and sushi all day every day. Recommend the Santa Barbara & Catalina rolls.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Sat down an hour ago. No food yet... Might just leave and get a burger. Worst birthday ever.

Finally came over, offered us extra shrimp for the wait. I said no because I don't want shrimp. They have us shrimp any way. Covered in lemon, I'm allergic...

Just want to get out of here."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We always eat here when we visit SB. You can't beat 1/2 off sushi rolls on weekdays. Their Tomson and Catalina rolls are the best! Also the service is great and the sushi chef is excellent. This last time we went in, July 2012, it was the freshest and best yet."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Ever since I ate here, I've been thinking and talking about it with everyone who asks me for restaurant recommendations. It was pretty busy when I came here, but the service was still extremely fast! I felt a little bad, I must've looked really bored because the chef saw me with my chin in my hands and handed us cucumber salads while we were waiting. I thought that was really awesome customer service. Even with how busy he was with other peoples' rolls, he saw that we were waiting and gave us stuff to eat in the meantime. The Christmas roll really stood out to me, it was delicious! Definitely looking forward to coming back here"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Something is certainly fishy about the place.. Overpriced, check, dead fly in salad, check, dry chicken, check. You are lucky I gave you 2 stars (I didn't get food poisoning so you have that going for you). I hope there are better places to eat in Santa Barbara than this.. Unfortunately I wasn't able to visit them on my brief weekend trip."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We had the sushi tonight. Very fresh and delicious. I was a big fan of the Something's Fishy and my date enjoyed the Spicy Tempura Shrimp and Avocado. Good place for a quick bite, sushi prices are very reasonable."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Best hibachi and sushi in town! The sushi is half price all day every day so super affordable. If you want a fun family dinner or dinner party I highly recommend the hibachi tables! The chefs put on a great show and the food is amazing!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,From Sunday through Thursday day night most rolls and sushi is 50% off. Hibachi is also discounted on Sundays and I believe through Thursday as well. The service is great and they make you feel at home. The hibachi chef is amazing and makes you enjoy his artistic skills when preparing your food. The sushi rolls are fresh and delicious. You can sit at the sushi bar or grab a table. The host and the people that work that do a great job. Enjoy an excellent restaurant.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,I GO HERE ALL THE TIME! I really love this place and i really love good sushi. I always have the tomson roll as it is one of my favorites. but if you wanna splurge a little go for the super dragon roll. taste is fantastic! The chefs and employees are nice and the hibachi is so fun! Dinner and a show. They can get a little slow at times. but i don't mind since that's to be expected at any restaurant especially if they are busy. Great Place. Thank you for being one of the best sushi places i go to! :D
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I have been here a few times , this time I felt bossed around and rushed.

I have experienced better from this very restauarant, don't let me down again."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"It was a fairly slow day so the service was fairly fast. Our waitress Megan was on top of everything. Didn't even let my cup get lower than half empty with water. Ordered a beer and the Hibachi Steak and Chicken. Was cooked perfectly medium rare and was real tender and juicy. The chef was really good and were relating on several things, considering I'm a chef also.
Great service and great staff"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is my favorite sushi place in Santa Barbara, hands down. I have been going here since I was a freshman in college and continue to go there whenever I can. The Santa Barbara Roll and the Something's Fishy Roll are my favorites that I ALWAYS get. Half price off regular sushi rolls all the time, great service, and great prices.  What more can you ask for?"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Mexican roll was fabulous.  Service was fast. Great experience overall.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I like lunch box, sushi and ramen here. High quality with good price! Great options for lunch."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Can you say amazing?? I can!!!

This place blows my mind every single visit!! I love going in for their amazing sushi and the amazing show the chefs do. Hiro is the man!! He takes pride in his work and makes the best specialty rolls in the area. The staff is super friendly and there can be a bit of a wait on Friday and Saturday nights, but nothing a reservation can't solve."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Took my boyfriend out for a birthday dinner, used the Groupon for the steak and second meat option. The food was pretty good, really enjoyed the fried rice. Steak was a little over cooked (asked for medium rare, not a lot of pink) but still a pleasant dinner. Had a really good time, suggest getting the hot sake and beer. Large portions! And free green tea ice cream for the birthday :)"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,Believe the previous reviews that say this place is bad.  We saw the mixed reviews but chose to try it instead as my son loves this type of food.  The service was bad from the very beginning.  A rude host that barely spoke English and our waiter could not be found throughout the night.  The food was bland and quality was mediocre at best.  Save your money and don't bother with this place.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is my go to for affordable and pretty good sushi! I like pretty simple sushi so mine is always good, but I wouldn't come here if you're looking for something ""amazing"". I love that you can always be seated within minutes, they allow you to bring in a bottle of wine for only 1$ per person! And their hibachi is super fun. I'll definitely be back for my next date night !"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I've had better sushi, much better, but it was a nice place to land while walking the streets all day. The place was clean, and the service was good. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there though. The location is wonderful, and the prices were reasonable for what you get in return. I missed the half priced sushi, which sucked."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Awesome. The staff was super attentive and knowledgable and friendly! The food was amazingly delicious an reasonably priced, the restaurant was clean and ambiance was wonderfull. I will return again!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Just did review of Gyu Kaku and made me think of this place.
Many years ago this used to be a good place to get decent quality
hibachi and cheap rolls/nigiri.
Over the years and quality disapeared and the only Japanese working there were the waitresses.
I ended back in there earlier in the summer and yes..
still the same O~some O
They have a prime location, if you go to SB to shop you will walk by this place. To bad the food doesnt speak for its self anymore."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We loved the cooking show, it was my 1st experience. The chef was very skilled and did some trick moves.
Steak, rice and vegetables were delicious. 
Service kinda slow but ok"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"We've been coming to this restaurant less and less in the last few years.  Last Tuesday was yet another confirmation why.  Took at least three repetitions to get them to correct my wife's order that they misunderstood.  And, of course, having come in with two children, they placed us at the ""kids table"" with a God-forsaken 2 year-old from hell.  Howling at 100+ decibels, running free throughout the place, taking things off of shelves (including other patrons' purses), this kid was hell on earth.
    Admittedly, we messed up when we forgot to include our Axxess discount card.  And they kindly agreed to refund the original amount and do a new charge with the discount.  But then were somehow unable to reprocess the new amount, and made us go get cash.  For $150 for 3 adults and one child (our 2nd is still an infant) we deserve better."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Hibachi grill restaurants are definitely great places to celebrate special occasions such as birthdays. We decided to go for my roommates birthday. The service was a bit slow, but pretty friendly. 
They give plenty of food; soup, salad, fried rice, vegetables and your entree. For my entree I ordered the vegetarian tofu and vegetables, and boy was that a mistake. It was honestly just plain tofu and bell peppers, no flavor what so ever. 
They didn't even try to make an effort to make a creative or appetizing dish. The other sides were okay, very bland and lacking much flavor. 

Overall not the best Japanese restaurant, then again Santa Barbara does not have many options for those craving good Japanese food.

I'll stick to Benihanna"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"We were there for Teppanyaki dinner.
It is really fun watching the chef cooking in front of you doing some fire tricks however the food is not that good for the price.
So it is just a one time deal. :("
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This place is good and fast!! They make it right in front of you if you too! Super cool would recommend.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We ordered the Hibachi dinner which includes a miso soup, salad, rice (steamed or fried) and a choice of meat: steak, NY steak, shrimps, scallops ... or a combination of those. The server brought us the soup and the salad first. The miso soup was OK  but the salad - just a bunch of lettuce leaves drowned in dressing sauce. After 10-15 minutes, the steamed rice is served to us and short after the chef arrives.
I got steak it was ok. Even though I ordered medium, I got  well done. Service is nice and I like how to see a chef cook in front of us."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We had a wonderful meal here. We sat at one of the hibachi tables and had a mix of the hibachi dinners and sushi. It was a lot of fun watching the chef and the food was delicious. The sushi was okay, nothing special. High marks for excellent service and Kirin on draft."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Okay, probably the weirdest names of all the sushi places that I have been, but gee, the sushi here is cheap and also good! 

I'm not saying it's the freshest, the most complex or the most authentic, but the deals they have for the quality they offer for happy hour are by far the best I've seen. 

I live in Minnesota where eating sushi makes you raise an eyebrow (I'm how far from the nearest ocean??) and hemorrhage cash. Even with happy hour prices. When I came here, I got all the sushi I wanted for under 15 dollars. Glory Hallelujah. 

Of the happy hour specials, I highly recommend the spicy yellowtail. It has a good amount of fish, the fish is left in chunks (not chopped up like spicy tuna), and a delightful spicy sauce. So good!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I've definitely had better sushi...much better.

The rolls were sloppily made and were 75% rice with barely any sushi, if any. And they add the sauce on like it's the main ingredient! THE FISH IS THE MAIN INGREDIENT! I feel like I was being tricked into believing that what I was eating was sushi. 

Service was ok. I'm a big believer in good service. But 30 minutes of waiting with no water and having to ask the waitress to get us water is a big no no for me. And I was a waiter for sometime and I NEVER let my patrons go without getting their drink order.

Maybe I'm too big of a snob or maybe this place isn't that great. Something is fishy alright, and it's not the sushi."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,Dont be fooled by half off like we were.  They are doubling the price on the simple rolls that are normally $4-5 elsewhere.  Plus the portion is small!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I normally love this place for dinner but this Sunday 5/5 I had the worst experience and it wasn't because of the food. It was the manager Manny. I ordered 2 rolls over the phone and I knew they were busy but they guaranteed me a 20 minute wait. I was driving from Ventura to Paso Robles so I said it would be fine since I would rest for a bit while I waited. When I went in there they told me it would be another 15 minutes and I could clearly see it was busy so I understood completely. Now...15 minutes later I return and he tells me it will be another 15 minutes. By this point I was irritated because I still had a 2 hour drive and it was 8pm now. So I asked him if I could have my money back instead because it was getting late and how I wish he would have not gave me a time frame because it was not accurate whatsoever....maybe I came off rude but I was just frustrated. Manny went off to saying how he wouldn't give me my money back because the roll was already in the oven, and if I wanted I could speak to the chef making it. Then he said he wasn't a mind reader to know what the customers at the tables were going to order and therefore it was impossible to give me an exact time. I did not reply to him...and when I finally received my food I asked him for a small side of sriracha which to he replied ""only if you have a dollar"". I just smiled and walked out. For such a Busy and delicious place, I'm shocked at the poor management they have. Customer service is definitely not Manny's priority, he's just there for a paycheck."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"LETS BE REAL. half off sushi...ALL THE TIME? You would be crazy to not love this place. ALL of the sushi chefs there are so nice, especially HIRO (pronounced hee-row). He is so kind and our sushi comes out to us on time, ALL the time, not to mention how amazingly neat the presentation of the sushi is.

Hibachi is great for large groups, they definitely accommodate to bigger parties, and their service is no less than when you come with one other person, or ten. They're all kind!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,This is the only place in town that i know of that does it Hibachi style. My tip would be to go during the daytime for more affordable pricing. I always stick to the hibachi shrimp and chicken or scallops. I also love the fried rice!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"My husband was really excited to go to a hibachi restaurant, as it's one of his favorite dining experiences.  We were disappointed and recommend finding a different one.  Here is why,

We came in early for a late lunch/early dinner and service wasn't friendly.  Older hostess seemed a little annoyed seating us, even though we had called ahead.  The waitress was a bit rude and the hibachi chef wasn't very friendly and a didn't really make us feel like he wanted to be there.

I think hibachi grills are really about the chef and interacting, we (my husband and I) both discussed after 
the chef walked away that we felt like the overall experience with all staff was just weird.  Everyone seemed like they really didn't want to be there that day, it was odd.  

This place has a great location in a busy area but I'd recommend going a little out of your way to find another one.  Maybe we just got unlucky and it's typically better then this?  Who knows but I'll check out a different place when in SB again."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Writing this review to express my disappointment that they no longer feature a happy hr on beer and saki.

Seriously I come here because the mediocre sushi is well priced and its the best mediocre sushi in town in my opinion. 

That being said the happy hr 2 for 1 dos equis and saki was a major reason for me to frequent this place. But they did away w that. Why? No clue. 

Terrible Move.

I may still go here for the half priced rolls - which honestly shouldn't even be called that anymore since its the normal price anyway.

My visits will certainly be less frequent tho due to their terrible decision of doing away w happy hr drinks. 

Thanks Somethings Fishy, you just became immensely more mediocre.

Out"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Well it has been a couple of years since I've been here, so things might have diminished. From what I remember though, the food was pretty darn good. 

I don't eat sushi...so can't comment about that. 

The teppanyaki food was really good...the fried rice is second to none, the shrimp and chicken are pretty good also. I wouldn't really care if they cooked it in the back somewhere, but whatever...I don't need eyebrows anyways. 

Living in the Bay Area now...this is one of the few places in Santa Barbara that I do miss on a regular basis. Yes...I have not found an equal here in San Francisco."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,DLove this restaurant. Good food and very good service.  BF and I had teppanyaki and they give big portions.  Would recommend to friends and family.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Came to visit my Daughter and found this lovely little Hibachi steak house. The food was delicious and well proportioned. The food was flavorful and the servers were attentive. Our grill master was very generous with the portions and I even though I had the Filet and lobster I even go to sample some of the shrimp.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,I've only had food from the hibachi grill here and it was pretty good. Benihana-like feel. Their sushi is also half-off on weekdays. Don't go with a big group with this place. They flake with service and you don't get very high quality food since the hibachi chefs don't focus too much on flare and more on efficiency.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"It was my second visit to this place, and I really enjoyed their food and service again! If you haven't tried their filet mignon, you should definitely try it! Their regular streak is very good, but filet mignon is just so exceptional!! It totally worth paying extra $!! I also loved their fried rice very much. My almost four years daughter usually does not eat fried rice, but she kept eating it as it was so good :) Her another favorite was shrimp, which was very delicious too. She is already looking forward to going back to this place, and we will do for sure!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,A very nice eating experience. Haven't been here in a while. Used to be named Something's Fishy.  Still great quality food and excellent service.

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This is basically a bennihana.  You get a decent amount of food and a ""show"".  Good for groups.  Can get busy on the weekends with tons of UCSBers doing sake bombs."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"My fiance' and I love our sushi and dim sum and in Santa Barbara, it is quite limiting so we were excited to see this catchy restaurant name, Something's Fishy.  But when we yelped, it didn't look good.  But that place seemed pretty busy so we decided to give it a chance.  Well, Yelp reviews were right.  We gave it 3 tries because, like I mentioned, good sushi are so limiting in this neighborhood and sometimes restaurants just have off days especially when prices are really low.  In short, our experience goes like this..

*  The first time we ate there, it was substandard in quality.  Meaning, it didn't incite us to eat more. The waiter was punctual but the sushi maker takes off for 15 minutes and when he came back, he forgot our order so we ended up just asking for the check.  No apologies were offered.  

*  The second time at the sushi bar, the sushi maker again forgot an order, the very first one we put in.  The second order was being made, we saw with our own eyes the sushi maker taking out a roll of raw fish from a counter height freezer behind him, and when he gave us the plate, it smelled like chlorine.  It made me nauseous and we asked for the check.

*  The third time I braved myself and said ok, this is the last try and I know I've been generous in giving it a chance.  Took a girl friend there and after we put in the order, a big huge horse fly showed itself in the refrigerating glass case fronting us.  It was just flying around.  So, we waved the sushi maker down and pointed it out to him.  He grabbed a paper napkin and chased it down and killed it, and wiped the glass with it.  I said that's it, I'm NEVER going there again, and I must share this or my conscience won't be clear.  The manager didn't seem to care.

Yuk and so unfortunate."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Came here for dinner after the urban wine trail on Saturday night. The place was packed but we managed to make a reservation the same day. We got the steak and the shrimp which was really good. 

Service was also good as well. I'm not sure why the low stars but I lived in SB for 4 years and this is one of its more famous places. I would definitely check it out if in the area."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,The sushi bar is quick and service is friendly.  Their half off specials during the weekday are amazing!  Sitting at the bar makes for a wonderful expereince.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This place was 50% great, 50% bad. The problems were the service and the unexpeced mayonaise in all rolls claiming to contain ""crab"". It would be more accurate to have ""krab mayo salad"" as the ingredient. My friends and I hate mayo in sushi, so this was a big disappointment. It was difficult to get our waitress's attention after placing our food orders, so it was difficult to get drink refills.

On the other hand, the nigiri was delicious. We happily devoured several pieces of albacore and yellowtail. The hibachi chef was entertaining and the hot food was delicious."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Fun place to go with a group anytime or for special occasions. The sushi is decent. I would recommend the hibachi even though it is a bit pricey. They have a pretty good menu of items to choose from and the chefs that cook at your table are very good and entertaining to watch. They do get busy so it's best to plan ahead otherwise you might have to wait for a table. The service can be slow sometimes which is not uncommon in Santa Barbara..  They have some good lunch specials and half price sushi on certain days but if sushi is what you want, there are better places to go."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"They do a very good hibachi Japanese show by cooking the raw food right in front of you on a large cooking plate. Depending on which cook you will get, they each do different tricks such as juggling with an egg on a knife, building and lighting up a volcano made out of onions rings, as well as diverse fire-related tricks.

This atmosphere gives a good entertainment for younger kids and also always a good experience to have watching the cook going crazy with your food before giving it to you once perfectly cooked. You can also ask the cook how you want him to cook your meat precisely which is appreciable. One advice I would give you is to share one of the combo with somebody as ordering too would basically give you almost the same amount of food, plus the quantities are quite large.

Also, they offer half off rolls on the sushi bar during the afternoon which is quite nice.
However, we regret some of the servers being a little absent minded and forgetting to bring the drinks or refills. Good place to hang out with your friends."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Great server and food was good. Miso soup was delicious, poke salad was yummy, but we saw our food for the hibachi sit out  in the open for at least 10 minutes which was unnerving but the food turned out really good. 

Our hibachi cook was funny and cooked most things good.  I got the shrimp and scallops. The shrimp was good but the scallops were a bit tough. My husband got the filet and chicken.  Both were delicious. 

I'd recommend this place to friends and family."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Excellent if you're in college and want to have a fun drunken evening w/ your friends, sake-bombing at a place just like Benihana's....not so great if you plan on taking your parents there! Noisy, and not the best environment for families:)"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Their sushi is delicious! They have a huge selection. I am only not as thrilled by their hibachi meals with meat. I would recommend ordering any of the fish selections, and probably their steak, but the chicken is mediocre and not all white meat. They also have an excellent calamari and jalapeno appetizer that is so tasty!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This restaurant is one of my favorite spots around Santa Barbara to come to when I want affordable, but still good sushi. I always order off their half priced menu. Most of the time, I order two rolls and a couple of pieces of nigiri since you can't just order sashimi. The times I have gone, the nigiri was melt in your mouth (salmon and hamachi). I give this four stars because it seems like they don't use the same quality of fish in the rolls. Love this place, will come back to try their teppanyaki."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,Okay I'm giving this place a 2 star only because we weren't able to share a meal here.  Cheapest was $11.95 for the chicken kabachi.  I had surgery on my stomach so I am not able to eat an entire meal on my own... and the resturant didn't want to accomodate.  We left and went to Wahoo's instead and I ate 1/2 a taco... YUM! =)
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The service is terrible, all the employees I have interacted with seem to have serious beef with life, and possibly the whole universe. The salmon sushi does not contain sushi-grade salmon, it is chewy and rubbery, nothing near the melty divinity that sushi deserves. The vibes are bunk, and the place looks dim and disheveled on the inside. They never specifically wronged me, but this is not a quality eating establishment, and the point of Yelp is to help people like you avoid these places. The only thing that makes this restaurant maybe worth it is the ""half-off sushi."""
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This review is only for the sushi:

Hmmm... I knew something was fishy when there was not ONE Asian chef, let alone worker, hah (j/k)! Anyway, we decided to go here only because it was a happy hour half-off deal.

We sat at the bar and the service was pretty slow with two chefs. At some point, one chef was just standing there doing nothing while the other one was busy tending to a few orders. It's possible that each chef has his own section, but I don't see why they don't help each other out. Especially since the chef was working so slowly. We ordered a little at first because we wanted to try some before getting more. This took a while to come out. We gave him the second order and I swear it took another 10 minutes for it to come out. Imagine waiting, eating a little bit, and having to wait 10 more minutes to eat a little more. I feel like in addition to the chef just being a slow worker, another reason why it takes so long is because they put all the finished rolls on one plate, instead of giving us each roll one by one after each is finished.

The sushi itself wasn't bad, but just okay. We did not like the rice - it had a strange texture. My boyfriend says it's most likely because they undercook the rice, then premix it with vinegar, and leave it warm to preserve it (he used to work at a Japanese market).

In short, the service was slow and the rice had a funny texture. Going here for sushi is good during happy hour, but I wouldn't recommend it at full price."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Meh. This place wouldn't make the cut in LA but I guess when you're pretty much the only ones doing Japanese in SB, there's nothing to compare it to."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"We had a large group of 11 so the first place we were going to go to (Holdren's) there was an hour and a half wait.  This place was able to accomodate us with only a half hour wait so we decided to go here instead.

It was pretty fun doing the teppanyaki experience.  Our chef wasn't very great but it's better than Benihana's.  The onion volcano was pretty weak but he was good at flipping the bowl of rice and catching it with his spatula.  We ordered the filet mignon and scallop combination and the New York Steak and shrimp combination.  It comes with quite a bit of food.  You get miso soup, salad, fried rice, grilled vegetables, and mochi ice cream dessert.

It did take a long time for a chef to become available and come to our table.  We were quite hungry so maybe that's why the food tasted better.  But most of the grilled stuff came out a little overcooked.  Bill for 11 was close to $400.  It included a 20% mandatory gratuity which the waitress didn't really earn."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This is the place to get your sushi fix. Half off during the week. Always bomb. The hibachi is always a sight and a good time for dinner.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Loved this place! Not to mention it saved the day......made reservations for my brothers graduation at another restaurant on state street which did not work out, didnt know what to do. We were going to come here in the first place but made a bad judgement call and decided to go to the other place. When things didnt pan out I immediately called to see if they could accomodate a party of 20 who was down the street. The manager was amazing, it was a saturday night, my party was large and hungry. The service was great and it was very busy as well. Over all I would definitely recommend this place and go there again. I see why its a fave of the students and visitors alike. Thanks again!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Great service & food. I come here all the time to get my sushi fix. I usually go to the sushi bar which is full at times, but the wait time isn't bad at all. Everyone is really nice, as well as accommodating. You also cannot beat the half off sushi prices. Really great deal!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Sushi is not fresh and lots of rice and  very small fish inside. 
Service was okay tho. 
Please do not waste  your money on this place ."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"NOTE: This review applies ONLY to the sushi bar, not the Hibachi tables. 

My boyfriend and I could find almost nothing open for dinner on Christmas. The SB Brewing Company which we love but don't go frequently (he sometimes goes for lunch as their chili is outstanding and not expensive, making for a good lunch for 8 bucks plus an iced tea and tip) was open but then we passed Something's Fishy. 

I went all the time in high school and college to the Malibu location on PCH. My friends and I would go for sushi and sake and they never carded us which is a real plus when you're underage. 

The hibachi looks great and it's very reasonably priced.  However, the sushi is subpar, mediocre at best 

There is a perennial ""happy hour"": 7 days a week, no time limitations. 

If everything is always happy hour--half price--then it ain't happy hour; it's just cheap. 

The salmon was bad and we sent it back. The sushi chef is very affable and it's not his fault the fish is so so. The mackerel was by far the best, the octopus not so hot. I didn't mind the tuna but I will never eat there again for sushi. It's a warehouse which bears zero resemblance to its Malibu brother/sister restaurant. 

I do not know if it's the same ownership or if this is now a franchise independently owned and operated, which I suspect that it is. 

It's cheap: this is the best you can say for it. And the service is just fine. 

The cooked food looked quite good and they do have a large filet mignon and lobster special for 34.95, which if the lobster tastes good, is not bad. 

The bargain is the ramen and it looked fine but I didn't taste it. 

I think it is a THREE STAR for the cooked food/Hibachi and a 1-2 star for the sushi.

You can get sushi TEN times better at Whole Foods, Gelsons or Lazy Acres, which a few years ago created a sushi section with delicacies like Ikura. Something's Fishy doesn't even sell Ikura (salmon roe eggs, fishy bundles of wonderfulness, like pink caviar)"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Where do I begin??? The place is filthy. The windows haven't had a genuine scrubbing ever. And then there's the wait. On a Tuesday night we were (party of five) sat down for hibachi...we were checked on every 15 to 20 minutes! We waited for one hour! No explanation was given-no apologies! We were asked in the form of a statement: You guys okay. 

As far as the food? They are clearly chasing the tail of a comet. They charge the same if not more than Benihana's for food that is a notch better Panda Express.  The miso soup didn't have any soy in it. The fried rice didn't have any chicken in it. The vegetables were as hard as wood (not tender at all). The waitress seemed more and more afraid to approach our table as the night progressed. Our smiles had vanished and our dismay was obvious. But without opportunity to complain or appraise our service; A 17% gratuity was automatically added to our bill. 

Reading this now, I realize that we could have complained but we had a long day of sight seeing and we were exhausted. We didn't research enough. But to our defense we thought a restaurant on State Street in Santa Barbara would be at least clean and ready to tend to many customers. But the thing is: There weren't tons of people in there! So they have no excuse for their lack of professionalism. I guess Soki bombs and beers are what's keeping the lights on at this place. Something is fishy indeed."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"The sushi rolls are amazing! This has to be my favorite sushi spot, and they are phenomenal at helping patrons with allergies!! The wait staff is always slammed so I understand why they aren't the best at observing say drink refills, but the food absolutely makes up for the service. Not only is their sushi bar the best price in town, in my opinion it tastes the best, but their hibachi station chefs are incredible!! I highly recommend checking out this spot!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This is my favorite sushi place! With the best price in this very expensive town. I always get the same roll because is delicious lol big foot roll!!!! Order if you get a chance! And Hero (hiro) is the best he always remembers my order and makes me feel at home! I definitely recommend it!!! A must go in Santa Barbara!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Something's Fishy is our ""go to"" place! We do hibachi with Carlos for any large group celebration... Birthdays, going away parties, and employee dinners... And sit at the bar for a quick sushi lunch, as it seems they constantly have happy hour! The service is great, they make you feel like a friend, rather than a customer!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,We went there Christmas Eve had the fillet Mignon dinner the steak was perfect came with three prawns fried rice  and vegies all was prepared at our table 20 dollars each ! we also had california roll and two others I don't know the name of but they where all half price would go there again
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This used to be my favorite sushi place in high school. Unfortunately, I've gone in quite a few times and have been disappointed. It's really hit or miss here. Sometimes the fish and rice are fresh, other times, like a couple days ago, its not. The fish and the rice were spoiled (ordered California and Rainbow rolls). The miso soup wasn't bad, but it wasn't delicious. I'd rather pay extra and go to Sushi Teri, Sushi GoGo, or Sushi Tyme. 

The service on the other hand has been great every time I've come in."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Went here with my sister and was seated at the sushi bar pretty much immediately which was very nice. One thing that struck me as odd was that when we tried to order a side dish from the waiter, he said we had to write it on the piece of paper we gave the sushi chef. When we wrote it on the paper for the sushi chef, he told us we had to order it from the waiter, which was frustrating cause we were simply trying to order fried rice.
We got our food about 10 minutes later and it was pretty good. Not amazing. But pretty good. 
The reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because both me and my sister got food poisoning from it the next morning. It made me think twice about how I had seen the sushi chef not use gloves but touch all the food and multiple containers and other things without washing his hands. 

My advice is skip the food poisoning and go somewhere else!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I don't care for sushi snobs that refuse to eat anything that's not ""teh best.""

I love a great quality burger on artisanal bread with a high-quality local cheese and organic produce, but sometimes I just want a effin Big Mac with fries and a coke. 

This is not quite the McDonalds of sushi, but it isn't first rate, however, when you're eating half price sushi on a tuesday afternoon, you shouldn't expect it to be.

I love the bento boxes as well, especially before they raised the prices.

The hibachi thing is hit or miss, depending on the chef you get, and really is kind of for tourists, so if you're in to that sort of thing... have fun with it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I would definitely come back.

Although the chef didn't say much (which I guess is kind of a bummer for teppenyaki) but my meal was delicious!  My chicken was cooked just right and the shrimp was awesome.

I would like to try the sushi, especially since it's half off M-Th."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,Either this chef sucks or the rules he has to follow make him suck. This place has no type of good spicy sauce. They barely put oil or butter on anything. The rice was the worst I've ever tasted also had no bacon in it. This place missed the mark today. I will tell everyone how much it sucks. Never again. The only up side was that the egg rolls were good.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Loved this place! Nice setting, fun and friendly staff and of course great food. Only thing I didn't like was their iced tea I had to sent it back other than that great place will go again. Oh, best fried rice ever."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Great food! We had steak and calamari, it comes with salad, fried rice and vegetables. Wonderful show from the chief while cooking on the stove in front of us! Highly recommend!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,California roll & Philadelphia Roll (no rice) with a side house salad. Bomb!!!!! With veggie spring rolls. This place is a must especially with half price sushi sun-thur
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"So yummy! They cooked up one of the best New York steaks my boyfriend and I have ever had! We also got the shrimp, and it was just as great. We loved watching the chef make our meal right in front of us, especially the fried rice! A surprising favorite of ours was the spicy edamame- whatever sauce they used was perfect. I definitely recommend coming here, it was our first time and now it's a favorite- we even want to come back tomorrow!. Delicious."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,The only hibachi style restaurant in Santa Barbara and it is most definitely worth a visit! Great service and some of the best chicken and shrimp I've ever had! Its a great place to have a dinner party and the chefs who come out to make your food do it right in front of you!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Had first and last dinner here last night.  I don't see this place lasting the competitive Santa Barbara restaurant market long.  The food is low quality, the cost is high. I had scallops that looked and tasted like poker chips.  Notice that the positive reviews are about the half price lunch sushi, or they were treated nicely at the door. I can't help but to wonder how 5 stars is warranted because someone said hello.  The Groupon is a scam, as mentioned in other yelp posts.  Pay $36.50 for a $35 discount--REALLY?"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This is the second time I have been here. The first time was three years ago. I remember the food getting really cold before I really had a chance to eat since I was watching the chef cook. I guess I just thought it was because our table was by the door. 
So after three years I went back because a friend was visiting. The chef was pretty cool and the food was pretty good except for the bean sprouts. It was like flavor-less. The waitress forgot our white rice so even after all the food was cooked I was just sitting there asking where the hell is the rice. My friend had to ask the chef and the other people that was sitting with us were kind of pissed too. The chef had to ask the waitress for our rice. So that kind of sucked.
Benihana is way better. The soup at benihanas is def more delicious because here at Something's Fishy they pretty much just give you miso soup. Food is alright but you would get more at benihanas."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I was very happy with my visit to Something's Fishy ! The service was excellent and they answered all of our questions. Came on a Thursday and I must say that the prices were unbeatable. Sunday-Thursday happens to be half off sushi ! I paid $19.00 for 3 sushi rolls, the most delicious fried rice, and 2 sodas. The sushi was really good, and it was a cozy little spot on State Street. Came for lunch, but I heard that dinner is also really good as well."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Consistently throughout the years quality fresh food prepared by experts. Delicious, entertaining, and dis I mention it tastes good? Try the scallops!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Food was extremely enjoyable, ambience of the restaurant was great. The salmon roll felt a bit fishy, but otherwise all the other rolls were great quality."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This place is awesome! The food is great and the service is excellent! I just had dinner with my family and extended family as soon as we arrived had great welcoming our server Cassandra was so nice and sweet did such a good job taking care of us and our children she was very attentive to what we needed and made us feel comfortable. Everyone was great!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Use to go here all the time in college for the sushi specials and it was great. Came back after 3 years and it has gone downhill. The new sushi chefs are not as good and not as sociable.  The hibachi made me sick because the food wasn't cooked all the way. The steak had no flavor and the rice was way too salty. On top of that I was charged 3 times was I should have paid! I called to try to resolve the situation the the female manager was super rude. Not helpful at all and did not apologize. Be careful in the future because aparently if you split the check they charge one of the cards full price and then void it (they don't tell customers this). However, in my case the transaction was not voided and I was charged the full amount while my other two friends were charged the correct amount. I will not be going back."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I ordered menu of Hawaiian poke salad. 
It is many seafoods in with tuna and seaweed salad. It was a delicious. 
Hibachi steak of the chef made the best of taste for grilled rice and beef steak. 
I saw New menu. Seafood rolled sushi wrapped in soy paper is recommend. 
Costumer service is a very very good."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Quality has gone down over the years.  Service was bad, too.  The chef did not say a word.  Plus, the chef was wearing a headband with Japanese word ""Japan [Ni-Pon]"" upside down.  No one understands Japanese at this ""Japanese"" restaurant?  Unfortunately, this is the only Tepan-yaki style restaurant in Santa Barbara, I think."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,Despite seeing all the other reviews that say this place isn't good I decided to give it a shot anyway. The food was very bland and the service was terrible. Everyone there is rude and they don't care about you. It took a long time for everything and our chef didn't do any tricks and he didn't talk to us. Would not recommend this place very bad save your money.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We sat at one of then hibachi areas with our group of 7.   5 of us ordered the hibachi and shared, it was nice.  We had the shrimp dinner, the chicken, the lobster & filet,  etc.  We also had a round of sake bombs.  Most excellent.  It was a fun experience and the food was good.   
       It was Saturday evening, we had a reservation for a little before 7pm.  It took maybe 5-10 minutes to be seated, not too bad.  You cannot go there and expect to be in and out fast, it is entertainment and takes awhile.  I'd say by 830/845 we were just working on our soup and salad (comes with some of the dinners).   Our final bill was over 100$, but reasonable for group size and items ordered.  Delicious.  Could be the alcohol speaking, but I don't think so."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I see a lot of reviews about the size of the place, I actually felt it was large for a sushi place. I guess I'm used to the small sushi bars that are in the Valley...Anyways walking in, I noticed that the inside had a semi-fancy dim lit ambiance.

In terms of service: Our waitress was very nice,polite, and helpful. 

Food: We decided to indulge in the half-price menu: I had an eel& cucumber roll and a crab roll. I'm not so sure that the crab roll had crab or krab, kinda sketch. I liked the eel roll but they went skimpy on the eel sauce (which is my fav). To be honest, the sushi seemed a bit dry and not too authentic (almost like those prepackaged ones you find at albertsons).

My friend had the 'Something's Fishy roll"" which tastiness gave me some hope

I'll probably visit here again for the experience and maybe some pre-drinking munchies before hitting Sandbar ;)."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"My wife and I were desperately looking for ayce sushi in
Santa Barbara. We found this place and really enjoyed it. The sushi is good we give it a 3 out of 5... The ambience was nice it has a great feel to it. Drinks were reasonably priced for sb. Service was ok nothing special. overall it's well worth it to make this a staple eatery of state street for us."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The sushi is just ok. They slice them way to thick and none of the 7 rolls we ordered stayed together.
*** this is an update. I changed from 3 starts to 1 star. I am thoroughly disgusted with this place. Great location and nice staff but food and even the water was gross."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We love and enjoy to eat here. The hibachi grill is alway great and less greasy. Love their half price special on Sushi items from Mon to Thu. The only things that bother us that the waitstaff kinda in a rush to take order without giving us minute to read at the menu or giving us any recommend on their specialty. This time, I have to mention to the waitress that she forgot  to put our drink order on the bill as well as our appetizer.  We almost got a free meal and free drink just right there."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Well..... I've been to the one in woodland hills often. Not at all the same. They obviously cater to the tourist trade and group on. 
Went last weekend.
Couldnt tell if it was open or not. The shades were drawn. 
Awkward check in with the host. 
Made us wait but sat other people who came in. 
Its a bad knock off of Benihana, onion volcano etc. Without the charm. 
They sat us with some weird German tourists. They did not want us there. We did not want to be there either. Their kids were annoying BTW. 
The chef was good and explained everything. The food itself was decent. Ordered the albacore roll. That was the hit. 
Oh, there was no music either so it was extra super awkward because of that. 
Next time in SB will go to Joe's."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Something's fishy pretty much sums up their sushi.  

The place is already pricey, but last time I went there they charged my credit card twice and I had to come back to the restaurant 2 times in order to get it corrected."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"As usual, I was not disappointed. Either sitting at the grill for a show or eating with friends at the bar, I love this place!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Went for lunch. Half price rolls was great, so I am almost willing to overlook the Horrible service we recieved. The waitress realized that she overlooked us at the bar, so she sent the bus boy. He was basically our server. I made sure he got the tip. :) I do wish the guys making the rolls would engage us in conversation more then themselves in Spanish. That was kind of a bummer too. I will still go back because the sushi was cheap and yummy!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is my favorite restaurant. You can enjoy not only the delicious food but fire cooking at your table. The portion was really big, so my girl friend and I shared one dish at lunch but it really worked. Thinking of this, the price is really good!! You can enjoy both meat and seafood. Fried rice is also delicious. I'll definitely come back."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Best sushi in Santa Barbara.  Great to dine in or take out.  I would highly recommend going here.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We love this place, great prices and the cooks are amazing specially Sanson a great chef. Service a little slow but the cooks are always trying to get us what we need. They deserved a better tip!!! 
TIP your cook!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,They definitely treat birthdays different. Should have think twice ok singing happy birthday to someone and not to another person. Lol
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Rolls were decent, but the fish was not very fresh. I was quite disappointed being that we are right by the water. Overall you get what you pay for, they had lots of deals to bring people in, the rolls are cheap - but if you are a sushi snob you will be very disappointed."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This was my first and LAST time eating at this place.

The food was okay, but certainly nothing special. You can most certainly find better Hibachi elsewhere in SB. Not only was our steak over cooked, but our shrimp was rubbery. Likewise, the service here is absolutely horrendous. Part of our order was forgotten about (it wasn't even busy) and the server (Megan) had a ""Don't bother me"" attitude throughout our entire dinning experience. Looking around, I noticed the staff was busy fraternizing with each other with little actual attention being paid to the customer (I guess it's the theme of this place). At the end of our meal, we had to sit even longer for our server to bring the check while she sat up against the wall and looking around aimlessly. 

Do yourself a favor and don't even bother with this place.  I will not be back.

UPDATE: When leaving the restaurant, I unknowingly left a recent purchase behind on my table. I go back into the restaurant only to be greeted by our Server (Megan) who gave me the most UNBELIEVABLE attitude ever. The busser found my package and gave it to me with a smile. What a different a simple gesture could make! Megan should take some serious notes from that guy (as well as the management team). Still won't be coming back to this place."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"we love Something's Fishy !!! service ever!!!! great Jalapeño Bombs!  
awesome tender New York Steak!!! best ramen in town!!!
like i said...love love love  love it  !!!!!!
definitely i will be back !!!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"GROSS. The name of the restaurant says it all- SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY FISHY at this restaurant.

Why aren't there Japanese (or at least asian) chefs behind the counter? The fish (sashimi) reeks of oldness, and you would think everything would be fresh since they're literally a ten minute walk from the ocean.

Steak was overcooked in the hands of a mediocre cook. Reinforces the fact the Bennihanna's is boss. Did no cool magic tricks, onion volcano, or even musical utensil show, I mean COME ON! Everyone knows your paying 40 dollars a dish for the show. 

Santa Barbara is depressing me with their claimed 'Japanese' cuisine. 2 stars because 1) they're on State Street and 2) cause their food is edible."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"After a long day of wine tasting in Los Olivos I decided that we'd do dinner in Downtown Santa Barbara before the long drive home. After walking up and down State St. looking at all the dining options we finally settled on Something's Fishy after I gave up my bid for the Italian restaurant across  the street. 
This place is a teppan and sushi restaurant, sort of in the vein of Benihana. The atmosphere is much more casual and the prices are a bit more affordable. We sat at a communal grill table with two other couples and awaited the arrival of the teppan chef and the server. The service was speedy and accurate and the chef was a jovial cool guy, flipping the shrimp tails into his hat and making jokes. We ordered fried rice with no egg, which had to be prepared in the kitchen in back which I thought as unusual. The rice was way over salted. The chicken and steak were both delicious but my boyfriend didn't care for the shrimp he ordered. I felt in the end that I would've preferred the Italian place that I was originally interested in. No one can really compare to Benihana, bottom line."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Best sushi in Santa Barbara!! I recommend sitting at the sushi bar near chef Hiro. Every time I go there I tell him what I'm in the mood for whether it's veggie or fish or whatever and he makes me something delicious every time. They have good pitcher prices for beer and good wine as well.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"TEPPAN ONLY REVIEW:

Arrived at 7 PM on Saturday with no reservations and was seated within 15 minutes by the nice host. Me and my girlfriend both got the Somethings Fishy Gourmet Dinner me getting Salmon and her Scallops along with our Filet Mignons

First we were served our appetizers of Salad and Miso Soup, the salad had a nice homemade dressing that complimented the lettuce. The soup was just alright though. Next the Chef came out and began the show.

Of course if you've been to teppan before you've seen all the tricks and but its still nice nonetheless. Our food was delicious the scallops and filet mignon were perfectly cooked to medium rare like we requested. The salmon was a bit overdone but it was still tasty. The fried rice is to die for, the teppan nicely brings out the savoriness and cannot be replicated in your kitchen home due to the heat needed. 

Overall food was great, service was attentive, would come back"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Went from being regulars from once to twice a week here to not going anymore. Despite being regulars, service from the wait staff was ALWAYS poor. The sushi chefs were always on top of it however, so hats off to you guys. Food quality constantly changed. Sometimes it would taste good, other times it would taste bland. Food prepared in the kitchen often tasted frozen, dry, and fried rice was clearly made in bulk, reheated and served. To top it all off, I discovered roaches crawling around one night, and ever since this place has been off limits for me."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Best hibachi and sushi in town! The sushi is half price all day every day so super affordable. If you want a fun family dinner or dinner party I highly recommend the hibachi tables! The chefs put on a great show and the food is amazing!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I enjoyed the vibe here. The salmon skin salad was good as was the baked dynamite with scallops. We sat at the sushi bar and order sake with beers. we bought beers for the chefs and they in-turn made us some cool dishes to sample.

We weren't too happy about the drunk guys hitting on us though. Drag...."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Food took too long to cook, and it was probably one of the hottest days in Santa Barbara. The restaurant had the door open, no central air. We were sweating the entire time, couldn't enjoy our meal."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"If you like Benihana, then you will like the Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar in Santa Barbara. The food is great, and great customer service. This is a perfect place for families, and even dates. If you are not familiar with this form of dining...they cook the food in front of you. It is very entertaining and is a pleasure to watch. The only downside is you have to sit right next to others in a bar-like table fashion, and you can sometimes feel a little claustrophobic. If you do not like sitting next to people you don't know, then this place may not be for you. 

Being that Hibachi Steak House is located on the busy State Street, parking may be a challenge. I suggest parking in a nearby parking structure, such as Paseo Nuevo, which is located a few blocks up State Street."

The manager today was really nice making sure we had what we need."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"if you're in Santa Barbara this place is a must!!! Family friendly, entertaining, tasty! Great team work and sushi bar is so perfect for when in a rush. The hibachi dinners are standard price & always love how the cooks perform for your dinner! This place is always a convenient ""go-to"" spot!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Had the steak hibachi dinner, medium rare, and the meat was a little subpar. It was tough and chewy.

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Drove up to SB for New Years Day and while walking State St looking for a good lunch place, decided to stop.  Glad we did!  Friendly greeting, immediately sat at a grill, and ordered appetizers, wine and our hibachi lunches.  The shumai and cucumber salad were delicious!  Then the chef came out and made us a salmon fried rice and a steak, scallop, shrimp lunch special.  Everything was perfect!  We'll be back!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I went to UCSB for college and used to come here in my college days to take advantage of the AYCE sushi deal. Apparently, this place has always had Teppan tables? I must've had blinders on because I always thought they only served sushi. 

Coming back for my brother's wedding was the perfect excuse to come a day early and revisit my old stomping grounds. My friends and family decided to go out drinking on state street and we always came to somethings fishy (what it was called back then) to get the night started with some sake bombs. The staff was super friendly and the management was very nice to let us come in and be obnoxiously loud 10 minutes before closing. They even rushed in our sushi orders! 

Overall I had a great time and I have decided that whenever I'm in Santa Barbara, I need to come back."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This restaurant is okay, and considering it's the only Hibachi place in town we keep ending up there... but I've been to much better.  Wish we had more options in SB."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,I love that they have 1/2 price sushi everyday now. This makes it so much cheaper than other sushi restaurants. The Sushi is also very good as well. Service was good the waiter who took are check at the end was very friendly. I'll defiantly be back for some 1/2 off sushi!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I went to Something's Fishy for the first time with some friends and it was great! We went on a thursday afternoon and the 1/2 off the regular price certainly drew us in. The place was a bit empty when we arrived and we were given small menus that we could write down the amount we wanted for whichever dish. Most dished ranged from 2-3 dollars (except for some specialty rolls) and it was pretty good sushi. The one thing that kept me from rating 5 stars was that I wrote down one order for egg cake and I never got it. Instead I was given the order that was listed above the egg cakes, the mackerel.  The mackerel was good but the chef didn't say anything about changing my order. I could have been allergic to mackerel. The chefs also spoke very quickly that I didn't comprehend what he was giving me. 
I would go back but only on the half off days if I go back to Santa Barbara."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"One of my favorite places to eat here in SB. As a college student, one thing I love more than the food are the affordable prices! I have come here for three years and have been impressed and satisfied after each visit!! My favorite dishes include the SB cut roll, the BSC roll, and the seaweed salad. Friendly wait staff and cheerful sushi chefs behind the bar:)"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I came up to Santa Barbara for a day trip and decided to visit my old favorite spots. It was previously called ""Somethings Fishy"" back in my college years and my friends and I would get the AYCE sushi and see who could eat the most with the loser paying for all of our dinners. I won (obviously) capping out at 6 rolls. 

It was nice to see that the structure and overall vibe of the restaurant has stayed the same with a couple exceptions: they upgraded the tables (better for banging along to sake bombs). Coming back here was a ratatouille moment where I got transported back to much simpler and great times. The food was still good and I left feeling stuffed, as usual. It felt great to come back."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Ordered a shrimp tempura and California roll to-go, and it was a very reasonable price! The portion was a good price for the amount of sushi pieces per roll. The rolls were ready in about 20 minutes during fiesta weekend so I was thrilled with the quick service."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Just awesome place in Santa Barbara.  
I strongly recommend roll and sashimi.  
Great atmosphere and great location ! Employees were nice to us!!! Oishii"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Things I like about Something's Fishy: Half-price sushi on Weekdays. 
Early Bird Special for Teppanyaki (before 6 PM) - save $10 per person at least. 

Things I don't like: Sushi is not that great, but you get what you pay for I guess. 

My recommendation is to get there at like 10 til 6 so you get the Early Bird Special, and do the teppan. It's a good deal, and it's hard to go wrong with the food/entertainment combo. 

For sushi, unless you're broke and don't care about the quality of your sushi, skip it. Edomasa is definitely a better choice and the atmosphere is just as fun (minus the state street crowds)."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Poor quality. Overpriced. Tasteless food.

Just say syinara to this joint. Something fishy is right."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is where I had my 1st and only Sake Bombs!  Something's Fishy is an awesome Hibachi Grill and sushi place in one of my favorite city, Santa Barbara.

The chefs are super cool and the people that eat here are there to have fun too.  The food is really but it's hard to mess up Hibachi food since it's all cooked in butter and most places like this are usually same tasting.

I didn't try the sushi and I wish I did.  This place is slightly pricey but any place with a chef putting on a show at your table are little bit expensive.

I like the location of this restaurant as well.  If you never tried Sake Bombs, ask the waitstaff about it and get one for the whole group.  It's fun to drink!  I miss Something's Fishy!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"One of my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara! Not only do they have mouthwatering (and not to mention inexpensive) sushi, but also delicious hibachi meals! The chefs do a great job at cooking in front of you and it's fun for the whole family! 
Would definitely recommend trying the filet mignon, very tender and flavorful!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Ok, first things first...the food was pretty good.  We came in with a party of 8...4 adults and 4 kids...and everyone was satisfied with their tasty hibachi meals. I'm giving Something's Fishy 2 stars, mainly for their service...which was horrendous.  We came in for dinner this past Monday night at 6pm, and we're pleasantly surprised to see that the restaurant wasn't too busy since we were all very hungry.  Actually only 2 other hibachi tables (out of over 8-9) had occupants prior to us sitting down, however, we didn't end up ordering until 6:50...for reasons I still can't quite comprehend.  With 4 kids (one being a pre-toddler), the speed at which dinners out flow is of utmost importance for larger families, and Something's Fishy sure took their sweet time in that department.  

C'mon Something's Fishy...you're better than this."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Kimberly Cameron, Valencia, CA
I'm really surprised that Something's Fishy only got an overall 3/5 star rating. I love this place!! The Hibachi is excellent, and I've always enjoyed the sushi too!! My favorite Hibachi meal: Scallops and Rib Eye, and I love the salad, fried rice, soup, and veggies!! We go here all the time for birthdays and other special occasions. It really is a treat!! And it's a lot of fun to indulge in a couple sake bombs. Expect to spend some money, but you won't regret it considering how delicious the foods is!"

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This place used to be called ""somethings fishy"" with decent sushi and hibachi, however they have changed their name and raise their prices. They used to have ""half-price sushi"" with good to mediocre quality sushi, 

But recently they have raise their prices, and not raise the quality of their sushi. I would not go here based on the price! I would go to a higher quality sushi place, that has better sushi for the same prices. 
I just got yellowtail sushi and the pieces of sushi are half the size they used to be and almost twice the price.  Whoever made this decision, made a mistake. This used to be my go to place and will not be again because of this"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This restaurant is still worth a visit if you have never been to a hibachi restaurant and don't plan on going to one outside of Santa Barbara ( but you definitely should!).

Hibachi restaurants are places where a chef comes to your table and cooks your food in front of you. What makes it more exciting are the tricks and interaction the chef may have with you. Some tricks you can search up are, juggling an egg on their spatula and cracking it with the edge. Throwing a spatula, flipping shrimp into customers' mouths. On top of all this, the chef is generally happy, cracking jokes, like a performer on stage. 

The problem with this restaurant is every time I go here, I get the same chef and he says hello and cooks the food. He lights some onions on fire later on in the performance and he taps his spatula but that's about all he does. He honestly doesn't look happy being there, and I completely understand.

The food itself, is okay and the servers are excellent. I think the prices here are fair and I usually add a little extra tip, we all gotta make a living.
If you've never been to a hibachi restaurant, this environment can still be quite entertaining. If you've been to other hibachi restaurants already, this place will most likely pale in comparison."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"So, I've been here at least 20 times in the last 15 years.
My kids, nieces and nephews love having "" dinner and a show"".
However tonight  was an all time low. I'm not sure if it's been since they changed their name from something's fishy to hibachi steak house or if management has changed but the last few times we have gone has been worse and worse. 
Tonight  started well, we all got seated got drinks and ordered but the hostess forgot to turn on the grill.
No big deal,  they offered us free appetizers and drinks on the house. Cool, we'll wait..
But the fact that it takes 15 -20 minutes to heat up the grill ( not the chef's fault entirely) they were back in 5 minutes and started cooking. We had a party of 10 and both chefs have been there for many years. 
They started doing the volcano onion and it was barely hot enough to flame at all, then they gave my sister my wife's rare steak then took it back and re fired it.
My wife's rare steak was given to her cold/ blue. my nephew got my niece's filet mignon and they said it was new York strip,
The vegetables were just boiling in their own juice and became spongy and inedible. 
I get and understand that it was Friday night and it was going to be busy but we all would have been much happier to hang out an chat for 10 minutes more when you are paying over $300.00 for dinner and half of it is inedible 
It's a shame they have a spot on the corner of state and haley that will always have downtown traffic and quality doesn't seem to matter anymore .
That will be the last time I ever go there."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Absolutely love the food here, the customer service is the best as well! I came here the other day, and they would check up on us every 5 minutes, they make sure you get what you want! Our waiters name was Omar, he was excellent, he made me feel really comfortable and it just felt as if I've known him for so long! They don't open till 5:30 p.m. but it's worth the wait, they're seriously the only place Ill get sushi from! I got a crunchy roll, spicy edamame, and chicken stir fried rice and it was the best!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Honestly I was a little disappointed.  I don't like sushi so I can't speak to that. But I love tapanyaki style Japanese cooking and this was not great.  I don't know if we had a newer chef,  but the rice was very bland and he didn't tell a single joke! No onion volcano,  no choo choo!  I will try again because I have to believe they can do better than that.

Edit: Came back a few times. Worst hibachi I've ever had. Fried rice is...okay..."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Came here because we had a 10% off coupon. Arrived to find the place practically empty.  Ordered off the lunch menu.  Got the steak and shrimp along with some sushi.  I won't say it was bad, but I've had a lot better. I would look for another establishment unless this was the only choice."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Terrible!!! Called to make a reservation when they opened from two restaurants down .... They said ""come walk down no one is here""

The quality of the sushi is a little above average but still a great deal. If sushi is what you're only ordering, you have to wait for the sushi bar to be available for seating. 

And they do take reservations so don't be afraid to call ahead :)"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is the place. Whatever you had previously planned for dinner, do yourself the favor of the century and come to this place instead. Let me give you a taste of what kind of experience you're in for. The sushi, amazingly fresh and flavorful. The hibachi, mind-blowing yummy. The service, eerily impressive. I have had the pleasure of dining at this establishment dozens of times and not a single time have I been disappointed.  My only regret at this very moment is that I don't have the opportunity to come to this restaurant because right now I'm stuck in Indiana."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Last night my partner and I were really craving sushi and of course it was a no brainier, this place has half priced sushi rolls and we've always loved going. We haven't really gone out to since this whole COVID 19 pandemic started and my girlfriend recently got surgery and last night she was finally up for going out to get some food so it was supposed to be a nice dinner date. Upon arriving I could tell they were on the busier side of most places around. There was a table right in front of the restaurant but we requested something by the heaters since it was starting to get a bit cold. The only table available by a heater seated 6. We confirmed it wouldn't be a problem since it was just my partner and I. We were reassured it would be no problem. So we sat down and looked up the online menu and started to decide what we would order. We then noticed a few people on staff kept walking around looking at us. It happened a few times. We started to feel weird thinking it was because there was just two of us sitting at this 6 people table. Turns out we were right. There was a group of 3 that they wanted to seat but options were limited. We got asked if it would be a problem if we moved, we agreed as long as it was near a heater and they said they had a table clearing up near one. Then a few minutes later the same guy came and said it wasn't a problem we could stay where we were. We asked if they were sure, we didn't have a problem moving but were once again reassured it was fine. We then noticed the group of 3 must work there or be friend of the staff because they were quickly brought a table out from inside and their drink order was taken. By this time it had been 30 or so minutes and the only time we were approached was to be asked to move. We waited a few more minutes and no one came. We noticed the groups of 3 was already ordering and we hadn't even had water brought out. We flagged down a waiter and expressed our frustration. He said he would be back and after another 5 minutes we decided to get up and leave. Worst experience ever."

A must order was the yellow tail carpaccio with black peppercorns!! We all did the hibachi, our chef Francisco was amazing and so fun.

Both affordable, both good. Same applies for university students. Everything about this place caters to anyone that just wants a nice and satisfying break from the real world that is work."

The chicken was marinated perfectly.  The white sauce was great,  but the brown sauce was not the typical and was just teriyaki sauce. Great time!"

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Based on food and service this place is a 2, but because I've created so many sloshy memories here, it's gotta get an extra star.  

Everytime we came out of this joint our whole party would be smashed. My college friend used to work here so she'd hook us up with free food and sake from our teppenyaki chef.  The best memory I  can remember is doing sake bombs and then offering our chef to partake with us. And because I have a fondness for fire, I would always convince our chef to perform the onion volcano atleast twice. FIRE!!

The food isn't all that great, come to think of it, towards the end of the meal I wouldn't even remember how my food tasted. The best part about the meal is the leftovers i would find in the fridge the hungover the morning after.  

I've also tried the ""all you can eat sushi"" at the counter, which was a complete mistake. The sushi was horrible. All filla and no thrilla. If I left even 1 kernel of rice on my plate the sushi chef wouln't make another roll until it was finished. I ended up having to hide 2 fistfuls of sushi rice underneath my plate.

If you're lookin for good japanese food/sushi DO NOT come to here, but if you're looking for a good time with your friends/family, this is the place. And if he still works there, request Carlos for your chef."

It gets busy during dinner time so expect to wait a little -- but it's totally worth it. The ""Santa Barbara Roll"" is delicious!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"My husband and I came here on 1/28/20 to celebrate our anniversary. We are now at our Air BnB swapping toilet time and feeling sick to our stomachs. We each had steak and seafood. We asked for GF for my husband and the chef put soy sauce on my husband's food. BTW, celiacs can't have soy. Our waitress knew, but the chef didn't understand... ‍‍

Now our toilet has enjoyed our $100 dinner. 

Cool atmosphere.  Really kind and attentive staff."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"We are new to Santa Barbara and wanted to try the local sushi on State street. We actually attempted to call before walking 25 minutes to this location to which they didn't answer their phones on the two attempts of calling. 

This was for my wife's and best friend's birthday; and we had a party of ten. When we arrived, they told us they would have to seat us at two tables of five, possibly separated, and that there would be a 15 minute wait. After waiting well past 20 minutes, a seated customer they over served alcohol to vomited on the floor under her table. After 5 minutes of scrambling their workers to address that mess, they walked up to us and tell us they won't be able to seat us Because, ""It will overwhelm their servers.""

We were ready to indulge, pay good money for drinks and food, they made us excessively wait and turned our business down. Absolutely haphazard of the staff and a terrible experience for us."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Cheap, fun atmosphere, subpar service, and loud people taking saki bombs. Good place to go if your looking for decent food and a relatively low bill. Embrace the rest."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,This place place used to be great. The ginger is too warm for taste and enjoyment. I probably will still come back for the prices. Never gotten sick. Always moderately fresh and enjoyable.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Awesome hospitality and entertainment when it comes to the hibachi side. And great service. Sushi is delicious, place is clean and great sushi chefs. Everything was excellent. I always get sushi here and don't break my bank in order to do so. Flavorful yummy food that isn't only limited to sushi but also the hibachi side that has tons of meat options that are cooked beautifully."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I will start positive: ice tea was awesome. Done. Between the waiter consistently banging into the back of my chair as he passed and the lack luster hibachi ""chef"" who under cooked everything and seemed annoyed when I ask him to cook the scallops more after he slipped them on my plate, and the tuna ""carpaccio"" ( cut as thick as a pancake), I would say that it made the $104 bill sooooo not worth it.  I had to apologized to my friend who had never been to a hibachi grill and I talked it up to him.  Oh, another positive thing: the bill came fast!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"If I could write ZERO stars I would. Miguel the ""Manager"" has to be the most unprofessional person I've spoken to over the phone AND in person. I called to make an order for pickup and was placed on hold for over 10-15 minutes hung up on several times, and when I finally got through, again I was told my order would take OVER 25 minutes. I let him know he had hung up on me and placed me on hold and with an attitude said, ""It'll be 25 minutes"". I told him I had been on hold and hung up on, and if there was any way it could be sooner than 25 minutes and he said, ""No."" I told him I was going to write a poor yelp review about the instance and I asked for his name and CLICK, hung up on me. Lucky for him, I was down the street and walked over and asked at the hostess stand what his name was, and he said ""Miguel"" I asked for the ""manager"" and he said he was the manager. I let him know that he had POOR customer service. I told him I had just called and he placed me on hold and hung up on me, and he said, ""fine write your yelp"" so HERE I AM. Don't waste your time or money on this place when management is a JOKE, and wont respect the customer. All it took was a simple, ""I'm sorry, we are backed up and can't fulfill to-go orders. Miguel, you have plenty of growing and learning to earn as a ""manager"" because with that Piss-poor attitude, you won't grow this business."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I've been here many times over the years and although it would never be my first choice for sushi, it's still pretty decent. The rolls are basic and the fish quality is about average. I'd definitely say that the sushi aspect of this place is much better then the grilled food. If you want to go with a group, it has a fun atmosphere at night, but the best time to go is for lunch on Thursdays for 1/2 priced sushi. THAT is well worth it. Great location too."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"While I'm sitting at the restaurant, I wonder why exactly it takes an hour for my sushi to come to me. Sure, it's 4 dollars, but that doesn't compensate for the fact I had to ask for it four times. It's consuming my entire night to eat this meal. I'm sitting here, starving, and it will probably be another hour until the hibachi chef gets to me. 

A tip from to the owners- make sure your food can be served in a timely manner so yelpers don't write cranky reviews when their blood sugar is low and they are starving."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Disappointed in the food. We got the hibachi scallops. They were rubbery and tasteless. The ""shrimp flambe"" was three tiny, forlorn shrimp with no flavor. Plating was inelegant. Sushi was ok"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Wow, what a pleasant surprise! I've walked past this place many times, and had no idea what a pleasure it would be. The sashimi was fresh. The rolls were creative and equally tasty. I'll be back to try the hibachi, but I recommend the sushi for its great taste and price."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This has gotta be the best happy hour sushi ever. Usually a wait but defiantly worth it. If you need a quick meal, visit this spot its really good and quick!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This is a great place... love the hibachi.  The food is so great - everything is delicious.  We love the service too!!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,We ordered two rolls from Hibachi -BSC roll and a crunchy roll and it took over an hour to get the rolls. Mind you this was to go so it's understandable if it takes longer but an HOUR?! Finally I told the front host that it's been an hour and she said it was ready. Mind you I've been standing right next to her (why didn't she tell me?) we opened the foam boxes and the food was cold! Don't recommend- you're better off going to Ralphs and grabbing sushi there.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Hibachi Steak House and Sushi Bar is located in 502 State Street in Santa Barbara.

Let me start off by saying that although the service is not super fast, the waitress made sure that we had everything that we needed, from drinks to side dishes, as we waited comfortably at our table. Once our cook arrived, he was professional and prepared our meal right before our eyes, much to our delight. He also named and explained the usage for each sauce, which was a nice gesture on his part.

Hibachi is an experience that cannot soon be forgotten. I'll definitely be visiting this establishment again in the near future."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"During non-COVID times this is the only place in town to get Hibachi. However, we regularly make our way here for the sushi. They have a great selection of rolls and the prices are very reasonable. I prefer the big foot roll, unless I'm feeling something simpler, in which case I'll double up in the Santa Barbara and Something's Fishy rolls - in case you're wondering, this spot used to be named Something's Fishy for many years. 

They have some outside seating and rumor is they'll be building a parklet soon. Perhaps the best thing about the place is their incredibly friendly service. Head sushi chef Hiro is a particularly fantastic guy and I have never had a poor experience here. With the outside seating, and their prime location on the best block in town for fun, it's a great spot to people watch and enjoy a meal."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"My roommate and I love this place- we've tried other places in Santa Barbara but we always end up coming back here. The staff has always been friendly and most of them recognize us at this point. Shout-out to Chef George- he always makes sure to come chat with us, even if it's just for a bit and it makes us feel very welcome. 
Our favorites include the Santa Barbara, Tokyo, Fire and Philly roll. Honestly, between the low prices, cheerful staff and the yummy sushi, this place is hard to beat in our books."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Best Hibachi I've ever been to. Staff was super friendly, the food quality was excellent. Most of these places offer either a basic steak option or filet but you can also get NY strip and ribeye here and the quality difference is very evident. Onion volcano was tops."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Yelpers! This review is on the Teppanyaki part of the restaurant. 

We made reservations because we had a Groupon for a dinner for four. We get there only wait a few minutes which wasn't bad. We are called to be seated and the waitress was not bad but she was not great either. She would later tell us that she was still new but the excitement and wanting to take care of us was not there from the start. 

Jose our chef was really great he didn't talk that much but put on a great show and made sure we liked the food and wanted us to have a great experience. He did five star work that is for sure.

The rice was not to shabby, the chicken and streak were good. It just is not better than other Teppanyaki places we have tried. 

Once the check came it was not processed correctly and it was 2/3 more than it should have been. Our server did not fix it she had someone else do it. 

We were disappointed especially it being a family dinner. The price point I would say is better than other places but will probably just go to another place next time."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Decent portions, great prices (during 1/2 off), and very tasty sushi. LOVE IT!!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Yes! I dare you to order the filet and report back here. Because if you actually believe you've been served a filet, then it's been a long time since you've had a filet. What they actually serve is some other type of ""meat product"" that isn't a filet. Trust me, I'm not being a snob, because they'll even admit that it was a ""mistake"" if you say something. 

Hmm. 

This happened twice out of the two times we went. If you are wondering why we would revisit, it's because they will ""save face"" and recook you an actual filet in the kitchen but it seems like if they can get away with it, they will try. 

Just sayin."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The happy hour sushi here is amazing! The half off rolls and sushi are both fresh and delicious. The chefs are really friendly and take time to make sure the order is right as well as make conversation. There are a lot of seats at the sushi bar, but most of the times I went there was a wait. If you want sushi, you do have to eat at the bar as there aren't any other tables for that.

This place also doubles as a hibachi restaurant and although I haven't had the opportunity to try this specific one out yet, it always seems full with people and the customers seem happy.

I will definitely be making a trip back when I'm craving sushi, which I always am!

Cheers,
Jess"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I went with my friend to check this place out and it was great! These types of places in my area are usually pretty average, but I really enjoyed this place. I got the rib eye combo and everything was cooked very well. My steak came out medium rare just like I wanted and the fried rice was very flavorful. Also the miso soup with mushrooms is very delcious, they add a nice flavor to it. Would recommend to anyone in the area or willing to drive to SB!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This place is wonderful for a casual dinner. The sushi is good, not great but you get what you pay for.

Don't normally write reviews but I just had to express how much I loved it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Something's fishy here!!  This place is too good, darn it.  Ah the memories.  You can get super wasted, pig out on BOMB Japanese food, and get a show all in one.  Afterwards, you can wander around State.  And it always helps when you're friendly with the servers.  This place has teppan so if you're into fried and flames, check it out.  Definitely a good place for groups.  You can sake bomb until tomorrow and it's all good.  Sometimes it can get kind of crowded, but it's worth checking out atleast once.  Of if you just want to sample the food in peace, the lunch hours are always good and they have specials."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Went to this place during Fiesta, and oh man what a treat it was.

Our chef, Francisco, was a real blast to hang out with. We have been to places like this before, but Francisco really made it special. He was joking around with us and putting a bright smile on our faces.

The food was really tasty too. You guys need to try the fried rice...

Even though this a Hibachi place, the sushi was pretty delicious too. Not only did we get a show, but dinner WAS the show.

Highly recommend this place and ask for Francisco if you can!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I'm shocked at the reviews here.  I love this place.  People try to compare this place to Benihana.  That's so stupid.  This is state street Santa Barbara.  I have so any wonderful memories of this place.  This is where you go to have dinner before you paint state street with your drunken presence.  Sake bombs and fresh sushi, let the teppan chef entertain you while you are slamming back beers in the middle of the best pre party spot in Santa Barbara.  Whether you are a graduating ucsb student, here for Fiesta, or just looking for a fun place to eat with friends, I highly recommend this spot.  Half price sushi, fried rice, and white crack sauce for the seafood.  Hell yeah.  Do not come here expecting some fancy fru fru stuff.  Eat and enjoy the show, remember your night is just getting started, make it one to remember forever..."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,We had an order to go while on a mini vacation trip to Santa Barbara and boy did we get lucky with this place. The hibachi was awesome and the sushi was great. Everything tasted fresh and and cooked to order. Would come back.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Went for the hibachi but started at the sushi bar. The four sushi items I had were tasty and well prepared but they were all a bit too close to room temperature. It seems their sushi prep area isn't cold enough. Not a comforting feeling. Four of us had the hibachi: steak and shrimp, steak only and chicken only. You get three or four shrimp regardless of what you order and roughly twice that if you get the shrimp and steak. Soup was tasty, followed by a nice little salad. However, the comments about the fried rice are true -- the chef sprinkles WAY too much salt on it while its being mixed with the veggies. Most likely it also contains MSG to kick up the flavor. They also drop a generous amount of butter on the steak, chicken and anything that doesn't move. Result: too rich and salty. The yellow squash and bean sprout vegetable side is tasty. Steak is carved up and is tender. The chicken is a very cheap cut of breast, thin, fairly small; not plump at all and more gristle than necessary. The entree prices are fair but the quality of the steak and chicken could definitely be taken up a notch. Everyone commented on how full and bloated they felt after dining. Bottom line: The veggies and meats are heavy, overly salty and not fresh, light and a gourmet experience by any stretch. Its a shame because with a bit more attention and modified cooking techniques this could be a great go to habachi in the heart of the tourist area. Wine by the glass prices are ridiculous, as other reviewers have noted."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"This place used to be called ""somethings fishy"", with decent sushi and hibachi, however they have changed their name and raise their prices. They used to have ""half-price sushi  with good to mediocre quality sushi, But recently they have raise their prices, and not raise the quality of their sushi. I would not go here based on the prices, I would go to a higher quality sushi place, that has better sushi for the same prices. Too bad they raise their prices!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"One of my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara. The food is amazing. I like to go early to beat the crowds. Been going here forever back when it was ""Something's Fishy"". Typically do the hibachi. Always fun watching non-American tourists jolt alarmingly when a group starts a sake bomb."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"We love this place, great prices and the cooks are amazing specially Sanson a great chef. Service a little slow but the cooks are always trying to get us what we need. They deserved a better tip!!!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Food was delicious and in their defense it was cold the day we went, they had heaters that didn't really work and my food got cold before I even finish. Sushi was ok, the ambiance is great because it's outside and you can see all the people. We didn't get the dipping sauces for the dish."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Seating and service were fine. Prices were fine, but not much of a ""bang for your buck"". We weren't too hungry, so it wasn't a big deal, but the sushi rolls were itty bitty. They tasted great, but just wasn't the quantity we were hoping for."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Do not waste your time! We just walked in for lunch on my birthday no less and they had a table for 6 and they had a man and his granddaughter sitting there in the middle and the kid refused to move over and let our party or 4 sit together. So rather than insist, the host said we could wait (they have only one chef available so that would be 30 minutes at least)
Terrible customer service - we will never come back"

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"DISCLAIMER: I haven't been here in a while so things may have changed but this is based on my old experience.

I ordered a standard roll that a lot of people order, nothing special in a sense. They start you off with a lot of appetizers which will basically fill you up before you even begin eating the main course meal. That is probably the only downside but I guess that is Japanese tradition or something like that. 

Otherwise their food is good and their service is average. Kind of a small area and you can just feel others around you. Very dark as well especially at night. I guess that's how the atmosphere is as the name may suggest."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This place was so good to me in college. 

Came here at least once a month on a weekday beacuse Monday through Thur the sushi would be half price.  EVERYTHING on the sushi roll menu was half off.. not just a limited menu like most places. 

I celebrated my 21st bday here and got a table with Tepanyaki- where they entertain you with making the food. That's always fun.  Since its a college town most of the servers were college students and young so when we were doing sake bombs for my bday I asked the server to join in and she happily joined!  Awesome! 

I love the asparagus sushi roll.

Now that I'm more than a couple hundred miles away.. makes me want to make a trip down to SB! 

Oh and you MUST finish your dinner with the Tempura Ice Cream.. deep fried GREEN TEA.  Such a huge portion.  Its to die for!"

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"They were very friendly and apologetic but very obvious short on cooks. We waited 25 minutes to be seated- our choice but once we were seated it was almost an hour before the chef came over. When he came, he was nice but obviously rushed through everything and he was exhausted. There was not an option of chicken breast-it was thighs- I assumed breast. No yum yum sauce- should have asked. Saw reviews used to be good but definitely a downward trend. They were apologetic and offered the table free edamame and California rolls. They tried to make it right but too deep at that point."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"The teppanyaki was a fun experience. It was not much of a show, but still fun to be served food right off the grill in a group before a chef.

For dinner guests select meats that come with vegetables, miso soup, salad, shrimp flambé, and white or fried rice. Three dipping sauces are provided as well. The individual portions are not large, but everything combined is a fairly large meal. 

I had chicken and New York steak.

Shrimp flambé was the first meat to come out. Everyone received three de-shelled, medium sized shrimps. It was lacking in flavor.

The chicken came out dry and not very flavorful. Beware it was all dark meat too if that's not your thing. The steak though was cooked perfectly rare as I requested, tender and juicy. I really enjoyed it.

The manager was very kind and polite from the moment I walked in until I left. I like that he interacted with guests. Also, the chefs stacking the onions to form a flaming volcano were pretty snapchattable. More tricks would be nice.

I recommend the teppan if you live in the area and want to try an interactive dining experience; small parties will be seated with strangers, so it takes a little longer to be seated and to order. It's great for a birthday.

Also, locals tell me this is the place to get sushi on a budget: half off Monday through Thursday."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Came here for my friend's birthday . Everything was great as usual. We got seat right away when we got in. Hero did an awesome job and the waitress was very attentive as well.
Thank you."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,This is the place that taught me about my love for sushi.  I would travel out to Santa Barbara twice a year for a few weeks at a time and I would eat here almost everyday.  I was only like 20 and this place taught me what rolls I liked and didn't like.  Thank you.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The fact that it took 45 minutes for a chef to come to our table was extremely frustrating. However, eventually the chef came and he was really nice and seemed competent. The food was also not bad. The service however was the worst part, took about 20 minutes to get a refill on a water and the whole thing just seemed very disorganized. Another part I found kind of frustrating was the fact that none f the food was introduced so we didn't really have any idea what exactly we were eating.
If you're going for the Groupon meal offer don't expect an actual stake because the portions are going to be a lot smaller than in the pictures. Nevertheless, overall the meal was a lot of food so it did not really matter for me."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Just okay. This place has a weird set up everything is out in the open. They have a good ""lunch box special"". The sushi itself is okay and the service is okay. Nothing too memorable."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Been coming here since I was a kid. I don't go out to eat sushi much, but here I will always order a roll or two whether I'm sitting at the sushi bar or teppan tables. It's just that good. Their mustard sauce in my opinion is the best with steak, ANY steak. I don't use A1 sauce anymore unless I'm at some other American steak house and that's all I'm left with. I guess that's the only downside. You've got a glimpse of something so delicious that everything else will not taste as good."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I have been coming here for awhile now and at first it seemed great. Service from our regular waitress, Jordan was outstanding! The food was delicious and prepared in a timely manner. However, with more visits I frequented, the food was sometimes hit or miss. Some days the food seemed fresh, other times it didn't taste as good. Service has tanked recently from servers, whether it is busy or not. Maybe it's lack of training, or discipline, I'm not sure. Our server would take a long while to get us drinks, requests, and taking our order teppan order when sat at the sushi bar.

Some hosts and hostesses don't always look too happy and don't give a warm welcome. I get it, you might be having a bad day, or you're upset, you're tired, whatever. But personal issues should he pushed aside while you are working and you should try and perform your best. The sushi chefs however are ALWAYS outstanding. They are the ones who have helped me decide to give a higher rating. They are polite, and fast with orders.

Summed up, I would still visit here and keep giving this place a chance. They are not bad, but they are not the best either. Food is a 3/5 and service is a 2/5. I want to see how they can improve because I know they have great potential."

If you're lucky, try to get seated in his area at the sushi bar and ask him to serve one of his off the menu creations! The sushi quality is very good now so enjoy your hibachi and sushi! Can't lose!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I have been coming here for years.  It has changed ownership and names over the years.  I am not sure who is the current ownership but I had a bad experience..  The sushi bar has great deals and customer service.  Today however, I tried to order togo teriyaki dinner and they don't offer it togo so I was offered to order teriyaki chicken for 7.50. So I did.  When I go home it was a packet of mushrooms wrapped in a tiny bit of tin foil so it was difficult to notice any chicken. When I called because I didn't see any chicken,  I spoke with management who was rude and told me his staff did pack the chicken.  This was an embarrassment to their establishment that they would sell this dish.  This was smaller than a salad dressing portion.  Live and learn!  I hope they change management again!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Food was good. State St is closed right at this corner so there is outdoor dining. The wait was not too bad for a Saturday night.  The steak was cooked perfectly. The food did get a little cold, but  the place was super busy and they were doing all they could under the circumstances. The server was polite, she did forget a couple things we had asked for (small things, sauces), but she also mentioned she was new. Def a great place for dinner, we would eat here again."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I've only eaten here for the rolls, and I find it reasonable.  It's a great place to get half off sushi, but not life changing.  Although I do have to say that their featured Homare Strawberry Nigori is something to try.  Not sure if something milky should be combined with fancy rolls, but if you stick to nigiri or sashimi it'll be fine."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Ahhh this place never disappoints I absolutely love the food here. I always order the crunchy roll and Mexican roll. My fave, hibachi anyone? The guys always put a great show. Bring your family here there going to love it."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Manuel the manger is terrible at customer service. He was condescending toward me and was very unprofessional, even laughed at me. A managers job is to be courteous, helpful, service-oriented, this manager is not. Anytime I've ordered through grubhub and there needs to be a price adjustment, the restaurant staff has automatically charged me for this or they have called me to clarify- Manuel did neither. He should learn how to navigate grubhub more efficiently or don't offer grubhub service to customers. Had your menu been accurate, had you offered a side of fried rice instead of just white rice, I would not have been forced to modify my order in the first place. There is an option to upgrade a side of rice if you order a meal, but not just as a side. Manuel told me this was my fault. Congratulations, Hibachi Steak House, because you hired a person who clearly does not exemplify a service-oriented professional, you have lost a very loyal customer of the past 30 years. All he needed to do was at least apologize, instead he laughed at me."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Not a super luxurious place, but a great stop for a quick lunch and dinner. The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is because of the wait staff. Not sure if it's from lack of staff or lack of training, but they always look overwhelmed. One waitress in particular however, asked and gave us our drinks and then never bothered to come back to the bar until we had a busser go fetch her for us. Again, she never came back for refills or to check on us, and the next time we saw her is when we asked for the bill. Unfortunately I did not catch her name, but she tends to talk among her coworkers instead of working, management should get on this. The food is pretty good, the sushi chefs are always polite and on point. I visit here at least once a week, and I can say the sushi itself tastes fresh a majority of the time, and the chicken and beef teriyaki are pretty tasty! The fried rice however is not consistent, sometimes it's not cooked properly or it is overcooked. I still give a 4/5 for the sushi chefs and the food. Please raise the standards on the floor staff, and you guys are solid!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,First time eating here. Called ahead and made a reservation. I recommend doing that as they do get really busy. You can choose if you want sushi or Teppanyaki. We elected for the Teppanyaki and it was delicious! Shared a table with 4 other people. Was a fun experience and was worth the price! I ordered the Hibachi steak and scallops with fried rice. Highly recommend it! Also ordered the hot sake which I also suggest trying!! Give this place a try you won't regret it!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"So disappointing.  Prices were high but I don't mind if the food is awesome. Vegetable dinner plate was bland. Tofu had almost no seasoning. Halibut was expensive and it had been frozen beforehand. It was also not a large piece of halibut, it was small slices. Appetizer of vegetable spring rolls were mediocre and did not arrive until dinner was served. Server never brought out rice that should have been withy dinner. Also, they weren't completely knowledgeable about food content. I asked for no dairy but the salad dressing was a dairy product. I'm used to that and it's okay, not every server understands how important that can be.  It seemed like a great place from the outside but maybe it just looked that way because State St is a touristy attractive place. Next time we will ask around to find out where the locals go."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"FRANCISCO IS THE WORST CHEF EVER! I've been going to Something Fishy for over 10 years now, and conservatively I'd say that I've been there at least 45 times for dinner, likely much more. I've had Francisco at least a dozen times and have ALWAYS hated the finished product, and his personality stinks. If you frequent here like I do, you know that Francisco doesn't do ANY entertainment at all, aside from the brief volcano in the middle. He rushes to cook the food so he can move on to the next table, inevitably to make more in tips, and tonight my husband's chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. Disgusting! After only cooking the rice for approximately 3 min he started spooning it into the bowls to serve it so I kindly asked if he could cook mine a little longer off to the side as he finished cooking the remaining dishes. He was downright rude, and then to make a point he pretty much burnt the rice and refused to cook anything else until my husband finally demanded that he stop trying to burn it and hand it over already! The whole time he was cooking it he had a crappy look on his face and was acting so childish.  What a joke! The rest of my food was hardly cooked and he was incredibly rude the rest of the experience. I will demanded a different chef IF I visit again. He's always been a nightmare of a chef, but tonight he crossed the line. Not to mention that I had my 2 year old daughter with me who adores the fire shows and the tricks with the spatulas, but he didn't do any, and never does. My poor kiddo was so bummed. Why do they keep that guy employed there?! Management, if you are reading this, please monitor his output and offer remedial training! You are losing customers! 
My dinner was horrible tonight, like it is every single time he is the chef. 
Thank God for our waitress who was wonderful! I wish I had caught her name. If it wasn't for her I would have left while Francisco was trying to burn our rice. 
Oh! And to top it off, while in the middle of cooking another chef came over and they took a shot of alcohol while he was (hardly) cooking for us. How unprofessional. This place is becoming a joke. It use to be much better when the original owner, the father of the current owner, was still managing the place. It's falling apart now."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"It was an all around horrible experience. I was there with a group for a birthday party. They sat us 45 minutes late for our reservation and by the time our chefs finally arrived, it was late and they wanted to leave so they rushed through cooking our food and left out all of the tricks and stunts that is part of the whole hibachi experience. What should have been a happy fun filled night was full of frustration. Why rush us when it was their fault we sat late in the first place? I used to love this place before the ownership changed. But I will never be back."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The portion for the price is ridiculous. 

You get more vegetables deep fried than the actual entree."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Over cooked steak that came out cold. Fried rice tasted like it was microwaved. Then to top it off wait staff was rude and inattentive. So not worth the money, better off going to Benihana."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"My friends and I came here for dinner. I found out that 'Something Fishy' had changed their name to 'Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar'. When we arrived here, no one greeted us even though there was a waitress by the door who saw us. The wait wasn't too long since there were seats available. When I saw the menu, I noticed this place raised their sushi price. The food is okay since they're very plain, and the fish doesn't taste fresh. The service was okay since the waiter offered what we needed."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The ginger was dry. Rolls were okay, nothing spectacular. Came during happy hour but of course the specialty rolls are regular price. The experience wasn't good because they had multiple spiders. One was on the (dirty) menu, one came hanging from the ceiling, and one crawled up on the bar. Aside of that I had to swat my plate the whole time because of gnats. They actually landed in my drink and kept trying to attack my food."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Best sushi I have ever had for an unbelievable reasonable price . Jorge made music for our mouths. We are so happy we decided to stop here during our road trip. We will definitely stop here every time we make this trip !
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I understand why people would like the prices here, but they sacrificed all other aspects of a decent restaurant. Including quality of food and especially service. I am allergic to many things and they did not really seem to care or listen when I told them, which made me concerned that there may have been things in the rolls that could have made me very sick. 
When we received our food it seemed as if the sushi chefs have perfected the art of making fresh sushi appear as if it had been made the day before and left to sit under fluorescent lights. When we noticed one roll had a topping on it that was not listed on the menu that I was allergic to, when we alerted the chef they seemed annoyed with us and refused to remake or replace the roll with something else. After this final slight, we asked for all of our uneaten food to be boxed and went to get Italian food up the road. The sushi was later consumed as high munchies, and it still tasted like fishy paste. Something's fishy is right, but not in the way you would like."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I can't comment on the steak or the service, because I only rolls during the Covid 19 panic. The gentleman who took my order was very kind for the brief interaction we had. Given the look of the place, the large amount of workers inside, and the grub hub drivers waiting outside to grab the orders I felt confident the rolls would be good. I didn't bother Yelping. Lesson learned. I ordered the two special rolls for the day, The crunchy roll and the orange fire roll. One was $12 and the other was 14. The ingredients sounded like a good combination, although they touted the Fire roll as being really hot, which is a bonus for my tastes. I brought the rolls home and they were fairly sized so the portion was adequate, but once my family and I actually ate them, disappointment reared it's ugly face. The quality of the ingredients was severely lacking. The crunch roll seemed like they used stale crumbs, the rice was almost doughy, and left your mouth coated with a dry doughy feeling which took from the other ingredients that should have saved the meal. The same issue with the rice went for the fire roll, only it was even more disappointing as it had salmon in the center and a beautiful slice of tuna on top. But looks can be deceiving, the sushi was actually not very fresh and it couldn't save the day, rather it only added to the sad meal. I'm not an avid sushi eater, but I've had it at least a hundred times in my life, and this was easily the worst I've ever had from an actual sushi restaurant (buffets and grocery stores don't count). If you're in the mood for rolls, keep rolling for your own sake."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Love love love this place. We order so many dishes and all of them were so delicious. Service is just amazing. Our server suggest me plum wine which was good. I highly recommend this place.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,Sadly to say my last visit didn't go well. Ordered food that was suppose to be vegan and ended up getting shrimp and i got sick for two days. I decided to come back today. Feb 9th and ordered food that was once again...lined with raw fish. This time I will take some responsibility for it because I didn't speak directly with the chef but with the host who translated my request for FISH free food.
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Just stopped by for a last minute anniversary dinner and everything was so great and yummy! Sushi rolls are good and reasonably priced, NY steak and salmon were so great and juicy! Service was also great, our server was really attentive. Would go back!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Something's Dirty - very dirty, and not very good. I don't know what it was three years ago when I wrote my first review for Something's Fishy -- perhaps I was jaded by my minuscule graduate student budget or maybe the food and atmosphere at Something's Fishy were better back then. Whether the scales have fallen from my eyes or things have taken a turn for the worse, the quality of the food and cleanliness of the restaurant are seriously lacking. 

When we sat down, our countertop was sticky with a what appeared to be weeks of accumulated soy sauce, dust, hair and who knows what else on it. The paper menus had soy sauce spilled on them. The sushi chef was scratching his face and picking at his nose then grabbing a handful of sushi rice to prepare a roll. It just wasn't a good scene. The curtain that you have to walk through to get to the bathrooms looks like you could catch an infectious disease as you pass it - just nasty. 

That said, I loved this place for the half price sushi when I was on a serious budget. These days, I won't be returning. Everything about it repulses me down to the smog ridden ceilings, dingy decor and nasty after taste of the sushi. The customer service is absent-minded and inattentive. However, I understand this can be a decent sushi alternative if you're looking for a bargain and don't mind comprising quality and cleanliness. 50 off sushi all day, every day."

I won't ever be able to eat there again."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I absolutely love this place. I have been a patron for many years and have never had a bad experience.

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This is where you go if you want sushi on the cheap. Quality is basic but ""good."" The teppen is tasty. It's not a gourmet experience but it is edible and reasonably priced Sun - Thurs. The fried rice is fantastic!"
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Service at this place was truly top notch. I mean they didn't rush to be friendly when I walked in but eventually it got better. I guess I'm not too picky! Seriously though the waiter was incredible and obviously local because he seemed to know about everything. I don't think I've had an individual experience with a server in my time in Santa Barbara so this is very refreshing. 

Sushi was good, like good, not unforgettable. The half-off thing helps bring a lot of value to the sushi, you definitely feel like you get your money's worth unlike a lot of sushi restaurants here. 

Bathroom is pretty decent, I don't know why I feel like this should be included but I saw someone else complain about it being dirty. There was a guy doing his hair or something though...strange.

Something's Fishy is really a terrible name in my opinion but the restaurant is good!"

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,Been coming to this place for years with my family. However in the last 2 years its taken a turn for the worse. They have changed their recipes and it is not for the better. I used to come every year for my birthday because I loved the taste of their chicken steak and shrimp but now I choose to go else where. Also the staff used to make be a lot friendlier now seems likely they are more task driven then taking care of their customers
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,My son and I really enjoyed our dinner here! My son compared it to BeniHana but said this place was better and I agree! The price is perfect it not too pricey. My son got the New York steak dinner plate and I got the New you're steak with salmon and the portions were perfect! We also had sushi rolls for our appetizer and those tasted very fresh! I'm very pleased with this spot!  I highly recommend
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Came tonight after purchasing a Groupon, I wasn't sure what to expect as it was my first hibachi style dining experience. I was pleasantly surprised! The service was good and food was very good. We ordered two hibachi steak dinners with scallops and fried soft shell crabs to start and love it all. The only thing was we expected a bit more showmanship from the chef, but he still did a good job. The restaurant itself could go for an update and perhaps a deep cleaning but overall it's a nice dining environment. I would come in again and I recommend giving it a try- especially with the Groupon."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"DON'T EAT HERE The worst hibachi ever!!!! The waitress was so sweet but it was all out of her control. Francisco the chef was terrible...., not a smile,no conversation, no show.  The manager said that's just the way he is, WTF??? Fire him.  I had my food cooked in the back since they couldn't cook without butter.... everything was all over cooked and another lady at the table was the same (cooked with Francisco).  I said I wasn't paying for the cooked items, mind you I had $13 In shitty sashimi.. the waiter had the audacity to say that I ate the shrimp.  Hello, I hadn't eaten since breakfast. The shrimp were over cooked crap. I will never go back there. There are better restaurants around."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Friday is super busy for State Street and while we were asking this place looked pretty good. We were sat pretty quickly but it took a while for our initial service. Service staff was really good and friendly after that. For dinner, I ordered the New York strip steak and shrimp hibachi with fried rice substitution combo (which came with a small salad). Although dinner was good, for the price, I was pretty disappointed with the entire meal including presentation ($30- not including tax or tip). It wasn't your typical fried rice plate (no eggs or veggies other than onion) flavored with salt and pepper), my steak had a ton of fat on it, and the shrimp wasn't flavored well enough."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"We went to this restaurant on 9/1/19. Party of 8. We had a 30 wait time. No problem.

We were seated at the grill and the grill was filthy. While we sat and waited. We saw customers come and go. It was confusing as we had been waiting an hour at this point. I must point out that after the first 15 min of waiting, we got our drinks, then 10 min later we received soup and then salad. As we waited we saw the table at the front window get new customers, meal prepared and saw them leave. Finally we questioned the waitress and she said we would be next. Eventually, our chef came to our grill. I must point out that each station has 2 grills which services 8 customers. Well the chef came and the customers at the grill in front of us within our stink was beginning to get their grill started. I was not happy and got up to find the manager when the chef looked around and turned to face us. He cleansed the filthy grill with dried up sauce and old rice and left from previous. 

Most chefs do not talk at all. Not even a welcome. There were minimal knife and food tricks. Meanwhile, in the back of the restaurant they were fortunate to get a chef that talks and did the whole show. Our service was sloppy at best. The chef wasn't clear or orders. To the benefit of a friend who only ordered shrimp and filet mignonette, she received not only that but lobster, salmon and scallops. (Yes, I wish I got some of her mistakes.) 

I don't recommend this place. It lacks customer service (not attentive at all), chefs do not talk and lack providing the whole hibachi experience. Was odd.
Taste of food is ok.

I knew I should've gone to the Mexican restaurant with the giant margaritas a couple doors down."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"Amazing!! Everything was so good, the fried rice could have been better but other than that the food was great, we also had a Christmas roll and it definitely makes it on my top 10 favorite rolls!!"

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"I know this place as ""Something's Fishy"" but I guess they changed the name. This place is good for cheap sushi but not the best sushi. I sat at the sushi bar and was greeted by a server after a few minutes. 

I got a miso soup, spicy tuna roll, and one of the rolls on special I think it was crunchy shrimp tempera roll. All of our rolls came out pretty quickly. We had to ask for water more then once and for our sides of spicy mayo. They weren't busy at all when we came in but still took them awhile to bring us those two things. We also asked them for the check, which took us a while to get. 

Overall the sushi was very reasonably priced, all the fish tasted fresh, but the service wasn't that great. I'll probably come back here again since it was super cheap, but it wasn't my favorite place that I've had sushi in town."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Super disappointed! We went last night with the Groupon and buyer beware- it's not a deal!! What they do with the Groupon is just subtract $35 from your total bill. However you also pay $35 for the Groupon. So there is no deal.

Food: subpar. Shrimp got dry real quick. Steak was ok. Fried rice was super salty!! Veggies were good. We did not have sushi. 

Service: no complaints. Except for the Groupon discrepancy. 

Drinks: $18 for a GLASS of wine! It was on the premium list but you can buy a bottle for the glass of wine that they serve. 2 glasses was almost $40!! This isn't the Bacara. 

Unfortunately as fun of a place as this is for kids I will not be going back it's not worth the money."

I did not think you could farm tuna but the chef said all their fish was farmed.  Another chef came out later and said the Tuna was wild-caught.  The manager then claimed the salmon was farmed but wild caught, though he could not explain what that meant. 

The sushi tasted like sushi TV-dinner.  The experience had me feeling like an idiot for walking in a place that advertised ""1/2 price sushi all day long""....I should have known."

Of course, on the drive there, i asked her to bust out Yelp...3 stars? boo.  But clearly yelp was wrong.  People need to realize that this place isnt about the sushi.  The Hibachi is where its at.  

We had a quick wait for not having made reservations, and we were seated at a table with 6 jersey-shore snobs who gave our poor waitress the toughest time ever.  We prayed that she wouldn't associate us with the other group and spit in our food.

All the fancy tricks were what I expected.  The flaming volcano, and the constant 'melodious' tapping of the spatula, salt, and pepper shakers.  

Needless to say, I had an amazing dinner.  The chef was courteous, funny, and knew how to work that skillet.  Its not the best I've had, but its worth having a visit."

gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"This has been a go to sushi bar for everyone I know from Santa Bárbara to want to get together and enjoy hibachi (the wait can add up since they don't have many chefs)
Before 7, you can usually find a spot at the sushi bar easy and get your sushi order instantly even for specialty rolls.
Great prices and fresh pleasant rolls.
The only thing that would need improvement would be the staff they're always being replaced because it's pretty inconsistent and unorganized but I usually just deal with the chefs at the bar and the two men have 
always been.
Ps try the fried rice it's amazing."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"The sushi wasn't great, just OK. The half-price deal they have for sushi made it definitely worth it though. I'll be back for sure."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Sushi and service are good.  They put all of the sushi from each sheet on same platter, so you have to only order several rolls per sheet.  Kinda dumb why they wouldn't think of that already."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"We had a 730 reservation, didn't get seated until 745 and didn't even have our drinks by 810.  We sat for over an hour before the chef finally arrived at the grill.  I ordered chicken teriyaki and steak and my chicken was handed to me about 5 mins before the chef got to the grill and was told that they couldn't cook chicken on the grill.  Ive been to many hibachi grills and all have cooked my terayiki chicken on the grill.  The waitress apologized and gave us a bottle of saki on the house but that still did not account for the bad service and experience from the start."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,"I've been coming here since it was called Somethings Fishy. I was back in town for a friends wedding and felt the need to come back. I was hit with nostalgia and had the best time. We did sake bombs and had the best service. They were willing to teach us how to do the sake bomb chant accompanied by the banging of the tables, and they were willing to take all of our videos for Instagram with no complaints."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,positive,Had a great meal for my dads 55th! Staff was attentive to our large group and always approached with a smile. Would recommend and come again! Loads of food for a good cost!
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,Japanese,negative,"Worst restaurant in Santa Barbara. - local review 


Last time we came here was a NIGHTMARE
- told to wait 30 mins for table
-50 mins later and multiple times checking in to see if we can get seated (empty tables everywhere)
We were seated by the manager
- told we had to wait for the other party of 2 to show up... another 20 mins...
1 hour 40 mins later... we order...
- we get our water 10 mins later and salad 20 mins later 2hours and 10 mins later....we get our food order taken....the CHEF DOES NOT SHOW UP FOR 50 minutes ------- at this point the other party literally leaves- the manager runs after them( as we catch a waiter to ask where our chef is?!?!)

They bring us deep fried crap as a sorry and fresh nice fish to the people who ran out......are you freaking kidding me? (Also we don't eat fried food)

The couple was much older... so wE believe they also judged us by age..

Our chef arrives and does not verify our orders, doesn't say hello or smile.... he seemed exhausted... 

My salmon hibachi was raw and gummy and gross!!!

Steak was good

The kicker!! They attempted to over charge us- when we had already paid!! Said we had to pay more!! I almost wanted to throw their fried tempura at them. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. 

Also we had at least 5 different people come to refill our waters EVERY minutes!!! What is going on in this place?? Management is TERRIBLE!!!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Had another great experience at Sun Sushi last night, so I can confirm that there actually is good sushi in SB... finally. The box sushi was really good, we considered ordering a second order of it. The albacore was so fresh, we got it in sushi form as well as roll form. Good edamame too, which is always a good sign for a sushi restaurant (how can you make good sushi if you can't even make good edamame?).
The spicy tuna on crispy rice was 4/5 stars, I've had better but it was good and would order again."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,I had really good sushi there with my friends. Everything was so fresh and delicious! Me and my friends loved so much. Especially their cheese cakes which import from Japan was so good!    Highly recommend this restaurant. I definitely will come back with my friends soon! Don't miss out if you love Japanese food.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"We finally got out to try Sun Sushi - so glad we did! This place definitely lives up to its reviews. 

I had the salmon 6-steps, and in addition to the killer presentation, I found the fish itself to be just perfect. Really fresh, cut just right (I am so picky about that), with correctly prepared and sized rice ball. 

My husband ordered the box sushi roll and the Albacore Delight roll. He said the Albacore roll was good but the box sushi was completely out of this world amazing, and gave me a bite so I could agree with him. Yes, it was, and I'll order it next time! For those who have been to Sakana and are hooked on their box sushi - this is a great alternative.

My daughter got the chef's choice sushi - 10 pieces of whatever the chef thought was best. This was pretty incredible, and I'm sorry for not grabbing a photo. There was no skimping on it as some restaurants try to do - no, this had all the premium nigiri: toro, uni, jumbo shrimp, two kinds of premium yellowtail... The birthday girl was suitably impressed with her order and even more excited when the waitress surprised her with tempura green tea ice cream at the end of the meal.

One of the highlights of the service here is that the servers take the time, when they bring your order, to point out and tell you what each thing on your plate is. So if you aren't enough of a sushi expert to be able to tell what everything is at a glance, never fear!
I definitely recommend this place - a little pricier but totally worth the spend, and it comes with great service and a pleasant, traditional atmosphere."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Of ALL the sushi restaurants I've been too this place to me has by far the greatest service, price, quality and preparation of food, environment, and people of all time. G.O.A.T."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"The quality of the fresh fish here is worth 5 stars alone. It is rare to find fish this fresh in the area. I originally came here because I heard they have ocean trout, but the freshness of the tuna, salmon, etc. is going to keep me coming back. This was one of the best sushi dinners that I've had in awhile. I recommend the salmon sushi, ocean trout sushi, and avocado eel roll."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"The best sushi in town. Hands down. Forget Arigato on State St. 

Best thing you can do is sit at the bar and have a conversation with the chef while directly ordering from him. 

Also try the cold sake. Just superb. This is now my go-to spot in Santa Barbara."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"This is a jewel. You will LOVE sun sushi in Santa Barbara.  Strip center sushi place that flies sushi in from Japan.  Do not shy away from ""today's tsukiji"".  You will not be disappointed.  Enjoy it along with the Aji and an Asahi draft."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Interest menu for 6 different salmons and tuna sushi! Friendly waiter and nice price!
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"This little sushi spot is under new management or something. It is DEFINITELY worth trying! Super dank! So good! A MUST try! I had the Box Sushi, a salmon roll, and two pieces (1 order) of ikura sushi.  Love the traditional and authentic style."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Enjoyed my 2nd time at Sun Sushi as much as the first time. The wait staff is attentive and helpful in helping you order their delicacies. They get fresh fish from Japan on Tuesdays and Fridays. The salmon 6 step(6 different ways on an attractive wooden step structure) was especially tasty. 2 thumbs up for the replacement of Ahi. They're all veterans of other Sushi places in SB and have added their own touch and flourish to a Sushi establishment.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,negative,Wayyy overpriced for it being so unimpressive. The sushi pieces are very expensive but the quality of the fish and preparation don't match up to that price. It doesn't hit any mark. There is better sushi. There is cheaper sushi. And there are other places with more thrills. I'm not sure where this one fits in
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Gyoza was crispy, my wife loved it. Service was attentive. Six step salmon was a delight and all flavors and textures were on point. Will be coming back."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"My friend and I got advice from guy (who works at Camarillo premium outlets ""Nike"" store) to stop by at this sushi place.
We came from Los Angeles to try this place. The staff was very friendly, we got served by Lucy, very very nice and friendly lady. She gave us advices what to pick."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,I came here for lunch with my coworker and it was delicious!  She got the salmon and I got udon and we were both very happy. The owner was very attentive and let us know we can park at the hotel because parking in this complex can be difficult.  We will definitely be coming back!
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Staff couldn't have been more helpful and the service was incredible. In and out in 25 minutes. The food was very good and I was checked in on after every plate. Definitely going back.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Best sushi in the area. People there is nice:) good service and new place. Love it. Recommend the fresh eel sushi. Best in town.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,I went here on a whim and it was one of the most pleasant dinner experiences I've had. The place was poppin but we got seated immediately. Service was amazing and the sushi chefs was particularly amiable. Will come back!
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,negative,In short: the salmon that we had was not of the great quality in terms of freshness and cut - one of the peaces had a bone in it and the meat get hard and a bit smelly. The price range at this place is the same as at Arigato but more than half lower in quality. Maybe it was just a bad day but it was what it was
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"This place is delicious and the best Japanese food I've tried in Santa Barbara. I grew up in the bay and this place is comparable to Japanese restaurants there. I got the dragon roll which is a California roll with eel and avocado and it was sooooo good. My friend got the crunch roll and his was also very good, but we agreed that the dragon roll was better. Bathroom was also really clean. Definitely visiting this place again!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Awesome local place. This is our new favorite and hasn't been dethroned in over a year. We like to sit at the bar and try specials as well as their Delight roll which is incredible. The staff is super nice. It's not a fancy place until you taste the sushi- then it be like ""fabulous."""
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"This restaurant has to be one of the best sushi restaurants you can find in Santa Barbara. The service, the fish, the prices, the atmosphere... Simply just wow. Please, do yourself a favor and dine at this restaurant. 

We loved every single dish we ordered. In particular, the Tsukiji market special. Yes, the famous fish market in Tokyo! They receive these fish from Japan, and you can taste the quality. Well worth the money. I don't remember all the names of the fish, but the servers were so knowledgeable, and explained each type.  

The dessert was so tasty, we ordered the ice cream tempura (yum!), and two slices of cheesecake. We chose the mango, and the matcha green tea.  

Compliments to the sushi chef, for what we gather from the server he has been doing sushi for a very long time, and was trained in Japan at a young age.

Thanks for such a great experience!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,What a great little place. The waitress was very. Not expensive. Fish was high quality and the appetizers were awesome!
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"This place defines ""beyond expectations""!! Me and my husband decided to give it a try but not expecting a lot bc, you know, it's Santa Barbara (we came to SB from the Bay Area and have struggled a little bit adjusting to the ""meh"" food scene here). Walking in it was already a pleasant surprise: very beautifully decorated place: tradicional Japanese bamboo and curtains and super cool cement floors. From the moment we sat down we had AMAZING service: attentive, knowledgeable, sweet and polite. Not only was our server outstanding, but also everyone in the restaurant checked on us throughout the meal to see how we were doing and every single one of them bid us farewell on our way out. Honestly one of the best services I've ever had in SB. And then last but not least, the food!! OMG! So fresh and delicious. So delicate and with such well balanced flavors and the presentation was just out of this world. Honestly we were blown away by our experience. Thank you very much Sun Sushi team. We have found our new favorite restaurant in SB!!!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Sun is the best sushi in Santa Barbara.  They serve the highest quality fish - its as simple as that.  Excellent service too.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Coming from Los Angeles, we were used to really good sushi and we're disappointed to find out that there really aren't very many good places in Santa Barbara. Once we saw this new place open up near us, we were super excited to try it out! 

The staff was very friendly and attentive as well as professional and respectful. *PRO TIP* sit at the bar! 

The food we ordered was very good. We ordered 4 rolls and enjoyed all of them! Only thing I would change is portion size. The rolls were very small, but tasted great! We will definitely be returning with family and friends!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"We were in the neighborhood and decided to have some sushi, so I yelped this place and was very happy with my decision. The fish was so fresh, it just melted in your mouth. If you are ever in the neighborhood, stop by and give them a try. You will not be disappointed."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,This is our favorite sushi restaurant. The food is so fresh & the staff is so attentive. The delight rolls are my favorite. Ignore the strip mall location- it's so good.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Great great place. Food, service, huge sake selection, seriously no complaints. My wife always has green tea but she loves it hot hot. She always has to ask, except here. They kept it full, fresh and hot. They are eager, friendly, will do any sashimi, nigiri or roll custom. Give it a try..."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"If you are looking for fresh sushi, this is the place you should go. The sushi-6-step, that is 6 different favors of salmon is very tasty. The service is very attentive. I'll definitely be going back."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Ahi (the previous sushi restaurant in this location) was my regular ""go-to"" sushi place and it was very good.  Sun Sushi is even better.  Stopped in this evening and was pleased to see it was busy but had room or one more.
Ordered the steamed edamame  spicy tuna roll and California roll (I'm stuck in a 90's rut).  It was delicious fresh and worthy of 5 stars.
The wait staff were cordial and attentive but not overly so (as stated in other reviews). I have found a new ""go-to"" place.
I will try the 6-step salmon next time.  Saw it at the next table and it looked delicious."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,negative,"Honestly I think I've missed something here. I chose Sun Sushi based on the percentage of 5 star ratings on Yelp. I called at 7:00 p.m. to make last minute reservations for 7:30 that evening, Friday. I was told by a women I spoke to that they were all filled and there was a line out the door. With that said, My friend and I thought to just just drive by and see for ourselves and or find another place to dine. We arrived at 7:30 no line and there were open seats at the sushi bar along with 3 empty tables... 

When we entered the restaurant the gentleman asked if we had a reservation and I told I called and the women that answered would take one. Anyway, We were seated. Service was very OK. It took me to finally get the attention of a server to take out drink and food order.

We ordered the Soft Shell Crab Tempura Appetizer, Salmon Skin Roll, Yellow Tail, Uni, Salmon, Sweet Shrimp, Smelt Egg with Quail Eggs and Halibut Sushi along with a Salmon-6-Step.

All the fish was of OK quality not the best. the Yellow Tail smelt a little fishy. The Smelt Egg presentation was sloppy with eggs falling off and the Quail Eggs about to drip off. The Salmon-6-Steps was very OK too. The Uni was not the price listed on the menu in fact it was an outrages $15 (isn't Santa Barbara famous for their Uni?) The worse part of the meal was the Tempura Crab and Fried Shrimp Heads. I don't know where they get the recipe from but it certainly was not Tempura which should be served HOT in temperature and light in batter. The coating was a very heavy batter and all the fried food was barely room temperature.. so bad was the Crab that I had to pick off the batter to eat the crab. 

Food OK, Tempura horrible, Service OK."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"First time we had a miscommunication with the reservation but we went back the next week and had an amazing meal.   The selection was traditional and also very unique.  We ate so much because we wanted to try everything.  Great service, good prices but make a reservation.  It is a small place and limited seating.  Can't wait to go back."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"One of the best sushi restaurants in Santa Barbara - quite possibly my new favorite! The guys behind the bar were great, and the sushi was amazingly delicious - obviously fresh, high-quality fish skillfully and artfully prepared.  Wonderful service, wonderful sushi.  I will definitely be back soon and often!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Great addition to the neighborhood! We liked it when it was Ahi but the service was slow and frustrating when hungry. The service tonight was impeccable, the fish fresh, the rice perfect and the rolls tight. The chicken teriyaki appetizer had enough for a meal. We are loving the new decor too! Come check it out, you won't be disappointed"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"this place has the HIGHEST quality fish, they must be paying big bucks to get fish that tastes this good. I haven't ever had the pleasure of eating fish that tastes this great. I do also really enjoy the service here because of how quickly they seat you and help you"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"The sushi chefs were very attentive and customer service was excellent. This place is great to go when you want a casual date night spot but great sushi. The place is not loud so you will be able to talk with your date or party and you are in and out so no long wait times.

You get great quality and big rolls for the amount you pay. I got the 6 ways salmon which comes on an awesome display wooden plank. My favorite was the yellowtail delight roll because it was large and filling! The chefs really put their passion and creativity into creating great sushi."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Terrific new sushi spot for locals right next to Tee Off. Real Japanese chefs, fresh fish & great service. Complete meal, nice addition to the SB dining scene. Very fresh fish which is primordial for sushi. Great meal!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Ahi used to be my favorite sushi place in the city.  It was certainly the most authentic and cost less than Arigato.  Good food doesn't seem to guarantee success in this city.  The quality faded over the years, and finally it closed its door.  Sun sushi continues the tradition of offering choices that you can't get anywhere else in the city.  The salmon 6 steps was impeccably fresh.  My favorite was the buttery lightly seared nigiri.  Two of the pieces were a little too tart in my opinion.  I also loved the cubed salmon served in the spoon.  They were all delicately seasoned and should be eaten without any soy sauce that might muddle the flavor.  The Japanese scallop was silky and sweet.  The snow crab was topped with crab miso, a sauce made with crab liver.  Its one of those flavor that makes whole crab so much tastier than pasteurized crab meat.  The spicy tuna with crispy rice was similar to the version served at Nikka Ramen.  Sun Sushi's was less sweet and the crispy rice was more manageable in size.  The udon could use some change.  They went overboard with the seaweed and by the time all the seaweed were rehydrated, the soup became too salty.  The tempura side need to be reconfigured.  The broccoli and onion were cut too big, therefore, the middle of the broccoli had undercooked dough while the onion was still raw.  I was disappointed that I no longer see the 5 course omakase meal on the menu."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Sun Sushi is a local sushi restaurant with high quality fish.  They don't use much local fish except for uni.  Most comes from Japan and Korea.  Ask Max the owner or John the head sushi chef about the origin of everything.   They will gladly tell you. They have a very nice presentation of their Salmon tower, which includes Scottish and Atlantic salmon and ocean trout.  Very nice flavors.  I also recommend the amberjack--always very fresh.  John makes a very nice monkfish liver, and he will give you a taste to see if you like it before you buy."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Amazing sushi good prices, friendly staff, nice ambiance. Sit at the bar. Get the state street roll"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,negative,"I was disappointed for the most part. They have some kind of gross mayonnaise sauce and/or eel sauce on almost every cut roll. Tasted like miracle whip. I felt the menu was limited to many of the same things in different combos. 
On the bright side, the fish tasted fresh. The tempura veggies were pretty good. 
Not a nice strip mall, would not go back. Fairly expensive for what we got."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Food was great, service was great, this place is great. 

Ive been to Sun sushi twice and this most recent visit was really great. I was a little worried about going here since the last time I ate here over a year ago, the restaurant seemed to be going through some repairs and it was very hot in there. This time they have an updated decor with a bamboo wall (with signs that say don't touch) and overall the setup in there looks better. Any who, I went on a Friday night and I did not have a reservation--didn't think I needed one but I would suggest you make s reservation if you know you want to dine here. I had a relatively short 30 minute wait to get seated and while I was waiting the staff was friendly and attentive. 

We had three different special rolls and all were great. We started with the shrimp tempura roll, then the tiger roll, and finally with the sun roll. All were excellent but the one that really stood out was the tiger roll--you could taste the freshness. We ended up ordering a spicy tuna roll at the end because even with three rolls we were still a bit hungry.  

This is a bit of an expensive sushi restaurant but you pay for what you get, I'll definitely be going back for more delicious sushi."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"This has got to be one of the best Japanese restaurant in SB. I highly recommend it to everyone who is a Japanese foodie! 

They have  a good variety of food on their menu and they even have sushi omakase style. All the ones that me and my friends tried were really delicious and the fish is of high quality and fresh. Their salmon skin salad is outstanding and by far my personal favorite out of all the foods we tried. 

The ambiance made my dining experience much more enjoyable as it reminds me of Japanese restaurants I went to when I was in Tokyo. 

Service is of course excellent which is always the case with Japanese. Very friendly staff, accommodating and attentive as well.  

I would definitely go back to try their other stuff and I am excited to try their omakase too. This restaurant is a nice addition to the food scene in SB."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"We ordered Toro, Amber Jack, Mada and Tamago, as well as shishito tempura and gyoza appetizers. All of it was very good, especially the tamago. Good atmosphere and the sushi chef at the bar was very friendly. Would recommend."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Good sushi and a great staff. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed and the sushi was great.  The Caterpillar Roll looked like it was shrunken (bonsai sushi?) and was adequate.  the fish/shrimp quality was good with the amaebi and albacore being deliicious.  I will have to go back... they ran out of the local uni.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"The Best sushi in town!!! Ask for Max, he will fill   all your sushi dreams !!!!!!!!!!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Their sushi and salmon skin salad were very good. The place is nice and service was very good too.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"I was very hesitant to try a new sushi place as I only go to Aragato and Sakana here in town.  I live here now but am from Los Angeles originally. LA does not have a lack of good sushi.  Unfortunately Santa Barbra has limited choices. This place had fresh sushi.  The uni was the perfect color.  I also had the Salmon 6 piece taster...perfect!  It was a little on the prices side, but what good sushi in Santa Barbra is it?!?! I would definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone that is a sushi connoisseur."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Best quality sushi and amazing service! Our server, Kelly, remembered everything we ordered off the top of his head! He was friendly and upbeat! Checked on us all the time even during a dinner rush! We felt spoiled. This place is a MUST TRY!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Amazing fort lunch- have had fantastic dinners here as well- the go-to sushi spot in Santa Barbara for foodies looking for the real deal!
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Dining at Sun Sushi is as close to dining in Japan as one can be while still being in Santa Barbara. The fish is exceptional, expertly prepared and always super delicious. I appreciate that the chefs bring in exotic fish because I feel that all too often, every sushi menu seems to mirror the next but there are often new things to try here. The sake menu changes often as well which is always appreciated. 

Try it out. You won't be disappointed!"
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Seriously what are you waiting for? GO get some Sushi! But..i do Highly reccomend coming in early for a nice quiet Vibe.
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Decided to try this place since it got good reviews so far! I came in around 5pm on a Saturday night for takeout. I was happily greeted by the host and the sushi chefs behind the beautiful bamboo wall. 

I ordered the spicy yellowtail roll, soft shell crab appetizer, I love crab! And a cali hand roll. They can make handrolls of any of the menu items. Took only 15 minutes or less since they weren't very crowded maybe 8 customers. And happily on my way home to savor the sushi!

The host guy even offered me ice water while I wait since it was like 85 degrees today!

I would have given them a 5 star since the sushi and soft shell crab was outstanding but they forgot to give me wasabi and ginger. 

I'll definitely be back! Next time on a Tuesday or Thursday night when they have freshly flown in fish from Japan and have a special menu to reflect the freshness."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"My friend and I had a really great dinner here. We order the salmon six step (which is my favorite), the shrimp and vegi udon, and the salmon skin salad. Everything is fresh and the flavor is great. The most important was all the staff were very friendly. We really enjoy it. Definitely will recommend my friend to have Japanese food here."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,OMG!!! Best Sushi ever had HANDS DOWN!!!! Staff was really nice and food was AMAZING!!!!
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Really good, family friendly and clean place. Service was great, staff was so nice! I will come back when I'm in town again."
jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,Pretty good here. The service was good. We got 2 rolls and some udon soup and it was 48$ so a little pricy. I would definitely be back because it's close to home and very tasty. They are also open for lunch so that's a plus

jR3sTUWCPuOCWpdm8Pn-wQ,Sun Sushi,Japanese,positive,"Sun Sushi is our favourite sushi place in Santa Barbara. I get the Volcano roll every time --a California roll with spicy mayo, eel sauce and bay scallops broiled on top. Delish. Hubby goes for the Rainbow roll and the Sun roll, with which I'm always happy to help him out. Sun's teriyaki salmon is great -- thick, perfectly done pieces of salmon and the right amount of teriyaki. Most places want to drown the fish in it, so I really appreciate the chef's touch. They use a tasty version of wasabi too, a slightly thicker grate to it, and a sweeter taste. I'm usually not a wasabi fan, but I love Sun's wasabi. I'm sharing this with y'all so you help keep this gem in business. Spread the word; I'm willing to wait for a seat."

I'm visiting Santa Barbara on business so decided to take the yelp stars to the test and Sun Sushi passed it with flying colors. Generous well prepared extremely fresh fish. I had the 6-step tuna, Salmon sushi, Kurodai Sushi and Yellow Tail sushi. All were excellent! I'll be back next time I'm in town!!!"
