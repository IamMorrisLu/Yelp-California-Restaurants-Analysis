# Yelp-California-Restaurants-Analysis
Led an NLP analysis project to evaluate customer satisfaction across five cuisines (American, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Italian) using Yelp reviews in California, focusing on Service, Price, Wait times, and Quality.
Processed and analyzed data by categorizing over X reviews into positive and negative sentiments, utilizing BERTopic modeling for topic identification and zero-shot modeling to refine focus areas.
Implemented advanced NLP techniques to extract and analyze key sentiments, generating word clouds for visual insight and identifying critical customer values from textual feedback.
Uncovered strategic insights indicating the paramount importance of customer service, the need for reduced wait times, the impact of food quality on satisfaction, and the necessity for refined pricing strategies tailored to cuisine-specific nuances.
Recommended actionable strategies for service improvement, wait time reduction, quality enhancement, and pricing adjustment to align with customer expectations, driving potential business growth and customer satisfaction enhancement.
