# Yelp-California-Restaurants-Analysis
Situation: You embarked on an NLP project to analyze restaurant reviews across five different cuisines (American, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, Italian) in California. The data was sourced from Yelp and categorized into positive (4, 5 stars) and negative (1, 2, 3 stars) reviews.

Task: The objective was to understand what customers value the most in their dining experiences. This involved preprocessing the data, segregating it by cuisine, and then using BERTopic modeling to identify key aspects like Service, Price, Wait times, and Quality.

Action: By applying zero-shot modeling, you focused on the four main topics to examine customer sentiment. For each cuisine, you analyzed the proportion of negative and positive reviews, created word clouds for visual representation, and extracted keywords to pinpoint customer priorities.

Result: The analysis revealed that customer service is paramount across all cuisines, indicating a need to prioritize service quality improvement. It also highlighted the importance of addressing wait times, maintaining high food quality standards, refining pricing strategies to reflect perceived value, and considering cuisine-specific nuances in strategy development.
