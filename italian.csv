xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza.  We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.  I'm sorry to say I won't be able to take the kids here anymore."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,The delivery would bring me the wrong pizza and of course it's with the 2 toppings I despise the most. Just my luck. #alwayscheckyourpizza #whatsinthebox
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"The pizza here is the best pizza that I have had short of some of the gourmet pizza parlors that are in town. The pizza is just a little expensive, but down right tasty. 
They have always been pretty speedy on there delivery which is quite nice but I had to take a star off because I am pretty sure I have had to pat down every pizza of there's with a paper towel because they are always so greasy."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"So pizza is pizza, so I wasn't expecting anything grand. (Especially after having Woodstocks--nothing can compete!) But the place looked like this place I used to go back in my town which offered a salad bar too, so I was all ready for it. 

First off, the salad bar ain't free. But you can't even ADD it onto your pizza; it's a whole different order. It's $6 for a ""large"" which is pretty much your average bowl size. The small was half that. WHAT A RIP OFF. They did have a special though which was two slices of pizza and a small salad bar bowl for $7 total, but it was only for lunch and we were there for dinner. But what's even worse is that you can only make ONE TRIP to the salad bar! I mean if you're going to make us pay an obscene amount for it and have small bowls, you might as well let us get as much as we want, but noooooo.

But the salad was alright. Nothing worth $6 though FOR SURE. We ordered a half pepperoni and half hawaiian on thin crust, which I admit was good. Again, nothing spectacular. Probably not going to be coming here again unless I'm desperate and it's lunch time."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"Incredible pizza. My family always gets the BBQ chicken with cashews and Garden Special with pineapple. There's just something about how the pizza is made that distinguishes it from other places. The toppings are loaded on, the crust is crispy (especially if you order thin crust, which has more thickness to it than other places and is my go-to), and the sauces are super flavorful. So many childhood memories here too. Be prepared to pay big bucks for really good pizza."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Its baffling how Rusty's became the most prolific pizza joint in this town.  Its national chain quality pizza at a premium price.  The boring looking salad bar reminded me of Pizza Hut.  The uniformly round sausage kibbles reminded me of those rectangular ""oh so tasty"" school cafeteria pizza.  I came here for the first time in 4 years because it was the last day of Youth Soccer.  The place was completely kid friendly, like Chuck e Cheese, Pizza Hut, and Little Caesar all roll into one.  I have kids and even I think its too kid friendly, maybe that how they compete with super cheap Costco pizza across the street and better American style pizza places scattered around town."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"This location has a very strange vibe. Not so much for adults not so much for children. This location used to be a bank and gives it a very corporate style. This location need a little more maintenance from their cleaning clue as well, but the pizza was very good. The meatball sub was so-so for the price. I would recommend ordering for delivery."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"Same great pizza as all the other locations. Always found it interesting that they turned the old safe room, from when it used to be a bank, into a windowless party room."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Don't place a delivery order from here, or actually any location. You'll get the pleasure of speaking with an employee who sounds miserable. I have placed a delivery order twice and never again will that happen. The first order I placed was a pepperoni pizza. Sounds simple right? But when the girl on the other end asked me what toppings I wanted I simply said pepperoni, obviously because cheese comes with your pizza unless otherwise stated. When my pizza arrived I had a pizza with pizza sauce and pepperoni. She had actually taken me literally. 
The next time I ordered delivery I ordered a pepperoni with 2 extra toppings. When I asked the SAME girl if cheese came on the pizza she answered annoyed ""Ya, it's standard"" .. Yeah I know. Rustys is crap when it comes to customer service."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,Cute place. Pizza parlor with brass and frosted windows. Arcade video games. Reminds me of pizza that you would find in the Midwest.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Good pizza, but lousy service.

Look, Rusty's has been here forever and the pie has been generally good a long time.  But their delivery time is long and their customer service is pretty consistently crappy and getting worse.  

Good luck getting the correct pizza, and good luck getting them to fix it if it isn't right.  That just isn't Goleta, guys.

Also, website for ordering sucks.  Better to just place a call and cross your fingers.  Or like, find somewhere else.  Pizza is everywhere."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Yikes. Cold, fatty chicken wings. When told the server they were cold, the reply was, ""what do you want me to do about it?"" Pizza just okay. The water dispenser not working, either. We also waited 25 minutes for our food for dine-in. We only ordered a personal pizza and wings. I repeat, ""yikes."""
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"well this place sure was a disappointment, but not such a surprise after 1- walking in and 2 - dealing with the cashier

so a friend from the SB area told me this was ""the"" spot for pizza..ok well we drove by, saw it, figure why not give it a shot

walk in to screaming kids..everywhere...guess this is one of those party kids family type of pizza joints..ok not TOO bad let's see how the rest goes

after looking at the menu...which doesn't have a lot to offer...we ordered a 
Medium of half rustys special and half chicken garlic mushroom, Garlic cheese bread and a Beer
wow the cashier was a total imbecile

I stated each item one at a time..
Me: ""garlic cheese bread small size""
Cashier: ""what?
Me: ""a small garlic cheese bread""
Cashier: ""what size?
Me: ""small...""
cashier: ""ranch or pizza sauce?""
me: ""one of each please, we'll pay the extra it's fine""
cashier: ""do you want ranch or pizza sauce?""
seriously . . .

then the pizza...
Me: ""then a medium pizza, half rusty's special (I paused to let him type it in)
Cashier: ""okay what kind of pizza?""
Me: ""half rusty's special (pause) half chicken garlic mushroom""
Cashier: ""ok so half rusty's special, half bacon peppers and onion?""
ME: seriously?? ""no, chicken mushroom garlic""

then when our beer was ""Ready"" he isn't on the intercom to call our name on the order or anything, he is standing at the cashier, waving his arms trying to get my attention...then when i go up there to see what it is, he was no where to be found...yeesh

beer tasted flat and watered down
pizza was garbage...digiornio is better
garlic cheese bread is the only reason for the 2 stars because it seemed this wasnt even made at this joint

wellp, at least we can say we never tried it right?"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"How anyone thinks this is better than Ellios pizza is celebrating a little too hard at the local dispensary. Have you ever tasted good pizza before?  I'm from NY and the taste was literally laughable. Good service,  though.  Keep that up, you guys."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Love Rustys Garlic Cheesy Bread and my hubby is always up for pizza. Round that off with salad and we're good to go. Usually fast, efficient, and communicative. Today, order was done, but no one bothered to call our name or nunber, so we waited and waited. Hubby finally found our order on the counter...Will re-evaluate with next visit. $20 seemed a bit high for lunch deal for 2."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"Ohhhh Rusty's how I love you.  Your sausage and olive is so good.  Your pepperoni and pineapple is sweet and just a bit spicy.  Your veggie with pineapple and jalapeno doesn't make me feel guilty because there are so many good things on it.  All on thin crust of course.

Sadly, I have moved to L.A. and I just can't find a good pizza there to save my life.  I've gotten close, but it's just not the same.  It's so easy for others to bash you for being ""so expensive"" but when I can't buy your gooey goodness on a whim, I am so sad.  Please Rusty's...move to L.A. so my suffering can stop."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I work near El Capitan and I am constantly referring guests to order from here since they are the only ones who will deliver this far out, or at least I did until I was told that they wouldn't come out due to a fire that isn't anywhere nearby when we weren't even evacuated! So disappointing that they either aren't aware of their own community or they simply no longer wish to serve the area. I will no longer be referring those who ask for take out; it's better to simply drive to Isla Vista and eat at Woodstocks or any of the much better restaurants there."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Ok, so you can't really call to place an order.
It goes to an operator, that will call back to confirm your order.
The call back never happens, so you have to call again to confirm.

Picking up the pizza down the street, there was a smoker right at the door, always appetizing.

The parlor itself was cool, and old bank re-furbed. Nice arcade machines, cool place for a kids B-day party.

Got home, pizza was very good, not as good as I hoped.
For $23 eh~

Next time maybe Costco pizza $10 right next door."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"After seeing so many Rusty's Pizza Parlors here, we figured we should at least try it. Don't make the same mistake as us! While my husband liked it a little better than Little Caesars, I did not. If you want delicious pizza, go to Woodstock's. If you want inexpensive pizza, go to Little Caesars. At Rusty's you will get an expensive ""meh"" pizza. We got half bbq and half meat mania. Neither was very good. 

Customer service was also dismal. When I called with a simple question the person on the other end seemed annoyed by me and was very curt.

We will never go back to Rusty's. Not a good pizza, price, or service."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"They only get one star because there isn't an option for zero stars. Horrible pizza, then they got our order wrong, I call them back and their response is yeah we can send another one but you have to pay the delivery fee??? Hun?? I have to pay for your mistakes?? I won't even get started on the absolutely disgusting hot wings,. Well, yes I will, they were tiny and 95%fat (literally no meat at all)

I will never eat there again and highly suggest you don't bother wasting your money there"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Not my favorite due to the copious amounts of grease. There are many better places to get pizza in Goleta: Gina's, Woodstock's, and Pizza My Heart to name a few. Pizza is pizza though so 2 stars."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,Deng these yelp reviews are harsh. Rustys is freakin awesome. They have been my pizza of choice since I was kid. Love this place. Only pizza delivery I ever order. Never been inside but their delivery is fast and pizza is good.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"The pizza here is not too bad but sadly a bit overpriced. But I just recently discovered the ""quick-lunch"" special with includes a personal 2 topping 10-inch pizza, one trip salad bar(which was pretty good with fresh ingredient), and a drink all for $6.95! WIth the old-school arcade games and huge flat screen tv, its a pretty chill place to eat with friends and hang out."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"fresh made dough with a very nice crunch in the crust. i can't call it a crunch, i think its more of a light crisp on the edges."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"This review is strictly for the food only!

I am a pretty simple gal when it comes to pizza, no fancy toppings, just pepperoni and mushroom. 

My pizza was quickly made but wasn't all that great. The toppings were delish but the crust had a frozen pizza feel and taste.

Maybe the pan crust will be better!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"ok. so i wanted pizza. and i have had rusty's before, and it was good. sure, they have expensive ingredients, thus a pricier pizza.  But what happened to me this rainy night in january is unforgivable. My roommates agreed to order a thin crust pizza, which i felt i would get more for my money with a personal pan pizza than a few slices of cheese and cracker pizza.  Horribly, my personal pizza was about $8 and i got the equivalent of 2 thin slices.  My roommates just mocked me as i sat there eating my sorry slices.  I'm not sure whether they had made me a thin crust personal or not, i didnt see the receipt. In the end, irony reared its ugly head...i felt totally ripped off and my roommates offered me a slice because they had filled up. One is the loneliest number."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Last night I called to place a pick up order, they refused to take a call-in because ""they are too busy""... their solution for me was to go place an order in person. What!?!?! You're a place of business, right? I don't even have anything else to say, just wow."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"If there was an option for zero stars, I would have selected that option.  I've utilized their services multiple times, but only because they have a monopoly on delivery in my neighborhood. 

My first experience with Rusty's Pizza, I walked into their location in Goleta on Storke and Hollister, and wanted to order a pizza to go.  They first told me that the wait was going to be 90 minutes, and that I had to call a phone number to place the order.  I was already at the location, why would I have to make a phone call to place the order?  They lady behind the counter was rude, sighed, and rolled her eyes, and reluctantly called the manager to ask for permission to take the order in person.  Since it was going to take 90 minutes  I asked if I could have it delivered, since limitations due to my disability were preventing me from being able to stay for a long period of time.   They told me that they could not deliver the pizza, that I had to wait, and proceeded to mock me because my disability was not apparent to them.  The rude lady at the counter then proceeded to roll her eyes again, and express another discontented sigh, as she asked the manager if they could deliver.  Finally, everything was sorted out, and my pizza was delivered.  This time, they did offer a Free Pizza and Garlic Cheese Bread for the inconvenience, but only after I spoke with their call center supervisor (who hung up on me) and called their corporate office number to file a complaint about the whole experience. 

When I called back to take advantage of the Free Pizza and Garlic Cheese Bread, they had no record of it, and I had to argue the whole situation over again, and after about an hour, they honored it. I had to wait over two hours for a cheese pizza, that was cold, and overcooked, not to mention they forgot the pizza sauce to go with my large cheese bread.  I had to wait another 60 minutes to receive the pizza sauce that should have been there in the first place, and for a replacement cheese pizza, that was equally as burnt as the first.  So again, I had to go through the process of speaking to their call center, and being treated horribly by their supervisors, and having to speak to their corporate offices again, I was offered another comped meal. 

When I called to take advantage of the offer, there was yet again no record in the system.  The call center continued to mock me, and make fun of my disability, and refused to do anything productive to help with the situation.  They kept mocking me, and telling me to call corporate over and over.  They refused to provide their information so that I could file a complaint.  Finally they promised that the manager of that particular franchise would be giving me a call per my request. I placed an order online for my food. 

Now, a week later, I placed another order, and proceeded to ask about the call back I was supposed to receive.  The supervisor on the line looked up my initial complaint, and proceeded to mock me in a condescending tone about the details of my initial complaint, including the nature of my disability.  I told her that she was taking things out of context, and I needed to speak to her supervisor. She refused to provide her name at first, and finally she said her name was Abigail. Another supervisor came on the line, and refused to provide any assistance, and continued to demand that I call corporate into the phone, continuously talking over me, repeating the phone number, mocking me and the nature of my disability.  I did not have a way to take the number down, and had to have a friend call to obtain the corporate number for me, so that I could contact them.  

I left a voicemail explaining everything, now we shall se what will happen.  I have NEVER been treated so horribly by a company, and NEVER have I been so insulted."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I've been to the other Rusty's and I like them better... this one still has used-to-be-a-bank lighting and vibe. I always get the BBQ Chicken Pizza with no chicken, and this last time I went they burned the cashews and the cilantro didn't look very fresh. Don't get me wrong, we still ate the pizza.

The locks on the girls bathroom doors were busted.
The service was good.
I just prefer the other locations!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Average pizza place.  What makes this a three star is that it's in an old bank, you can eat in the vault!  I also get nostalgic because this is one of the few pizzerias that have video games and a salad bar...just don't see much of that anymore!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"terrible pizza. ordered a pepperoni, and it was covered with bald spots where cheese was missing. delivery is fast--maybe because they waste no time on the pizza itself. i'll stick to pizza places in isla vista from now on. lesson learned."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"I've been coming to this location for years since I've lived in the Ellwood area. Rusty's is a great pizza parlor! Whether you're wanting to grab some beer and a pizza with your buddies or enjoy family gatherings, this location has two private rooms (one of them being an old bank vault).

The decor is also pretty cool, this location was once a bank and has multiple checks from over 100 years ago framed up on the walls. 

The staff is friendly and the salad bar is fresh!! If you visit for lunch, highly recommend ordering the Rusty's Lunch Special. You get an individual 2-topping pizza, a small salad and drink for an amazing price ($9-13 depending on your choice of pizza toppings)!

My favorite pizza would have to be the BBQ Chicken and let's not forget a side HOT wings and ranch!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Friendly staff. Unfortunately place was very dirty. Bathrooms were unsanitary and no locks on stall doors. Dirty cleaning towels on salad bar, tables not cleaned. Understaffed. Recommend health inspection strongly."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I order pizza almost every Friday Night...not just one but two. Rusty's Pizza has the worst customer service. After spending over $50.00...and they are able to see my records of how much I order. I complained for the first time that the pizza had an overload of sauce...the sauce practically ran down my hand when I took a bite of it. Plus in addition it left a weird bitter aftertaste. We are a family of 6 and the kids grabbed the pizza when it came which left one of the pizzas to have only a few slices left The second pizza was whole. When I called to speak with the manager he said that they would need the pizza back to ""inspect it"" and that he will replace it with a new one. When I explained that it is already too late in the night and to just give me credit he said he could only give me it for one. They keep track of your orders and can clearly see that I am a frequent customer not just someone who is just trying to get something for free like they made me feel. I hope that the owner reads this because I feel that the management at Rusty's is always poor...the staff always seems miserable."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,We have been going to Rustys since the 70s. Its a good neighborhood pizza place.  The thin crust is the way to go.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I ordered their delivery.  The order was prepared and delivered fast.  nice work.

Not a good value:
the product was good,  but it is overpriced for what you get.  The pizza isn't substantial enough to make ordering from here worth it.  It's thin crust, thin layer of sauce and a thin layer of cheese.  If I'm spending $23 for a delivered pizza, I expect to have some for left-overs.  Not enough food for the high price.

I come from a part of the country where a $20 pizza could feed a family of four.  This pizza would barely feed the heterosexual dad!

Woodstock's pizza is worth the money, but beware the college kids will randomly close early so I stopped counting on them."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,Good pizza spot if ur low on money for under 7 bucks u get a personal pizza drink n salad can't go wrong
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Uneven experience here today.  The pizza itself was decent... Nothing special.  The service was horrible,  which is odd considering we were the only customers.  The employees were all hanging outside the employee door while basic things like filling the ice bin on the soda machine hadn't been done.  The staff refused to provide us with metal utensils,  so we used plastic forks on the hot pizza until they melted.  I despise lazy service.  They are lucky to have the grade I gave them."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,Rusty's is a nice place to get pizza if you've only ever had frozen pizza and want to gradually arrive at the level of delight that comes with eating a fresh pie. This location benefits from an old bank theme to entertain the old bank enthusiasts in your party.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,best pizza in goleta and iv.  woodstocks sucks in comparison and the deliver to iv.  try the deep dish!
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Good Pizza, but BEWARE of the up-charge and their ""forgetting"" to apply coupon.

I like Rusty's.  I have been in there a few times and the service is fair, even though you do feel weird about all the signs that you only get one visit to the salad bar.  Fine.  I'm sure that has been abused.  The pizza is good.  Not ""omg, this is amazing!"" but, good.

Now my beef with them.  I usually order takeout from Woodstocks.  I get a flier saying to try their new Chile Verde pizza for $3.00 off, so we decide to call having had the flier up on our fridge for a while.  The picture looks delicious and includes a picture of cilantro on top of it.  Heck, their FB is CURRENTLY touting the pizza with cilantro on it AND a bowl of cilantro on the side.

Why is cilantro important?

Well, when I order, they asked ""would you like cilantro?""  I say yes, of course, thinking that they are looking out for me and making sure I'm not averse to it since it's a specialty pizza and must be included, right?  I then specify that I have a coupon and they take the information and my credit card info for $3.00 off.  

When the poor delivery guy comes and I notice that not only did they charge me an outrageous amount for cilantro (because apparently it does NOT come standard despite the ad), they did not give me my $3.00 discount.  I ask the driver and his response is ""sorry, I only get the receipts, you'll have to call them back.""

Honest mistake, right?  

WRONG.  They have done this to me TWO TIMES and my neighbor once.  After they did this to us the second time, I was mad at myself for failing to tell my husband about it before he got duped and found this happened to our neighbors after I shared with them the story the next time we were going to order pizza.  

So, there you go.  Not an honest way to sell pizza if you ask me."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,Terrible service. Twice I've called in orders and they lost them. This last time I reordered and waited only to have them make it completely wrong. Never again.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,Customers! Go to the bathroom before you come here. Bathrooms are disgusting and the doors on the bathroom are so short you can watch the person go to the bathroom and there are no locks. This place is in desperate need of a hard cleaning and remodel.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"I had an OK experience here. 

Pros: The price was very reasonable, about $7 for the 6"" two topping personal pizza I ordered. I enjoyed the food. 

Cons: The establishment could be cleaner, the owner responded to me about the other issues and all is well."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Came here because it's the local spot to my boy.  It's not NY style pizza, nor is it deep dish pizza.  The pizza itself is DECENT, but not good, nor is it bad.  The crust is good, the cheese tasted like off brand mozzarella from a grocery store, and the sauce was okay.

The reason that I give it a 2 out of 5 is because the pizza itself was rather expensive.  A 2 topping large was 20.93 with tax.  Definitely not worth the money.  I'd give a 2.5 out of 5, but since Yelp doesn't allow us to give haves, I gotta round down.

However, if you're craving pizza and don't feel like driving, this place will do in a pinch."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,If you like ok pizza your in for a treat!  It's a bit pricey and I sometimes yearn for the days of real pizza but if your looking for better than Dominos or Pizza Hut and a decent salad this is the place.  Just get your salad via pickup so you can visit the salad bar.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,Last weekend was my first time coming to this location. I was craving pepperoni and pineapple pizza and Rusty's definitely satisifed my craving! Very clean inside and staff was friendly. We got our pizza quick and all of the vegetables were fresh at the salad bar. Great place to hangout and watch sports since they have multiple televisions.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I normally LOVE coming to Rusty's, what can I say, the pizza is good. But this bad experience has really made me not want to come back. It all started when I asked for a ranch cup. A young woman (who I didn't catch her name) with sandy brown hair was on her phone while her other two coworkers were hard at work. I asked her since she wasn't busy and she simply rolled her eyes and lazily walked over to give me a cup. After, a family, who had been waiting for over 20 minutes for their pizza were shocked to see their pizza fall off the oven (all the while, the woman I had asked for ranch was still on her phone, basically she saw the pizza about to reach the end of the assembly line and did NOTHING to stop the pizza from falling). When the one employee who was actually working realized the pizza fell, the family asked for their refund and proceeded to scorn him. Basically, it could have all been resolved if only the young woman had put down her phone for like one minute to help out her coworker. I am shocked to say the least. And my own pizza didn't get to me until like 25 minutes after I had ordered which was completely ridiculous seeing as it was an individual pizza. The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is simply because the food was good. But the service was horrific"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"The pizza here is acceptable. The portions are good. Very expensive for what you get.

Delivery guy nearly ran me over in his blue toyota celica; waved his hand at me and kept going. He almost hit another couple with his car but dodged and just kept going. I wanted to tell management but hearing the types of jokes coming from the back I get the feeling that they condone this type of reckless behavior."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"Deserves a 4.5.

This has been on my restaurant 'to eat' list for at least 2 years now, and I finally did it. Their pizzas are the best I've ever had (!!!) and their wings are decent. The place itself is interesting--must have once been a bank, pretty cool on the inside. You order the food and then they call out your name, so not much can be said about the service. 

For the best pizza I've ever had, I guess the price was befitting (more than Dominos, less than Woodstock's). Will definitely be returning!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,Got hot wings on Sunday and still have food poisoning one week later. HORRIBLE! Never again
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"The thing about Rusty's is you will either love them like I do, or not care too much for them. Its weird, but true. But here is the good thing about Rusty's:

1. You can CUSTOMIZE your pizza ANY WAY YOU WANT!  Left side, right side, different styles, it's great!  My BF is allergic to diary ( i know right), so he gets the right side of his pizza w/o cheese, tons of veggies, jalapenos and he order his sliced extra cut. I get my side of the pizza cooked well done, with cheese and tons of random toppings. 

2. You can order ONLINE or CALL, or PICK UP! Options are good.

3. Their food is delicious and toppings are fresh! Unique combos! 

4. TWO BEST: DIABLO FUEGO: Heaven on earth!!!! Hot, spicy, and sweet. Dude. green chiles, chorizo, Canadian Style Bacon, pepperoni, fresh onion, fresh tomato, black olives, and get it with Pineapple!  
 BBQ CHICKEN: tangy bbq sauce, bbq chicken & red onions, four cheeses, garnished with fresh cilantro. Got get it with CASHEWS!!!!

Also, I recommend ordering pizzas WELL DONE for crispy fun-ness! Get it Thin crust, it just tastes way better for some reason too.

Their small 10 inch is big enough to split (3 small but heavy slices each), but I hope you have a bomb dessert waiting for you somewhere at home. If not, you better order up a size.

I don't think Woodstock's in IV is better than Rusty's or vice versa, they are two completely different animals. Both deserve some love!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"Awesome place that has been my go to for a quick Goleta pizza for 20+ years! They are consistent, open late, and they make mouthwatering pizzas, which is saying a lot from a person who has spent years of his life living in Italy (although I put American style pizza like Rusty's in a different category than Italian style pizza).

The inside is super cool, it has great old school video games and areas (including an old bank vault) that are awesome for gatherings. The staff have never been anything but prompt, professional, and helpful, although they could use to clean their bathrooms more regularly throughout the day.

A crucial note:
- Make sure to order your pizza with ""white cheese only!"" I have always found it strange that they mix in cheddar or some other yellow cheese with their mozzarella.

I find many of the negative reviews below baffling, this place has always been awesome and one of my Goleta favorites since I was a little kid and I know I am not alone.

Keep doing what you're doing Rusty's! Goleta and Santa Barbara love you!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I was passing thru the area on a business trip and I stopped here for a quick lunch since it was right off the freeway.  Quick look at the menu and I order their ""Quick Lunch"" special.  Personal 2 topping pizza, one trip salad bar and small drink for 7 bucks.  Not too bad.  Salad bar is fresh and has a nice variety to choose from. Grabbed what I wanted from the salad bar and in about 10 mins or so my pizza was ready.  Pepperoni and mushroom.  Nice thin crust and crunchy and the ingredients were fresh.  Not the best pizza I've had but at the same time it's not the worst.  Definitely better than Pizza Hut or Domino's.  

I would go back again if I'm in the area again."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"We came with a large group of loud junior high aged kids. When we walked through the door I saw the staff kinda stiffen and look at us like ""oh great."" I immediately googled what time they close because they overtly seemed bothered. The guy sweeping the floor literally stopped sweeping and just walked past us. It was almost 9... they close at midnight. Not sure why no one greeted us. Okay, maybe they were ready to close i don't know. Anyway, we got our pizzas and the rambunctious children were so happy. They also enjoyed pretending to play the games they had available. All the Parmesan and hot pepper flakes were missing from all the tables. I had to lean over the counter to get them. If the cheese is all clumpy it should be tossed out.. one of the shakers had an interesting taste to it. When we were getting ready to leave I reminded the wild ones to throw their trash away. We left and got no good bye. Pizza was yummy! Weird how there was not one ice cube in the soda machine though."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,As of 2/6/21 Rusty's has made the worst decision and had the nerve to deliver a paper thin crust to my house. Even in this pandemic I will drive to Toppers Pizza in Ventura or even order Domino's before I give your cheating a$% another dime shame on you!!!
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"After a long day at the beach, none of us were in the mood for eating out before heading to State Street for the night, so pizza it was!  This particular location of Rusty's Pizza is located about 5 minutes from the house where I grew up.  So I remember always coming here on Friday nights for pizza and to play video games.  The building used to be a bank, so one of the rooms is actually the old vault which is kind of cool for children's birthday parties and what not.  

We ordered two large pizzas for everyone to munch on while they pre-partied.  One was my request, thin crust with pepperoni and jalapenos.  The other was the birthday boy's request, pan crust with pepperoni and meatballs.  Yea, I said MEATBALLS!  No dinky pieces of sausage here, just big fatty meatballs, yummm.  They also have a great salad bar and really good, thick cut potato wedges that you can add to your order.    

I know some people think that Rusty's is somewhat pricey, especially when other chain pizza restaurants offer $5 Medium pizzas.  But you can really taste the difference in quality, and I think it's definitely worth the extra couple of bucks.  Their website usually has a couple coupons too if you want to take advantage of those.  

I love Rusty's Pizza Parlor because it's simply one of the great things about living in Santa Barbara.  Three stars for the nostalgic factor that gets me every time :)"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"We went here yesterday for lunch and we all (4) had the lunch special which was a personal 2 topping pizza and a small salad from the salad bar which looked and tasted great. The lady at the counter was friendly and the price was good. We ate our salads and by the time we finished our pizzas were ready. I didn't have s problem with my pizza but the reason for the 1 star was for my friends pizza which had human hair baked in it and on the bottom of it. And I don't mean an eyelash, I mean 4-5 pieces of head hair 3"" long. My first and last time there."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,I came to this location with a party of 14. The food was good but the service was terrible. The manager on duty had horrible customer service skills. One family in our group never received their pizza and the manager said they did. He could have walked to our table and count how many pizzas we had instead of calling the person in our group a liar. He clearly gave the wrong table the pizza but he could not admit that. I will never go to that location again.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Ordered med ""Rusty's special"" and small cheesy bread for delivery.. what was received was a VERY crispy (basically BURNT) cheesy bread and pizza. ""fresh bell peppers"" were burnt to unrecognizable black strips. Called Rusty's hotline, and was told to ""send a picture"". They were nice enough to send a ""replacement"" Pizza and cheesy bread... but what arrived was ANOTHER overly baked pizza and cheesy bread. At this point, I was hungry and didnt want to go through the hassle of calling again.
What happened to the good quality pizza, rusty?!?! Very disappointed and will never order again. Im sticking with dominos or Papa Johns."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"We were craving pizza, but were a little skeptical about ordering from here due to reviews. However, we ordered online and the pizza got to our door exactly as we ordered less than half an hour after we placed it! It tasted great, and came with all the little fixings I asked for. It's pizza, and is just as satisfying as pizza should be. Thanks, Rustys! We'll definitely order from here again!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"This my favorite pizza spot it the town! We always order pizzas with the same fillings (plain cheese for kids and chicken+mushrooms+onion+olives), and super star - bbq chicken wings! So delicious, btw the taste never changed so far! I love it!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"My girlfriend and I order from here very often, we love Rusty's! Out of the dozens of pizzas we've ordered we've only been disappointed twice. Staff can be a little rude sometimes"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,Poor customer service. We were actually going to go to the taco shop next door but decided to eat pizza. Fist time in this place and they talk to you like your dumb. Sorry for not knowing your menu and sorry for asking questions.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,This place reminds me of what pizza hut used to be. I love the CNN blasting and the atmosphere is always chill.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"This is my first ever Yelp review...I've never felt the need to leave a negative review about anything before, but the interaction I had recently has stuck with me enough that I thought I'd share. My friends and I have ordered pizza from this location on many occasions. Everyone we've interacted with in the past has always been friendly, and we always made sure to tip our delivery drivers well, etc.

My last (and final) interaction with this location was perhaps the worst customer service interaction I've ever had. We waited for over an hour for a pizza that never came. When we called to check on it, the ""supervisor"" (he said he was) said that the delivery driver arrived but couldn't contact us bc we didn't put in the right phone number...okay, fair enough...oops our bad. However, it struck me as weird when he read the number because I had literally never heard the number in my life, and it wasn't even close to the correct phone number (so it seemed weird that we would have mistakenly entered that number). Plus the phone number on our confirmation email was correct. My concern was that perhaps he was looking at the wrong order or something. When I tried to explain/clarify this with him he yelled at me for ""interrupting him."" I apologized and said I would wait until he was done, but he (in an extremely rude tone) just tried to push ahead with sending out another pizza without hearing me out or further confirming that he had the right order/information. When I tried to pause the interaction again, just to clarify the situation/make sure I was getting the right order, he yelled at me again, and then hung up.

To be honest, I don't really care about the mistake (it probably was indeed our fault somehow, and after clarifying, I'd have been happy to apologize and tip the driver extra). But the way the ""supervisor"" talked to me was really messed up. This interaction was not only the worst customer service interaction I've ever had, but one of the most rude, anger-filled, disrespectful, interactions I've had with a human being period...all for just trying to clarify some pizza delivery details lol. Definitely won't be returning with my business."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Great pizza but horrible customer service. Cashier didn't bother to greet me or give me eye contact as I ordered. The tables needed to be wiped down.  
I rather eat at the Santa Barbara location."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"walked in to an almost completely empty store at 2 in the afternoon, no one in line, 3~ employees working. Stood at the counter for about 3-4 minutes and watched them clean their meat cutter and make multiple trips to the back without even a simple ""Hello"" or ""Ill be right with you"" just annoyed glares and no recognition like we weren't even there, or maybe even didnt want us there? Surprised at the lack of service, we left and got food somewhere else. I should/could have gotten my order taken and food ready in the time that we spent waiting for simple acknowledgement. Must be one dirty meat cutter... Get some new staff."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"Rudy's Storke Rd. is your classic pizza place.  The booths are comfortable and there is a TV to keep track of sports/news.  
The women who chef during the lunch hours (when I eat here) are rock stars.  Everything tastes perfect and arrives fast.  Portions are, as always at Rusty's, generous.  
Salad bar is fresh and inviting.   If you want take out or a chance to play an arcade style video game; they got that too."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I tried ordering and I order for business partners, family, and friends on a daily basis. Probably around $1,000/mo. Tonight they declined to allow me to order because they didn't feel like delivering and their driver was sick. I won't be back not one more time. Disgusting"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,I wish I could hav taken a picture of our pizza. We got half cheese and half veggie. It was so delicious!!! I have a very picky 8 year old and let's just say he wanted more pizza again the next day for lunch. We are here just visiting Santa Barbara for a few days and finding this great pizza place was a huge plus! Glad we found our pizza place for when we visit SB.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"This should be 0 stars instead of 1 star.  I got a dried out pizza the last time we ordered from Rusty's in Goleta.  We thought it might have just been a fluke, so we decided to try them again.  I called and picked up at exactly the right time, but the pizza was all dried out again even worse that the first time we ordered 2 weeks earlier.  The crust like cardboard, and the pizza all dried out like it had been sitting overnight. 
I don't know if they are overcooking their pizza, or cooking ahead and serving old pizza, but this is the last time I will order pizza from them.  I even called their main number and complained, but no one seemed to even take me seriously."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,This review is mostly in regards to their pizza. Their pan crust pizza is amazing! We got a large Meat Mania and it was fluffy and delicious. The staff were friendly too.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Came to get a quick salad bar. I realize it's a pizza joint and know it's probably not the best food and that's ok. Im writing this review due to the TERRIBLE customer service! The guys taking our order was very rude and acted as if we were bothering him by placing  an order..... here is the best part, he handed us these small plastic forks to eat our salad with. When we asked if they had any real forks he told us ""they are all dirty""!!! We asked if he could maybe wash a  couple...‍‍Not sure why they are paying the five people behind the counter!! Don't waste your time coming here"

xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"I love RUSTY's!!! It's the best pizza ever!!! Well, for me that is. I only eat Rusty's pizza. 
I only have one hang up. On Valentine's I ordered a bunch of heart shaped pizzas, among those, a few veggie pizzas. And they came with pepperoni. 
In the description it doesn't say they are outlined in pepperoni, so when I call and ask for veggie pizzas, you would think that operator would 1) inform me that it has pepperoni, or 2) would be smart enough that a veggie pizza should not have meat on it. My vegetarian. Friends had to go without until I arrived and called Rusty's to ask them to resend those veggie pizzas. Instead of getting an apology, I was schooled on how those pizzas come with pepperoni, and I should have requested them without pepperoni. I asked myself, ""How clueless Can you be, if I ask for a vegetarian pizza, WHY WOULD YOU ADD MEAT!!!!""
That is all!! I hope next year the description or pepperoni Info is added to the coupon or ad.

Thanks for responding so quickly"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"So keeping this short, epic fail and way too much attitude from customer service.I had a pizza delivered wrong for the second time and received a most disgusting conversation with a woman claiming Rusty's was in the right!!! All that I wanted was a Chicago style pan pizza, not serious attitude from someone from customer service?? This woman made me feel like I had imposed her and Rusty's corp till the bitter end. My pizza was wrong for the second time, and all that I had asked for was the delivery guy to pick my pizza up and receive my money back... Not an option at ALL!!! I would have to wait till tomorrow for a call back from corporate????!!!! Pizza is not bad, service is horrible, the worst, seriously the worst I have delt with ever, seriously ever!!!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"On Saturday after a round of golf, I along with my father and brother found our way into Rusty's close to the golf course. We've been hearing good things about the restaurant, so my brother ordered a personal small plain cheese pizza and my Dad and I ordered a medium sausage and mushroom pizza. The pizza my Dad and I ordered was cooked on a perforated pan (which is a shortcut to getting a good crust) and it was really cooked unevenly. And another thing: The pizza my brother ordered was so small, it was just about the size of one slice and the pizza my Dad and I ordered wasn't enough for one person, let alone two people. In short, we were not very impressed with Rusty's, we had better pizza at ""Pizza My Heart"" and even ""Round Table"" pizza was superior. We won't be going back to Rusty's anytime soon."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,"Not sure why this place has so low stars, but my second experience here were excellent!!! I have ordered 2 top pizzas with thin and thick crust, mushroom with bell peppers (the yammiest) and thin chorizo w onions. OMG, even I am not really big pizza person, but they made me addicted!! So fresh and delicious, mouthwatering. My order was ready in 10-12 min. 
The place also looks clean, neat and organised. Keep it up, guys! Great place!!My favourite pizza place!!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I ordered a Large Rusty's  Special on New Years Eve and  paid $27 plus $10 tip. When they delivered I received a Large Pepperoni instead. 

When I called back to let the store know they got my order wrong and if I could be compensated somehow they said no Compensation. I was shocked! Horrible customer service. I asked to speak to the manager and the person said he was the supervisor ( wouldn't give me a name but gave me his ID # 1058) when I asked for his name again he said he was not required to give me that information. 

I asked him what can he do to rectify the mistake and he told me that he could have the driver pick up the pizza and make a new one then deliver it again. I told the supervisor I did not want to wait another hour, I would be ok with taking the pepperoni but at least refund me the difference for what  I paid. He also said he could not do that. 

I am really disappointed in how this situation was handled. I've worked in the hospitality industry for 12 years as a Front Office Manager here in Santa Barbara and to say the least I am very disappointed in how this supervisor handled the situation.  The least he could have done was offer a discount or something for my next order. I will NOT be recommending Rusty's to any of my friends or guests that visit Santa Barbara. What a horrendous unprofessional experience."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,positive,Best pizza around. If you say you dont like rustys you don't know what good fresh pizza is. If you don't love it your  not a local and your opinion really dont matter. Trust the locals! no its not the cheap ish you have been raised on.
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"I have been ordering Rustys pizzas from Storke Rd for at least 15 years and today was the first time that I'm sad and disappointed that I specifically asked for well done pizza and what was in the pizza box was not what I asked for!

xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Experienced the worst lunch time customer service ever at this location.
I walked in stood at the counter reviewing the menu. There were two ladies in the prep area. One was arranging the order tickets and one was making the orders, and not at the most sense of urgency pace.
The lady arranging the orders looked up and we made eye contact and I smiled and she quickly broke our gaze and went back to arranging the tickets. 
Then, another 2 employees come from the back following another gentleman who was in street clothes and cap and out the door to look at his car. As they were walking out, the lady employee says (in Spanish -   we'll be back we're going to look at his car. I understand Spanish - maybe they thought I wouldn't catch on) to the lady STILL arranging the tickets. 
I noticed 2 customers waiting patiently for their lunch orders. 
At that point, i decided to leave. I work at UCSB and had to STILL get lunch and back to campus. I was carving a pizza and salad, too. Oh, well I ended up at the golden arches to get my lunch.
Needless to say, I probably will not be returning to that location. It was poorly staffed for the lunch time when people have a limited time for lunch and the staff was more concerned about other things rather than taking care of their customers."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Figured since we were in the area, we would order in person and take it to go so it would be faster than ordering delivery. Ended up standing there for well over an hour to get a simple large pizza with 2 toppings. Would not recommend ever ordering in person."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Super bummed on this spot.  It's not a question of the food being bad.  In fact, the pizza was good.  Thin crust, with zingy marinara.  Sausage was really low quality.  

Shakey's ( one of my faves because of Mojos & Chicken) has kind of the same pizza sauce / marinara as Rusty's. 

The restaurant was fairly dirty.  Location is a vacated bank with a safe and teller windows.  Salad bar sucks: Iceberg, fake bacon bits -- Carl's Jr has them beat hands down on the salad bar. When you charge $25 for a Meat Lovers, you expect better ingredients.  Wish this establishment could up its game."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"This place used to be one of my favorite. I am disappointed with what they delivered today. I ordered a large pizza with pineapple and onion toppings. Guess what, onions were all burnt. I called them and told about this, store manager happily replaced the order. Guess what, onions were burnt again. Called them and the guy tells me that onions are so thin that they will burn...What?? This was not my first order and No onions were burnt in my earlier order. This may very well be my last order. Listen to your customer, try to figure out what went wrong.."

We sent a private message on your online contact form, never got a response hopefully this review helps other people. Just thinking about this still makes me sick to my stomach. We found TWO hairs in our pizza. Not ONE but TWO! One was stuck in the pizza box it was a long blondish hair. The second one was noticed by my husband on the slice I was about to eat. The second hair was imbedded into the pizza dough, it was cooked inside we were able to pull it out and it was clearly a hair from a male. We tossed out the whole pizza. I'm very disappointed in this location it was always one of my favorites."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Greetings Rusty's Pizza!

We are giving you all a 1 star due to on line and phone ordering.

If we we actually drive to one of Rusty's Pizzarias, we would have given you all 5 stars as a pizza restaurant...

Please read below...tried emailing you all multiple times on your website contacts click on your website but, it came back undeliverable multiple times...so here we are on yelp...we apologize but, you all truly need to up your efforts on your website!

We love the pizza and salads you all produce and deliver!

That being said, your website (probably because of crappy server equipment and/or IT support) pretty much sucks. Your website takes so long to  stop buffering or what ever the correct term is...it takes so long to try and order, we stop the online ordering and hope we get in to your call center.  Your website speed is extremely slow and at best, choppy. This may be why your call center is so slow to answer...

Again, we have been a very loyal customer for years! Since back in the '70's!  But at this point, if you don't upgrade your online ordering system AND your call center, we will most likely start ordering from one of your competitors.  We do not want to go that route out of loyalty but, your web site and call in center are leaving us no choice!

My family, extended family and I truly hope that you all can continue to make and deliver some of the best pizzas, subs and salads in our cities and county!

With much love and appreciation,

xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"We visited the Rustys on Storke Rd on Saturday and we were treated very badly. Our party of 7 ordered about $100 in food and drinks and our order was not correct. Our name was not called when it was done so it sat there until we realized it. When we got back to the table and realized 2 pizzas were missing I went back up to the counter with my receipt and kindly said ""We are missing two pizzas. I also don't see them on my receipt tho"" the girl behind the counter proceeded to tell me I hadn't ordered those pizzas and got very rude very quickly. I stated if I didn't order the 4 individual pizzas why would u have asked me if I wanted thin or thick crust on all of them? Instead of just saying well let's get those other two started for you she proceeded to argue the fact with me until I asked ""Are you really arguing and telling me what I ordered?"" ""I am the customer and would like to order the two more pizzas now"" She continued to belittle me and tell me I was rude since I walked in and that's why she's treating me this way. Btw When we entered I had everyone sit down and we got settled so that I, one person could go place the order and not have any chaos. I had told her I'll make this easy and I would be back with the order and she laughed and said ok. I have never been treated this bad in any establishment and I'm usually the one to coordinate most meals for our teams and do the ordering, however thank God there were just a few of us that went this time. I really just wanted to leave but I had 2 children waiting for there pizza and just needed to place my order. She begrudgingly took my order and then I asked for a managers name and she said I'm not giving that to you, you can use the call center. Then I said what is your name and she would not give me that either. I then asked another employee behind the counter and he turned away and wouldn't speak at all. I returned to my table and couldn't eat a thing I was so upset! I got on the Rustys website and used the contact form to file a complaint and it is now Thursday and I haven't heard a word:( I want to point out we visited the Rustys on Hollister in the Vons center the very next day because the team won the championship and that's what they wanted to do so I was hesitant but said let's try a different location. We were very nicely treated, it was clean, didn't have employees taking naps in the booths as I forgot to mention was also something at Storke location and the pizza was a totally different quality. Much better! I have my receipts and I'm not going to blast the girls employee number socially but I would like to be contacted, compensated and know that this employee is reprimanded. I don't believe that this is the type of person Rustys corporate would like representing their establishment at all!"

Pretty damn good pizza, it wasn't cheap, $47 for two large pizzas (gave the guy a $10 tip, so i'm not a cheap a$$) but that's the price you pay for ordering pizzas at a campground. Thanks Rusty's!!!!"
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Passable pizza when you're feeling too drunk/tired/lazy to feed yourself, plus delivery is almost always an option.

xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"Yelp is forcing me to give at least one star in order to be able to post a review. But the don't deserve any stars! The large cheese pizza we ordered was burned. I don't even understand how it could have been put into a box and sent out for delivery?? Obviously there is NO QUALITY CONTROL. The other two pizzas were overdone as well. Not burned, but definitely over done... We spent $70 on crappy overdone / burned pizza and waited over an hour for delivery. Called the store and the supervisor was willing to rush us a replacement cheese pizza. The replacement arrived 45 min later. It was not as overdone as the first one, but still just crappy pizza."
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,The delivery is horrible is not customer service it all the deliver coming bad mood an knock my window mi dogs is crazy he say he knock the door that's not true any ways..... you guys lost customers..... hopefully fixed this little things !!!!!
xwSWtJcQkzTF6HNm_IMgcg,Rusty's Pizza Parlor,Italian,negative,"This is okay.  Pizza is okay quality and taste.  Atmosphere and service was nothing spectacular or anything terrible either.  

On a negative note, I did find a black hair baked into the crust in a pizza slice.  I brought it to their attention, but they did not offer any future coupons for our inconvenience.  I will not be returning."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"So happy there is a family friendly place to watch football in Carp! Great atmosphere, fast service, delicious pizza."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,I was really good pizza and wings. I would definitely come back. We came with kids and it was ok. I guess it depends on what you have in mind for the atmosphere. There's a lot of tvs so with kids it can be distracting but that's what people are there for to watch a game and eat pizza. Overall good and definitely good food.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,Average pizza. Nice garden salad. Was ok but wouldn't do it again. Nothing special. Crust ok but not thin like advertised.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Decent salad bar but served in ancient wooden bowls, and the pizza is very bland. The almost non existent sauce had no flavor!    On a good note -It is very kid friendly and  the soda machine gives many choices."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"I travel from Ventura to Santa Barbara on Saturdays and have some time to kill - watching football and eating lunch.  This place has a great setup for sports nuts to watch games on tv.  Unfortunately, they have no one working there that knows how to work the tv remotes.  The food is good, the service is good and they have a great atmosphere for watching sports but... how about training someone to mange all those flat screen tvs?  Very maddening to be watching CNN and last weeks pro game on a college football filled Saturday afternoon!!!!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Love this place! I used to live in ventura and fell in love with Pizza Man Dans there - SO I was thrilled to find out one opened here in carp! Ya gotta give it to Dan; he works his butt off and I love seeing the management hustle along side their employees.  The employees are always smiling and I love to see people who are genuinely happy at work.  I love the new atmosphere and my boyfriend LOVES the tvs, great place to come have a beer and enjoy some sports.  

The goods:
LOTS of televisions
Good pizza
Good boneless wings
More options than other pizza joints

Something I would like to see, is a better wine menu - but they do have great beer options!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"I love the Fiesta Pizza, It was very tasty and loaded with toppings. Salad Bar is like unique accessory to the location, it is the center of attention as soon as you walk in. What about those big screens TV's, you just need to say WOW!!!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Web site was easy to use to place our order.  We are from out of town and found them on Yelp.  Our order was delivered in half the time what they indicated.  And, the pizza tasted great!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Pretty good pizza!! Nice menu - I'd like to try a sub next time because they sound delicious.  Ordered two pies - a Taco pizza and a Hawaiian and they were good.  Ordered the thin crust and it's a thin, crisp crust.  This place is generous with their toppings.  They have a well appointed salad bar inside too."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Wow! This place has one of the biggest salad bars I've ever seen.  Plus it has soup, a bunch of TVs and funky stuff on the wall.  As always good  pizza, and I split a GREAT meatball sandwich with my friend."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"The most delicious pizza in Carpinteria!  The staff is friendly - Ray will ring you up with a smile.  Chela will make the most delicious food.  And Maria keeps it all in order.  

This is hands down the best place and we have become regulars here!  Rusty's is ok, but too expensive, Giovanni's doesn't have quite the umph.  This place is delicious - the turkey sub is usually my hubby's fav.  

If you pick it up and check-in you can get free food after a certain number of visits.  And if you join their text phone number deal, you can get specials like a $5 calzone.  Or sometimes pizza and wings for $19.99.  Now they deliver beer and wine, if that's your thing.

The wings are really good, pizza is excellent.  The salad bar is good, but I don't like the delivery salad."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Great food, people and atmosphere. The pizza is on point. The people work hard so you will like what you get. And the indoors is great, with cool memorable and amazing TV setup."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,40 bucks for 2 sub par medium pizzas. The delivery guy didn't come to our house so we had to walk to the end of the block and buy our shitty pizzas.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Let me start off with a simple but strong OMG! 
The pizza was delicious, staff were friendly and the restaurant appeared clean. We stayed nearby at Carpentaria beach and stayed in our travel trailer, we walked to Smart & Final for some supplies and walked by Pizzaman Dan's and decided to order a pizza and pick it up on our way back. Medium pepperoni was $18 but feeds 2-3 people about 8 slices. Definitely the best I've had in a long time! Eat here, you will be pleased!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Went in for lunch, and wow what a salad bar. Easily the best in town. We will be back."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Fun that this is open late for hungry people after the brewery closes. Anything you want is here
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"I don't like leaving poor reviews for restaurants, but unfortunately this location deserves one. 

You walk in and the only menu you can order from is a folded-up takeout menu that was somewhat greasy from previous patrons. The cashiers were cordial, but problems with the order either fell upon the cashiers taking the order incorrectly or staff making food improperly. 

I had multiple people in my party order everything from pizza to sandwiches to the wings and nothing was up to par. We were asked what sauce we wanted on the wings, but when the ""wings"" were served, they gave no sauce. When we asked them to fix it, we were given a dipping cup.

The sandwich was properly made, but it was somewhat undercooked and fell apart after the first bite. That could be the mark of a juicy sandwich, but in this case it was just shoddily put together.

The pizza itself was passable, but not terribly great for a namesake dish. The one silver lining had to be the drink machine, which really shouldn't ever be a silver lining for any situation.

The rest of the atmosphere was fine, if a little strange. There were an abundance of large TVs, but you would think at least one of them would be in Full HD (they aren't). The sliding glass door is always open, but I'm not sure why it was needed to begin with.

I don't know, it just seems like this whole restaurant just won't be worth most people's time. Yes, it really is that bad. Yes, you will probably regret it. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that's the way Dan cooks his pizza."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"We ordered PizzaMan Dans for delivery last night. We got the veggie pizza and added sausage, pineapple, pepperoni, and anchovies on the side for my husband. It was delicious, fresh, and cooked perfectly! The crust was crispy and not greasy at all. The veggies and toppings were excellent too. I would recommend it to family and friends and we will definitely be ordering again from this restaurant."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"I am not a pizza Connoisseur or anything but, wow. I thought that pizza was supposed to be cooked in a pizza oven or on a pizza stone, but the pizza I have tasted has been so salty that it tasted like it was cooked on a Himalayan salt block with extra salt. I do enjoy salty foods but when you can barely taste anything else it is disappointing. I'm trying to give the place a chance since I enjoy the freshness and selection in the salad bar, so even though the pizza is expensive for what you get,I have tried 5 different combinations of pizza there. Unfortunately the pizza has been salty every time."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Probably the best delivery type pizza you can get in Carp, but as far as eating at the location, they dropped the ball on a few really annoying aspects. 

First, they have a bunch of games for kids to play, (which is good) but they have no ATM and they don't give any cash back on your debit card?! (Not good) 

Second, they don't allow you to tip on your CC purchase?! Very poor move for the staff.

So you can't get cash at the location, but you can only tip in cash?! Makes no sense for a family pizza place on the main drag in Carpinteria. 

Soooo, if you decide to come, bring cash or DON'T bring kids, and I guess plan on not tipping...


UPDATE: After posting this review, the policy was changed! Bumping to 5 stars!! Thanks for actually listening and fixing the issue!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,I believe that pizza is a personal preference so when I say the pizza is really good l know that there will be others who disagree.  But I like it all the same.  The salad bar is well stocked and various ingredients look fresh.  The restaurant itself has always looked neat and clean.  They also have free wifi so that's a plus as far as I am concerned.  The only thing I don't like about this particular restaurant is its location.  This particular strip mall location is extremely busy and very difficult to get in and out of. Anyway... there you hit
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Pizza Man Dans replaced Tony's with new building and fixtures but, not much to say about their food or staff. Tony's Restaurant building was old and needed a lot of work but, it was the food and the best servers that kept it going. Pizza Man Dan sure could use great staff like Carrie, Natalie & Krista. Won't go back I can get a pizza like that anywhere and I can do without a staff that does not smile or greet you."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Good pizza!   Went there twice during a recent trip and was not disappointed.   Nice old school salad bar too.  Beer and wine selection is pretty limited but good enough.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"PizzaMan Dan's is a welcome addition in Carpinteria.  They did an incredible job on doing the Extreme Makeover of that building and love the Corvette dressed up like a pizza parked out front, nice touch!  We ordered delivery service and they were on time with the pizza.  It was very tasty; however, 2 things come to mind they may want to improve on:  1.  the crust was not cooked - a bit soggy, and 2. the tomato sauce had too much of a sweet taste for our palates.  

We wish them continued success."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"I really enjoy their salad bar and their pizzas have been very good . We like coming here to watch sports , they have tvs everywhere. Great place to have a fresh salad and pizza."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"I have been eating here 2-3x per week since they opened. Why? They are open late, guaranteed to have the game on, have beer towers, and the food is pretty good: that plus they have a salad bar. - FOR THAT, thank you PMD's... but I have to say, your customer service here is very hit and miss, and your calzones are VERY disappointing.  

I had just spent $65 on a beer tower, an appetizer, 2x salad bars, and 2x calzones. I came in around 10:15.... Started in on the beer and salad as usual, and the boneless wings came out just fine. I was quickly scolded and told I should have paid 50¢ extra when I asked for an additional marinara sauce... kind of bold after spending over $60+ for two people at a pizza bar. Then my ""custom calzone"" came out  ... just awful. First, I was told that all calzones have marinara sauce (in them) - mine came out with no sauce. Secondly, this was a depressing excuses for a calzone- it came out made of practically all cheese - it only had m one tiny piece of ham. 

I had attempted to add onion and peppers to a the Hawaiian Calzone, but was told it was impossible, and ordered a custom ham, pineapple, onion, and pepper calzone. It essentially came with zero meat, zero onion, zero peppers, and no sauce inside. - good thing I asked for that 50¢ marinara earlier! 

The icing on the cake, and the only thing I really cared about was how rude they were to me at 11:05 pm when I was finishing up my beer tower and calzone. I was told (IN A VERY RUDE TONE), by the Manager ""You have five mins to leave."" - Keep in mind they close at 11. I stated: ""it's 11:05, you close at 11:00... couldn't I have come in and ordered food 8 or 9 mins ago?"" She said ""Yes, you could have ordered to go. You could not have eaten here. We have places to be too you know."" 
I run a non-profit service-based company and if I told a client that I had places to be because their event went 5-10 mins over, my company would no longer exist. 

The FINAL STRAW was when I mentioned my calzone that was nothing but cheese and pineapple on the way out. She said ""well, you should have mentioned something before eating it all. It's your fault for not saying something."" As if I was looking for a refund. I simply was informing her about the unusually low quality of food. Instead, I got attitude once more. 

Bottom line, expect to fend for yourself and get poor customer service (unless it's late night and this one bald guy is working ... apologies for forgetting his name, but he is awesome and takes care of everybody!) And do NOT order calzones, they are sub par. Oh and lastly, DO NOT expect to be treated with kindness after 11:00 pm."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"So I came here for Sunday football, and the manger Maria was awful. I had asked 3 times if she could change the TV's for the 1 o'clock games. She was asked (by numerous people) to change the games she got defensive and made excuses as to why she couldn't. When she finally did change a few TV's, she refused to change quite a few others with several games that weren't on any TV.... They advertise on Sunday ticket but they can't seem to make that happen! 
Came in again 2 weeks later (thinking maybe it was just a bad day)on a Saturday. Several dirty tables and several employees just standing talking in back.  I asked to watch a few college games and I asked  Maria if she could change a few TV's (it wasn't busy my group of 3 and 2 other tables). She came out like she was going to change them (remote in hand)even asked what games we wanted. But never changed anything, and walked away.  Seems to me there are too idle employees."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Pizza was really good and they loaded it with toppings! Great lunch combo with a salad, drink, and pizza for under $10.

Food quality was good and portions were a good value. There is ample parking in the rear of the location.

This place is a good alternative to Rustys!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Great selection of dishes, super nice staff, average food taste/quality.    While you won't go wild, you won't be disappointed either.


Best of all, they deliver!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,I agree with the comments about the new look.  Nice environment.  Thought I'd try the pastrami sandwich.  Yuck!  I don't know what they're using for meat but they have a lot of courage calling it pastrami.  Just terrible.  Couldn't finish it.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"So I'm assuming this is an off-shoot of Rusty's Pizza..

While Rusty's isn't my absolute favorite pizza joint in the world, it certainly deserves its recognition. However, the minute things that keep me from ordering Rusty's more frequently are NOTICEABLY fixed here. Dan is definitely not stingy with the toppings, and I found the toppings had more flavor. The crust itself is softer and better prepared, and I find the pizza is slightly less greasy. 

The joint itself is also very sleek and stylish. Now don't go in expecting an overhaul; the prices are the same but you do get more for your dollar here at Pizza Man Dan's. The pizza I ordered was quite delicious and I will be coming back again.

Thanks Dan!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Wow ! Awesome job. My order was correct, delivery was super fast- actually earlier than said time. Small pizza bacon, pepperoni, pizza and a cinnamon pizza, it all taste great. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Enjoy it... great location... friendly staff... and great pizza and meal deals... they even let us have our Jr Warriors meeting there... big thank you to them...
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,We really enjoy the food here. Being unable to leave the house due to surgery. Wish your Carpinteria location delivered.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,There is no good reason this place has 3.5 stars. The pizza and salad are good.. close to the beach and staff were friendly. Don't let the reviews of other places deter you from trying this one.. perfectly good
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Newly remodeled and clean.  Pizza man Dan's in Carpenteria has an extensive, fresh, salad bar and offers lunch specials.  We also had the deep dish cheese pizza and it was a really good pizza.  The thinner crust that they offer was decent but couldn't compare to the deep dish.  Yum!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Best pizza place in Sabra Barbara area. Love every pizza that I have had there and the place is always clean. Fun to watch sports and hangout too. Lastly, love that it's in Carp a perfect restaurant for our small town."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"I just wanna give a huge shoutout to my boy Daniel, he is the VIP. Well done Daniel Motel 6 salutes you"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Fast service, great thin crust pizza , loaded with your choice of toppings . No gourmet toppings but a good old fashion pizza. Sadly did not come with serving spatula, made dispursing difficult  using plastic knife.Salad bar has a nice variety of toppings and romaine lettuce. Salad bar needs a staff to keep it stocked, especially when busy. Atmosphere family friendly large tables indoor, outdoor courtyard or dine in open patio room."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Wow ! Awesome job. My order was correct, delivery was super fast- actually earlier than said time. Small pizza bacon, pepperoni, pizza and a cinnamon pizza, it all taste great. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Just got back to town for work today, really thinking about ordering some awesome pizza, but last time my order was incorrect. I just put in a order for dinner and asked to be comped for a $5 item that was not correct before and was denied any compensation. Very disappointed with customer service."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Great pizza with tasty crust and kid-friendly atmosphere. Clean and new looking restaurant. Great patios and open seating inside. A TON of TVs!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Really cute place I have had two visits and both times the food was great and the salad bar is pretty good. I will def go back
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Great new place in Carp! The place is nice and clean. Staff is friendly. Their salad bar is great and wings are to die for! 

My friends had individual pizzas which looked equally yummy. Get a pitcher of beer and you're set for the games as this establishment has plenty of TVs for you to catch the football or basketball game! 

The food is very fresh, wings are nice and spicy with plenty meat on the bone!

Love Carp and will definitely return to this place!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"We have eaten a lot of Pizza in Carpinteria. We decided to try something new. We wanted a calzone and saw that they had them. We went for dinner, the cashier who took our order was not particularly helpful or friendly. We ordered the potato wedges which were really good. A nice surprise. The calzones were delicious and perfectly cooked. It kind of has a sports bar atmosphere with T.V.'s everywhere. It can be a little loud. But the Dodgers were playing , so it was all good. We would definitely  return for the food."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"The pizza here is good. The staff is not.  They never smile, they clearly don't enjoy working there.  

They do the bare minimum.  If you ask for silverware, they point you towards the plastic silverware because no one wants to wash dishes or that is the company policy--use plastic. You have to ask for real silverware, which is what you need if you are cutting your pizza up because plastic doesn't work.

One time my son spilled his glass of water and they basically said ""here is a rag"" instead of helping. There is also a leak in the ceiling, consistently, in the back by the games.

I get that they don't like their jobs, but just fake it a little."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"This is just another over hyped under performing pizza joint.
Although service was good the pizza came up short.
Crust: had a strange texture and after taste I could not identify.
The sauce: too sweet for my liking. I understand others may like it like this.
Toppings: very generous amounts but mediocre quality.
Price: on the high side."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"It's fast food pizza.  Comparable to Rusty's or Giovanni's, but a far cry from Nutbelly.  If you're from Chicago or NY you should stay home and make your own.  If you're out having beers and need some melty cheese on dough this might just hit the spot.  If you like TV, dine in."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"This is a good classic pizza parlor spot without the classic dank. It has a nice large salad bar, beer on tap, and arcade games.  I thought the pizza was good, not stellar but pretty good. 

The place is very bright and has a whole lot of TVs. The televisions were a bit overwhelming for the family. We were there with the kids and half of the 10 large screen televisions surrounding the small room were showing news or several with some stories of abductions. The other half were sports. We did ask to switch the channels to something more kid friendly (since there were no other patrons facing the way we were) and they switched it to more news (more sports would have been preferable or maybe cartoons or something). Anyway, the food was good enough that I would go back, but for take-out next time."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Absolutely outstanding pizza, service and location. It was so nice to sit on the new back patio and enjoy their amazing pizza and the beautiful Carp weather. Everyone working was extremely nice, courteous and helpful. I would eat here JUST because of the service but lucky for me, the food is great too!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"We just came here during our Memorial Day Camping trip to escape the rain for a little bit. When I called to ask if they had room to seat 37 of us, they quickly replied, ""Sure! When?"" We headed over and had plenty of space reserved for us to sit together and everyone received their food pretty quickly! The pizza and wings were a hit with everyone I asked. I can see this becoming a traditional stop whenever we are in Carpinteria! Thank you!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Pizza Man Dan's!!!! Tiene un Exelente servicio,  muy buena comida,. Los trabajadores te atienden muy bien estan al pendiente de lo q nesesitas son muy amables, y la comida esta deliciosa,.. si vas a Carpinteria, no dejes de vicitar Pizza Man Dan's."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Quick delivery time, good temperature, tasty pizza and wings. All around a good experience. Would recommend"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Their gluten free pizza is delicious w/roasted garlic. Only downside is it's not bigger. More like a slightly larger personal pan pizza. The half sandwich deal they offer is of great size & meatball sub is definitely worth repeating. They're friendly & delivery in the area is prompt.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Great location, renovations looks spectacular especially the TVs. It's so modernized and clean friendly staff, I love the salad bar and many options that they have besides the basics. The only thing that I see that might be an issue in the future is the sliding door! highly recommend. Yes we might have plenty pizza places in carp but nothing like this one!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"We went to the avocado Festival October 7 and bought a single serve cheese pizza for $5. I was really looking forward to eating it when we got back to the car. I opened the box and to my dismay, the pizza was burnt, and hard like a rock, like you had been sitting there in the truck for 5 hours! I used to love pizza van dan's when it was in Ventura a few years back. I don't know if me and my family will ever go back there again :-( the pizza that we bought was unsellable! Worse than dominoes, and downloads is the worst of the worst"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Nothing better than a large well done pep from Pizza Man Dan's.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Want good pizza late nite? Come here!

They have a good selection and different sizes! 

I got there special which have lots of toppings.  The veggies tastes fresh.

They close at midnight and we came in at 11:15. It took awhile for our pizzas, but they were hot and fresh."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Great place to just hang out and drink some beer and eat some good pizza. My favorite is the Fiesta Pizza because it is nice and spicy! The service is great which adds to the experience.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Great way to eat, drink & be merry while enjoying the great Carpenteria weather! The choices of clean dining areas are great: from indoors to open wall to patio
 Lots of BIG HD TV's too"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Yummy, nothing like eating dinner next to Windows full of termites
   Told the manager, she didn't seem to care at all. I'm sure if the health dept would come in for an inspection, they would mind.
Took a pic, wish I could add it to the review"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Great way to eat, drink & be merry while enjoying the great Carpenteria weather! The choices of clean dining areas are great: from indoors to open wall to patio. Lots of BIG HD TV's everywhere, over 20 TV's!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Yesterday around 1 o'clock was the first time  i  ever visited here and i have to say that i had a great experience here the atmosphere is nice  and its close to the beach but over all the pizza is delicious  i ordered a pepperoni pizza with extra extra cheese and it was cooked perfectly i highly recommend this place for local pizza and tourist!!!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Good pizza. Quick service. We didn't wait long for our pizza to be done. 15 mins. So good!!!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"We were drawn to PizzaMan Dan after seeing his pepperoni pizza car listed on Yelp. Any man who dedicates his life to a love for pizza is pretty awesome. :) Our pizza was fresh, made in about 10 minutes, and the restaurant was clean. I'm not into salad, but the salad bar looked great too. I think I might've seen PizzaMan Dan himself there, but I might have been to hungry to process it. Haha. Good food, thank you!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Lately some of the more well established pizza places in Santa Barbara have lacked the quality ingredients we are accustomed to, something has been missing. I was pleasantly surprised that Pizza Man Dan had great flavor tonight. We drove a little to get to Carpinteria, but it was worth it. Carpinteria is a very cute town to drive through at night anyway, generally nice and cool (at night), even during Summer! Pizza Man Dan has a great 9.99 takeout deal right now for a large! We ended up getting pepperoni and pineapple! What I love is the OREGANO in the sauce. This is an ESSENTIAL ingredient, and I could taste it in this pizza. The ingredients were yummy, and I want Pizza Man Dan to know that pizza lovers appreciate the small but IMPORTANT details (like Oregano). I also liked our takeout salad because I could actually taste the freshness of the veggies. I also noticed you provide yummier croutons than other pizza places in town. Your pizza box is also pretty fancy inside (right now). Clearly you are a business owner that loves your business!! That's cool! Thanks for caring about your customer and the details that matter."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"This place offers ""little ceasars"" quality pizza for the price of Italian restaurants. My contact worker and I purchased a pizza and wings, and sought to the wings were better than the pizza, absolutely dissatisfied"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"While on spring vacation we discover this place. Decided to stay there since we didn't wanted to walk any more, we where so happy we did we tried pizza,calzone,garlic cheese bread.everything was excellent including service we decided we would be back before we go back home."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"The pizza was okay (nothing extraordinary), the salad bar was misleading (more about it later), but the service was pretty poor. Everyone looked annoyed, the lady working the front was not pleasant or helpful, and they ignored me several times when I needed something. The salad bar looked decent - there was a good variety of greens - but the soups weren't part of the AYCE salad bar deal! I came up to ask for a bowl to access the two soups at the salad bar, and the lady said that it would cost extra! Strangely, there's no soup option in the menu. Anyway, the place is subpar - too pricey for Pizza Hut quality and non-existent customer service."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Place is okay, reasonable food. Biggest gripe are the size of the soda cups and size of the salad dishes. Soda cups are 12 ounces, so I had to get up 4 times to get refills in 15 mts I was there. I haven't seen a restaurant sell a cup less than 16 (at worst) in ages. And the salad bowls for the lunch special are tiny. Both combined just give the place a ""cut costs at all corners feel"". If it were me, I'd have 16 ounce cups and bigger bowls, and just factor in the price."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Oh PizzaMan Dan's.  We drank some good beer across the street, and after being in the cold, wanted some hot pizza.  Thinking this was going to be a local Carp gem, we tried a pie and were disappointed.   The medium thin crust pepperoni pie we ordered fell far short in terms of crust and cheese flavor.  While some would say pizza is pizza, we definitely didn't get the quality we paid for, unfortunately.

Also, we came from Islands Brewery, and just had some avocado beer, yet when we were happy to be able to order those same beers from you guys, their carbonation was definitely off.  

On positive notes, the restaurant was clean and spacious, nice customer service, and had tons of TVs."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,We are staying at the Rincon RV resort and our wonderful neighbors told us about pizza man dans!! Receptionist was friendly and knowledgeable.  We got our delicious pizza and two bottles of wine within 20 minutes.  Delivery man was very nice!  Will definitely recommend!! You guys are awesome
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,BBQ chicken pizza is the best i have had so far! BBQ sauce has good flavor and like the cashews on the pizza. Nice thin and crispy crust too
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Passing through carpenteria I was craving pizza, found this place it was so good, clean with friendly staff.  I was going to take it to go but changed my mind once I felt the energy of this place.  The music and atmosphere was great.  Salad bar was great. Definitely coming back when I'm back up here."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Got into town late with a few hungry kids. Stopped in to grab some pizza. Even though it was almost closing time, Becky happily took our order, got the food out quickly, and didn't rush us to get out. Great pizza and wings but even better customer service! One of our favorite spots in Carp."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"We stopped by for a sandwich and some drinks to eat outside. The sandwich and drinks were good but the girl behind the counter was not. I asked what they had for beverages and she didn't seem to know what I was talking about until I said drinks. I also ordered a meatball sandwich (very good may I add) and asked for it to be cut in half. In a very short time our order was ready. I went and got it took it out to the table out front and found it hadn't been cut in half, no big deal I'll go in and ask them to cut it. I went in and asked the same girl if it could be cut in half she smiled said yes and handed me a paper plate. She smile nicely and I asked again, I then made a gesture of cutting it she smiled again and brought it to the kitchen where someone cut it in half. All I can hope is this is her first day and she was left there to fend for herself.
PS. When serving chopped up pepperoncini it might be a good idea not to serve the stems we got 4 stems in our little plastic container."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"The lunch special includes salad bar, personal pizza, and a fountain drink. There are 4 other choices besides pizza.  Same concept as Toppers in Ventura.  Only everything was a 5 instead of a 4.  I loved my lunch and will also try the Pizza Man Dan's in Ventura."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,My new favorite pizza place. Not sure about all the complaints on here. If you want a quite place to eat pizza then go to a library. This place is great. The pizza was delicious and the service was excellent. Even the lady who came by our table to clean it after we ate was nice to us. Thank god someone did something with the old building. I live down the street and will be making this my new pizza place.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Great customer service lots of options if not on the mood for pizza. Every thing I have tried has been excellent. I recommend this place.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"called in for delivery based on hotel in-room ad. should have read Yelp reviews first. my mistake. this place should not be doing delivery. The delivery person was professional in all sense, but the lady that took our phone-in order was pissed at working there, pissed at taking call-ins and just pissed at being there. Tells a lot about the place. move pass this place people. there's definitely a lot more choices - establishments who are more welcoming of outsiders

update: like all other lip service, now PizzaDan wants me to work and fill out a form!  that's the last nail in the coffin.  my friends are going to this area this weekend. guess where they are staying clear of?"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,We used to live in Carpinteria and this was our go-to spot for quick and easy dinners. Some of my favorite fast food-type pizzas.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"I always pass by this pizzeria. This week I wanted to give it a try. I ordered a single serving of gluten free pizza and one medium pepperoni and onion pizza.
It was obvious that both Pizza doughs were  premade or frozen. The crust tasted like a cardboard. The onion was chopped very small, I didn't know they were onions.
I give it one star."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"The pizza is good, but not worth the 70 minute wait. Sure, there was a big party in the other room, but give your customers a heads up. At least 5 different parties waited over 70 minutes for their food. Ridiculous."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Came here close to closing. The lady was very helpful and tolerable to my boyfriends late night shenanigans. He tends to become a bigger smart Elic as the night goes on. Good food great service. Wish the salad bar was open until close but not much is open past 9pm in Carp in weekdays so I'll take pizza.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Cold food and colder service. 
I am giving two stars because the design and seating area are very nice."

aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Best place :) the pizza is amazing fresh toppings and there are many options at the salad bar, they close late. I'm very happy that they open a pizza man in carp, we live in Ventura but my family lives  here so I was happy that have the Opportunity to impress them with this amazing place."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Great pizza. A bit on the dicey side. Calzone could be a little crispier, but overall will order again. Great customer service."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"This place was pretty great! The pizza and salad was perfect! I would definitely recommend the Meatsa Pizza because the ham, pepperoni, bacon, and sausage all tasted great! Good ingredients! My only complaint was that at the salad bar, a few toppings like the tortilla strips and mushrooms tasted a little old. overall, they were great!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"First time customer, ordered a half  tomato and mushroom pizza and the veggie calzone, both, very good.   Ordered online for delivery, easy and quick!! Loved the pizza box it came in...cute idea."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Their pizza may cost more than some places, but it is a much higher quality pizza, and their special pizzas are very delicious, if unconventional. Their pan crust is not overly thick, and is our favorite."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Great place to watch a game - they have so many TVs!!
Probably the best, if not only, sports bar place in town.  
The food is pretty good too, especially the salad/soup bar!  The pizza and wings are tasty too!  The workers are nice and helpful especially the cashier Ray, he was awesome!
We will definitely be back next time we are in Carp!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Carp has a TON of pizza places but I will say this is pretty darn tasty. The chipotle chicken with the chipotle dipping sauce is so good! Pretty stoked they're desserts aren't a commercialized baked brownie cookie number or cinnamon sticks but legit cake slices and cheese cake. We ordered online and I like that you can add tip on ahead of time and they arrived pretty fast compared to other places in town. Driver was really nice too!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Editing my review. Had a small incident where a piece of my order was missed for delivery. I was really upset. I stated my feelings on Yelp. Dan contacted me and apologized and asked us to give pizzaman dans another shot. We are eating leftover pizza from last night and it's just as amazing as fresh. Great business ethics to check in on your customers. Thank you!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"PizzaMan Dan's is really good pizza, service is average, (nothing special, nothing bad at all) so I am giving it 5 stars, but it is really just another pizza place. I recommend the anchovie pizza, because they are very generous with the amount. Overall, a good place to go."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,Pizzas are very average in quality. Must like sports TVs. There are 21 of them in the interior rooms.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"First time here. Loved it 
Ordered the pepperoni only and BBQ chicken specialty 
Thank you for the service and discount"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,The place reminds me of the atmosphere of Tony's but much cleaner the staff is very friendly no salad bar at the moment pizza was delicious the potato wedges were delicious outdoor dining was available indoor dining is available the staff was very friendly and accommodating Dan would be happy with his people down here in Carpinteria and up holding a legacy of a building in which I visited when I was young almost didn't come because I was heartbroken Tony's was gone but they are doing a great job keeping your family atmosphere
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Fantastic Pizza. Friendly service.  We will be back!  Thin crust pizza is crunchy and ingredients and fresh.  Joan and kim
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"The BEST Hawaiian BBQ pizza I've ever had, and I've lived in HI. Make sure to get ""the works"" (including jalepeño). Maria (manager) was incredibly friendly & helpful. Mahalo!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Do not order the wings. We got our pizza before our wings or even our cheese bread. In fact, We almost finished our pizza before we got the wings...not going there again...not worth it."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Got frustrated trying to order online from other local pizza places. Called PizzaMan Dan's. They picked up on the first ring. They were professional, courteous and delivered right to our motel in Carpentaria within 35 minutes of picking up the phone. Good pizza too!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Good pizza at a good price. Carryout special of large cheese for $10 was satisfying. Next time we will try others!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Sausage  pizza was bomb!!!  Great flavor and nice crispy crust.
Nice salad bar!!!
I would prefer the mix on the coke was a little sweeter.
I eat here Evey time I am in Carpinteria !!!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"We were staying at a near by Motel 6 for my daughters Lacrosse game. The night we checked in we wanted to order something for delivery. The lady at the Motel 6 gave us Pizzaman details and we decided to order. They said they charge $3.99 for delivery so we decided to pickup. Ordered the cheese ultimate with chicken topping and picked it up 30m minutes later. The pizza tasted horrible as it was extremely salty. First I thought its because its 'ultimate cheese' and thats why the salt. But then I have ordered so many cheese pizzas in my life that I lost count of it but never had to discard one being salty. Me, wife and daughter tried one slice...few bites of it and thought its not worth it and threw it away.. and yes the price is on higher side...we ordered the medium and it cost us $18.99 or so plus tax. Total waste of time and money."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,we happened upon this place while taking a mini road trip. delicious pizza!! wish it was closer to me
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Delicious pizza and they deliver to the campground! Nothing like good hot pizza when your camping at the beach!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Terrible customer service despite making our pizza wrong. Second time here, will not be back."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Vegetarian pizza is delicious. Loaded with fresh veggies. Some more cooked than others. Tasty. Crust was crisp. Veggies are too heavy for the thin crust. Don't really need a salad with this selection. Yummy. Filling. Tasty!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"PizzaMan Dan's in Carpinteria is an amazing location! I always go there for their sub sandwiches, but this time I decided I would go for a classic pepperoni pizza for Pi Day (March 14th). I know there are a lot of pizza places in Carpinteria but PizzaMan Dan's is definitely my favorite place to sit down and eat some good pizza/sandwiches for a good price. Also they always have coupons on their website which are useful!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"I will be totally blunt, this place is terrible. It's interior looks like it was designed by someone who used to build clean rooms for NASA. The noise level is terrible. The intercom just adds to the noise by being distorted. The pizza was okay. But hey, I can get Rusty's in the comfort of my own home.We had a table of four, all of whom like wine. The wine at this place absolutely sucks. As Isaac Haye's says: ""Walk on by."""
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"This place deserves 5 stars for sure! Wonderful, friendly service, a pretty decent salad bar, those awesome fountain drink machines, top notch pizza and open late!

We were a party of two staying in Carpinteria for this Labor Day Weekend. Pizzaman Dan's was only a 3 min drive from our hotel. They have a large back patio for outdoor dining and with the cool Carp weather, it was the perfect place for dinner. 

The pizza was really hot. I felt the toppings were very generous. My 19 yr old son got the Meatsa pizza and I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ one. Oh man, never could I have imagined chorizo and BBQ chicken could pair so nicely with Ham and pineapple. It was amazing. Much more flavorful than the meatsa one (I had a slice of my son's) and honestly I just wanted more of the Hawaiian BBQ. My son thinks pineapple on pizza is a horrible concept but he tried it and he said it was good too!

Highly recommend getting Pan style crust over the thin. We didn't get any thin but saw another table with thin and it just didn't look as good as ours did. 

This place reminds me of Pizza Factory only I think it's better. 

Seemed to be a local favorite and popular for families of all ages."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"The thin crust is good! Our PAN crust pepperoni pizza was made very well last night at this location! The crust actually tasted buttery, in a good way. We were very happy with our order! Great 9.99 for a 1 topping Large Deal (during Covid crisis). Please support this yummy business if you're craving good pizza!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"This place has a lot of great qualities, but one major thing was lacking CUSTOMER SERVICE. We live very close and often walk here THREE TIMES A WEEK to have lunch or dinner. We check in on the machine by the register every time. Today we earned 12 ""delicious hot wings"". The cashier ignored us as the machine began to count down the seconds we had left until the offer wasn't visible ? When she finally returned her attention to us, she said ""well, to fix it I'd have to go and get a code"". I stared at her expectantly as she did absolutely nothing. I politely asked if she could go and ask someone for the code so we could get our hot. She actually let out a huff and a sneer and went to find someone to help her. The lady that came to help us told us it was OUR FAULT for working the machine incorrectly. We followed all the prompts, and are very tech savvy people. We politely asked how we could avoid this situation in the future, and the lady accused us of using the same offer earlier in the week. We did not. However, we were still blamed and although she gave us our free wings (we also purchased other items), she wasn't able to properly explain what exactly we did to make the machine malfunction. Because.... It was still our fault. If the cashier would have paid attention to us as we were ordering our dinner, this would have never happened. But it was still our fault. As they were bitching about us trying to scam free wings, the woman pouring the beer proceeded to waste copious amounts of beer by pouring it improperly (I was a bartender for 10 years). At any rate, we are regulars who happily pay for our meals here multiple times a week. This was a truly bad experience and the staff need to be educated on how CUSTOMER SERVICE works. I'm not saying the customer is always right, but there are better ways to solve an issue without blaming paying customers for a cashiers 5 second attention span."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Stopped by with my siblings for a quick bite. We tried the Large deep dish White Chipotle specialty pizza. When we first arrived we didn't really know what to expect in regards to being able to eat outside and the quality of the food. Let me just say it went beyond my expectations, a back dining area was set up with overhead heaters which kept the chairs nice and warm. The outdoor dining was nice and spacious, well kept and GREAT MUSIC! As for the food we waited about 20mins since they had a couple deliveries ahead of our order but the wait was worth it as long as we got quality food. The pizza was nice and soft and the crust was the perfect amount of crunchiness. When we took our first bites you could feel the chipotle taste and the cheesiness, everything was cooked just right and complimented the whole pizza. When I think chipotle, I think spicy but it was not spicy at all just right. If you are looking for something quick with great quality pizza, this is the place to stop at. For sure will be a place I will be returning to."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"I am here for school once a month. I stay at the Best Western Plus. Food came fast. It was hot. WAY better than expected. I believe I ordered potato wedges, too and am sorry to see that they are no longer on the menu. That aside--I was VERY pleased. Pizza a wedges were delicious as was the chocolate cake. Two thumbs up."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,It's seriously the best pizza I've ever had! They are very generous with the toppings and the crust is delicious! I highly recommend it!!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,Ordered a Pesto pollo pizza when delivered it was wrong order got charged for a 4 cheese which was not what I ordered as was ordering had to give card number 3 times when called to tell what happened was gonna get charged the difference and tax BULLSHIT on that kept even though did not want as I told person on phone we'll keep and won't order from pizza man dans again wife had same problem with rustys get your acts together pizza man dans no more
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,Ordered delivery while in Carpintería. Fast delivery and the food was still very hot! Family loved it. You won't be disappointed!
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"As a 35 year carp/Santa Barbara local... there used to be only ONE place worth ordering GOOD pizza From. 564-1111, you've now been replaced on my speed dial with easy internet access ordering, and PayPal accepting Pizza Man Dan's. Plus ... (CONTROVERSY) ... pizza man Dan's has better ranch dressing. I never thought I'd say that about any place... also, their pizza tastes like pizza. If I wanted a frozen pizza... I'd just buy one and make it myself. Pizza Man Dan's is worth the delivery fee. Their toppings are fresh and their cheese seems to be actual cheese that follows the laws of physics/chemistry when warm. It melts. Pizza Man Dans has replaced the old, trust 564-111."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Yes, this place offers GF options

This place is great! We were ""roughing it"" at the campgrounds at Carpinteria SB, and the first time we went, we noticed that there were pizzas being delivered everyday that we were there. So we promised ourselves the next time we would camp, we would order pizza, so that's what we did!

When it was dinner time, we called the 800 number and a gentleman picked up and grabbed our order. We were having issues with the communication since even though cell service with AT&T is at 3 bars, I guess I was still breaking up at some points. But anyway, told them I was at the State Beach and told them our campground space. 

Sure enough, in about 20 minutes, the pizza man was here. Pizza and wings were piping hot (Pizzaman Dan's is  literally 5m away from the SB). Great pizza. We got the pan pizza. Topping were a bit sparse (nothing out of the ordinary compared to Pizza Hut or Domino's), but the cheese was very cheesy. Good food, and they also provided plates, napkins, small packets of parmesan cheese, and chili.

The GF pizza was thin and crispy. My wife loved it. We highly recommend this place!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"This place is great. Their gluten free crust is delicious and comes in 2 sizes! The people who work there are always nice and are very helpful. The NFL ticket is just amazing. I've already been there more times Han I'd like to admit! Their wings are the best I've had in town. The place seems to be running very smoothly since the opening day, and being in the F&B industry for ten plus years, I know that isn't easy. Great job guys!!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"My son and I lovePizza Man Dan's we used to live by the one by Seabridge off Victoria.  Never had a bad experience.  So this is new for me.  Today I ordered for pick from the Carpinteria location. I ordered a Sub, potatoe wedges, and individual pizza.  Girl said 15 minutes.  My son and I left at the 15 minute mark and there was only 1 person in front of me picking up his order.  The young man greeted me with a smile he's always nice and helpful. Thanks Rayshaun.  After I paid he went to go grab my order and told the girls in the kitchen there's no sub.... No one made it!!!!! He came back and apologized and said it will just be a few minutes they forgot to make it.  So I went and sat in my truck.... it was very kind of Rayshaun to deliver my food to me and again apologized.   The kindness he showed made up for the girls mess up."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,The cheese bread was delicious. We had great service & will be returning! The patio was open and we had plenty of room to enjoy your meal.
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Tasty pizza. Jalapeno poppers also really good. Got all three crusts styles (gluten free, thin crust, pan crust) and all were really good. Delivery was prompt and super friendly. Excellent phone ordering experience as well.
Will order again!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"This pizza is AMAZING! It looks appetizing and its cooked perfectly. Sometimes you get pizza and the sauce is sweet or overwhelming. Not this pizza! The sauce is savory and the perfect amount so that it's not overpowering. The crust... OMG!!! They could sell it by itself its soooo good. Next time I'm in the area, this will be dinner, no question about it. 
The box is PERFECT! LOL!!! Fun and functional!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"This place was surprisingly pretty empty on a Sunday afternoon, and had outdoor seating available for all 11 of us who were starving after our drive from camping all weekend. 
How can you go wrong with pizza? 
Well... I'll tell you- the thin veggie crust was slightly burnt and unless you like that extra crispy crust, then go for the regular crust. Our friends ordered a pan crust pepperoni and it looked delicious but I didn't try it. The cheese bread looked great and the wings were standard but definitely not spicy as we requested. The picture of the Philly cheesesteak on the menu is totally deceiving. The sandwich didn't look like the picture and it was lacking in flavor and filling. I'd stick with the pan pizza if I ever return.
The male cashier was clueless when I asked him for ranch and bbq on the side. While he looked around confused, he said ""um I don't know, well yeah, but it costs extra"".

aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"I initially came here for lunch for their special because my coworker told me they have a good deal for lunch. I've opted to get the sub sandwich combo which came with a drink and salad. The salad bar had some flies flying around, wish they had some sort of net or coverings but oh well. They had a good amount of varietal in the salad bar from artichoke hearts, cucumbers, mushrooms, Etc the sub was okay, I really like how soft and pillowy the dough was, but there is not enough meat to fill me up. I did decide to order again from them for dinner and we ordered two different types of pizza, one regular crust and the other thin crust. Their thin crust is really good, it's almost as if there is no crust at all! The topings go to the edge for the thin crust. The regular pizza crust was thicker but I would say the thin crust is better. The wings were tiny and the suicide sauce is not super spicy (if you can handle jalapeños you can handle the heat). The wings came with one ranch sauce oh, and the ranch sauce is pretty good. Them and the Mesa Pizza have one of the better ranches. I recommend this place for their lunch special and the thin crust pizza!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"I am a food snob...But I LOVE their pizza!  My fave is the vegetarian - thin crust, fresh veggies, not too greasy.... Highly recommend.  Best in town!!!"
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,positive,"Pizza is good and the deal they are currently having during COVID is amazing! 
Walking distance from the beach."
aY_n9RSaD2Yw09jSFFePew,PizzaMan Dan's,Italian,negative,"Ordered a medium 2 topping pizza for delivery with a coupon. Was quoted a price.   Delivery guy shows up and asks with a receipt for a higher price.  He called his manager and says our coupon will not work because discounted price (just on pizza, not including tax and delivery fee) is $.01 under the limit.  Yes.  1 penny.   And by the way the coupon does not mention that the fees are excluded.  Only says $15 minimum on orders.  My order was $21 and change.  Also if there was an issue they have my number and should have called me to explain and ask if I still wanted the order.  You don't quote one price and then show up and demand a higher price.  Thanks Pizza Man Dan. You made an already bad day even worse.
P.S. Rustys has a $12 minimum"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Wow. Wow. We've been trying to go here for a while and for some reason or another it hasn't happened. We used our access card and walked there last night and I must say this is one of the best meals I've had in awhile. For Italian food..... the best I've had forever which is a long time. We will be coming back. Deep fried ravioli appetizer. We had chicken alfredo and eggplant Parmesan for entrees. She ordered a glass of wine that was $10 that we did realize we could buy the bottle for $11 later. Which is fine I understand. When we come back we will be served by Mario because he is the best.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"There are not enough superlatives! Awesome food, drink and personnel!! I can't wait to get back to Santa Barbara and Chase!! Terry"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Horrible service. Our waiter never checked us. I had to flag him down to tell him my ravioli's were terrible. I had a clump of dough on my plate and all the cheese had spilled out of the few raviolis that I had on my plate. I told the waiter, he said, huh and walked away and came back with our check. I asked him about the clump of dough and he said that's how they make them. I had to explain to him that ravioli's had filling. My husbands porkchop was very dry and bland. The waiter was very arrogant. He never said he was sorry he never came back to our table after he took our order and it took forever to get him to take our order  I had to eat 4 pieces of bread to fill up. I walked out hungry. They did take it off the bill, after a awkward conversation with the waiter. I will never go back. It was pricy for the quality of food we were given. I was so disappointing."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,We stopped in for a quick bite for lunch time.  The decor is ok...it is small....so if you have more than one kid you might be waiting. The food frankly wasn't that bad.  I had the chicken parm sandwich and my wife had some sort of pasta which wasn't bad.  The service was ok...nothing experienced that these other reviewers had.  We only had one kid so it was find being tucked away in the corner.  Big strollers or mulitple kids....I think I would go somewhere else.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Enjoyed a great dinner at the bar on a cold February night. Fantastic atmosphere, great wine counsel by the bartender. The dinner was great and met a few locals who seem to be regulars - always a good sign! The decor is a spirited blend of over the top Madonna Inn, English pub, and holiday event.  Will definitely go back!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I've eaten here twice. Once in 2007 and the second time was last week. I only ordered the sliders the second time and they made me sick. The beef had gone bad and I got a stomach ache! Thank god I only ate one. In case you're wondering, the first time I had the chicken picatta and it tasted great. But that was in 2007. So I don't know what happened to this place."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We found ourselves in Santa Barbara UCSB graduation weekend, yikes! Anyway we were looking for a place to eat and found Chase on Yelp. So we headed out. A bit of an odd experience. We go there and parked in back which was easy and great. Came in, the host asked us if we wanted a table, we said yes for two, he said just a minute and then never came back. He walked by us several times and we looked at him like have our table. Before he sorted it out, we sat at the bar. The bartender was nice and made a great lemon drop. The menu was tough for me as a vegetarian so I sufficed with salad and a bread. My b/f had chicken piccata which is their specialty and he thought it was just average. It is a cute little place. Maybe the menu will suit you better."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I always like going to Chase. The food is pretty good (not great, but consistently pretty good), but my wife really likes the atmosphere here so we end up going here quite frequently. If you're wondering about the atomosphere, it's got the whole red booth thing going and 1000s of twinkle lights hanging from all areas of the restaurant. It's a romantic spot for the over 35 crowd. Full bar. Service is hit and miss. Sometimes when we go it's great, other times, it's terrible, but it's a unique looking local restaruant that's pretty good. We've been many times and will continue to go on a regular basis."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"What can I say but, ""Outstanding"".  We happened upon Chase while driving down State Street in Santa Barbara.  My husband liked the ""look"" of the restaurant (not our typical criteria for restaurant selection).  It reminded me of those mahogany and leather high-end restaurants of old... which somehow managed to be very comfortable and inviting.  The decor: large leather banquettes and contemporary chairs, giant mirrors, grape vines sporting tiny, Italian, white lights hanging from the ceiling and an odd collection of ""sculptures"" with fresh roses on each table.  The restaurant was impeccably clean.

But let's talk about the FOOD!  Fresh bread was served with butter and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  While we waited for our entrees', the waiter brought us a tasting of their white beans (fabulous) and cabbage cooked in a spicy tomato sauce (yum).  

My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Very tasty, very Italian, very plentiful.  The homemade Italian dressing on the salad was to die for.

I ordered their homemade ravioli appetizer (giant ravioli stuffed with cheese and fried to the perfect crispness) and Insalata Caprese (Buffalo Mozzarella with tomato slices and fresh basil drizzled with a wonderful Balsamic Vinegar).  Caprese is my favorite salad, and this one did not disappoint.  

By the way, service was incredibly attentive (even bringing us fresh bread plates when our entrees' arrived).  I wish we were staying longer in Santa Barbara... I'd like to work my way down their menu!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Beautiful, classy and very old school Italiano decor.

Service is prompt, music is great (i.e. Sinatra, Dean Martin) and food was delicious!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Chase is marvelous. The romantic ambiance is great for an intimate dinner date, and the food is pretty good too. The lighting is a bit dark, making it hard to read the manus

But the food was lovely. I had a great chicken parm. and their bread is great.

My only complaint is that the wait staff was a bit slow. We had to wait for a long time before our food came and it was a while before we were brought the check and refills on drinks."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Best Italian in SB.  Warm atmosphere and great staff!  One of the only restaurants in the area with outside seating on State St.  A must try.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This place has a great happy hour! Probably one of the best happy hours in town actually. They have a $5 appetizer menu as well as great deals on wine and cocktails. We had to drive back to LA that night so could not enjoy too much, but I look forward to coming back when we don't have a big drive ahead of us and indulging in drinks and appetizers for a great price!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"My review is strictly for the desserts. I had the Creme brûlée and the Chocolate cake. Both were pretty solid. The bartender was attentive. However, he did ask if wanted ice cream with our cake which we said yes to but we didn't get. The decor was nice inside with the lights, too."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,We went here simply because my son's name is Chase. Reviews were low but the place was great! Had a Moscow mule poured by an entertaining bartender who's worked there 30 years so was good for recommendations. I went with his and got the chicken piccata and was not disappointed. Little pricey though
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I will never (never say never) eat here again. Our table of four was expecting a fabulous experience in a classic Italian setting. What happened was quite the contrary. The service was untrained and uneven. The main course came before the appetizers (the amount of mussels for cost was pathetic). All of the orders had food delivered incorrectly and had to be taken back for adjustments. The ""steamed"" vegetables were raw, the Mahi Mahi was so dry it couldn't be swallowed. I sent my dinner back refusing any more indignation and was still charged. With much discussion with management and server to adjust an inflated, incorrect bill, and very little apologies, we left shaken and unhappy."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The food is good, the service is mediocre at best. We came at a slow time on a Sunday, and our server neglected to give us plates, silverware, and napkins. He was inattentive, neglected to refill drinks, and did not once check on how we were doing or if we needed anything. I won't be rushing back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My husband and I had dinner at Chase recently and while the atmosphere was interesting the rest of it was a let down.  The service was not very good, though I must admit the server seemed to be aware of the fact that everything was slow and seemed to feel badly about it.  The food was only mediocre and my husband got very sick from eating it."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,We stopped by Thanksgiving night and they were open! The food is outstanding as is the service. They were all decked out for the holidays. We will be coming back soon.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Comfortable ambiance, Chix piccata to die for, and the white bean dip and provaka was AMAZING!  We went for a drink in the afternoon and then back for dinner the same night. The bartender has been there for 29 years and is a great guy :)"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"The corn and vegetable soup is nice and creamy, very good. The place is classy with a vinyard decor and music to match. Staff is really nice too.  Overall it's a nice place I would come here again."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"You gotta go to this place!! 
Great food and service - especially at the bar! Tom the bartender is so personable and friendly. I've never experienced a bartender who knows fine dining as this gentleman."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We love Chase!  The food was wonderful and the service even more so. The atmosphere is warm, fun, inviting, cool! We came while in SB holiday shopping and were wowed by the amazing decorations; everywhere, hanging from the ceiling, atop the bar, and every other place one could be squeezed in. A complete delight. I had the grilled salmon which was excellent, and my husband loved his chicken piccata.  Terrific experience!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Chase used to be amazing. I am not sure if it is the new ownership but it was terrible now. The restaurant is filthy with dust hanging from the ceiling. We sat at the bar and I am not sure if the bartender has even made a drink before. We weren't welcomed when we sat down or offered drinks. Eventually we asked for a beer and multiple times for waters. I ordered the red snapper, and they served me chicken. I sent back the dish but when it took over 20 minutes I asked them to cancel the order entirely. Five minutes later they brought me the meal and I told them I had already canceled it. Then the manager came out and tried to serve it to me again. We sat with empty drinks for the entire ""meal"". The bartender also struggled to make margaritas for the couple sitting next to us and took about 10 minutes to make two drinks which she managed to spill everywhere in the process. Overall dirty, terrible service and servers who don't even know the menu. Too bad another Santa Barbara staple has gone down the drain."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Food:  Everything was too salty and the sauces tasted like they had been on the stove too long.  They do NOT serve mojitos, why?

Service:  Our waiter sounded like da guy from da food school who learned all the names of the stuff but had no grammar training and lacked in so many ways except in the amount of cologne he was wearing.  The manager was very nice and so was the little old guy, forgot his name...the bartender was fine except when our waiter gave him the wrong drink order.

Decor: Hmmm really bad portraits of Sinatra and others...

Drink here, eat a little something if no one else is open...that's it."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I live in the San Gabriel Valley and visit SB frequently and I always make it a point to go to Chase for lunch or dinner or just cocktails. I've been going to Chase B&G for at least 20 years. Have always had superb service and tried different entrees and have never been disappointed.  I have gone there for Thanksgiving dinner as well and the menu is excellent.  When the devastating fires and mudslides occurred this past year, Chase emailed their customers a comforting invitation about providing service to their loyal customers and new customers. I will be visiting SB in August and September and plan to have dinner at Chase while I'm there.  I definitely give Chase 5 stars!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Have been here numerous times and visited again last night on an extremely unpleasant hot night in Santa Barbara.  Turn up the A/C please..  I usually love the warm & inviting atmosphere of this restaurant, so I won't hold the hot weather against them.  Our service was very attentive but did seem like a lack of communication between the number of staff servicing us.  Had to repeat ourselves several times and a mix up on drinks, but all handled without issue.  Quality of food was good and predictably comfortable (comfortably predictable).  I know when I go here I'm going to order a big plate of comfort food.  Spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna and tonight it was chicken parmigiana.  My other half had a healthier choice with the salmon and vegetables.  We both felt like our food hit the spot and will return again."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The two stars is for the soups included in the Milanese's and Provincial's pasta. The soups are the only decent dish the whole night.  Otherwise, the fettucine taste old and over-cooked, the pork bland, the tonight's special appetizer is twice the price it should be, and the pre-meal bread is plain and forgettable.  The total meal for the night also cost twice what it should be for the quality.
My friend chose this place only because the decor at this night, just past X'mas, looked cozy and well-lit.  That and the soup are the only saving grace for the night."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My mom and I stopped here for dinner back in December 2010.  We never made it in.  There was a line at the door, and everyone in line was murmuring whether or not there was a host/hostess, sign-in sheet, or if it was a ""seat yourself"" situation, until the hostess finally presented herself after 10 minutes of waiting.  The hostess was an older woman - nothing special about her; she was wearing a plain long-sleeved white shirt and pants that looked like the equivalent of grey yoga/workout pants.  The reason I mention this is because it was like she was judging those waiting in line by their appearance, and helping only those whom she thought deserving of help, while she wasn't exactly your ideal looking hostess.  She seated a party of 3 at the bar, then 2 very obviously drunk girls who got in front of us at an outside table that still had dishes on it from previous customers, took one look at me and my mom, then not-at-all-discreetly asked the couple behind us if she could get them something to drink while they waited.

My mom and I looked at each other, didn't think we were underdressed, and we both thought it was absurd how we just got passed over.  We left immediately and went to Palazzio's, where we were greeted right away, had excellent customer service and fantastic food."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"i took my girlfriend for her birthday but unfortunately ""the great old Chase"" that i remember is long gone. the staff was was slow, inattentive and incompetent but the real prize here is the food.
starting with the bread (they bought at safeway), the bland caesar's salad was only surpassed by the  3 meat lasagna which was inedible. my girlfriends steak was nothing to write home about either (all 32 bucks worth).
we're not going back...ever.
used to love the place;  but the new management  is way off track."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Having grown up in Santa Barbara and enjoyed many evenings at this restaurant, we took my parents here for dinner the day after Thanksgiving and were very disappointed in the lack of warmth or welcome in the service which was capable but very mechanical. Then, after dinner and paying the check, we were talking when Jason came up and informed us that we needed to vacate the table because someone else had it reserved.  We had been there a little over an hour and a half and paid $250 for drinks and dinner. I asked to speak to the manager and the owner (who apparently is new and doesn't care about repeat business) met me at the door (in sloppy jeans and a tee shirt) and informed me that there was fine print at the bottom of the menu that says they have a 90 minute policy for tables!  I pointed out that there were other open tables and he said that other people wanted our specific booth. He was belligerent and unapologetic and offered nothing to compensate us for a bad evening at his restaurant.  Having dined at restaurants literally all over the world I can say that this is a first and we will not go back which is sad for all the employees in the kitchen who still make a great chicken piccata."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Best chicken piccata on the planet. Love the local atmosphere. Bar is great. Could use a dusting but they are so busy they would have to shut down for a couple days to do it. Just turn the lights down a little more and have another drink!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Overall I would give it a 3.5 star. The food is good but the service is bad. The bar tender has zero personality and was kinda rude when he sat us in the restaurant. After sitting down, it took about 10 min to get anything to drink. The food was pretty good but they forgot to bring part of the order so that kinda sucked. I don't think I would go there again unless I absolutely had to."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"this restaurant is an icon to santa barbara, i remember when Angie use to greet us and treat all the customers like family, she was awesome the life of Chase.....the food is still excellent the servers are helpful and efficient, but the new owner has no business etiquette or class, he yells at his servers in front of customers and doesnt mingle or make his customers feel like its a family restaurant. Where did this guy come from? Has he ever worked in a restaurant or run one? i dont think so!!! So sad this iconic restaurant is in the hands of such a terrible owner he is running it to the ground, it saddens me and othes who dine there regularly."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"The restaurant was open late on Thanksgiving and did not force a Thanksgiving special menu on us and for this only it deserves 4 stars. 
The food was good, the pasta was al dente and the cocktails loaded. You want to walk home, not drive. The service was adequate. A little pricey for what it is overall."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Raviolis are the BOMB. Fettuccini was off the chain ! Server was beautiful AND smart and sweet love love love
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,looked like a good place but no one greeted me or offered assistance. Bad service ill go down the street and see what else is available.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We stopped here for lunch and ate outside. The food was wonderful; I had the lobster picatta which was a special and delicious. Our service was fine and not pushy. The interior has that type of dark, naugahyde booth decor, which I love, so I would definitely come here again to sip martini's and have dinner."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My husband and I walked in here to since the restaurant we originally had reservations at had a live band and was very loud. We were on a winery vacation and wanted something quiet.

We walked in and asked for a seat outside. The hostess laughed at us when we asked and explained that it was really cold and thought that we were crazy for wanting to do so (it was in the low 70s). 

We sat outside and ordered a bottle from the wine list. I did not get a chance to look at it since my husband picked out the wine. The menu looked really good and I had a tough time deciding what to eat, which is usually a good sign. 

They brought us some freshly baked bread with butter and shredded Parmesan cheese that tasted wonderful. Both of our meals came with salads that really complimented the bread well.

My husband, who typically orders something non-traditional, ordered the lasagna that was made with beef, veal and pork. I ordered the linguine with spicy tomato sauce with mussels and clams. Both were excellent and filling. 

For dessert we ordered a cannoli to share, and this is where the docked 2 stars come from. The hostess sat a couple next to us and asked us if we wanted to order dessert. I ordered the cannoli and thirty minutes later (when the couple seated next to us had gone through two margaritas each and were eating their meals) our waiter asked us if we needed anything else and was about to hand us our checks. I told him that we had ordered dessert about thirty minutes before and he ran inside. Ten minutes later, our cannoli arrived. It was really really good, but slightly ruined due to the long wait and lack of apology.

When our bill arrived I noticed that they had charged for the cannoli. At every restaurant I had ever been to they always made it a courtesy to not charge for the dessert, but not only did they charge us, they did not even apologize for making us wait over half an hour for a damn cannoli. 

Anyway, the food was wonderful but the service was terrible. We were laughed at when I walked in and never apologized to when we left. We probably just had a bad experience."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Delicious food and a FANTASTIC bartender named Todd!! He was so fun to talk to and his drinks were absolutely delicious--I particularly love his lemon drop! Can't praise him enough, he was so helpful with the menu and clearly knew what he was doing behind the bar. Will be going back and definitely will be sitting at the bar again! He recommended their cheesy bread mixed with some mussels are and I must say it's an absolute MUST! 

Not to mention, fabulous atmosphere and great lighting at night with the Christmas lights up all year long!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Great little local restaurant. We sat on the front patio to catch the full moon rise last night. Unfortunately, it rose off the back of the restaurant. Christina, the hostess came to find us and let us know the moon was rising out the back. Friendly, helpful staff, & great food. This is the kind of place that's indicative of the friendly Santa Barbara locals. Also a good place to visit at Christmas. They always do beautiful decorations."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"It wasn't bad, but not as good as I had hoped.  Things started with being greeted by the hostess with a fairly curt ""Can I help you?"" as if two people entering a restaurant through the front door wasn't self-explanatory. 

My cocktail was great, the service was reasonably elegant, but I have to agree with another reviewer that both our dishes were pretty salty. The salad was of the pale, crispy variety, and the veal in my ravioli was pretty hard to find; it was really pretty much ricotta inside with some ground bits that could have been anything. And the dish probably could have done without the mass-market olives that were very generously spread atop."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"My boyfriend and I just happened to stumble upon this restaurant as most of the other restaurants on the street were no longer serving dinner. The bartender at Chase greeted us and told us he had to check with the kitchen to see if they were still serving. Thankfully, they were but I was concerned we would get lousy service and a bad attitude for walking in so late. This was not the case. I could go on and on about how wonderful the service was. Our waiter had an excellent sense of humor, was prompt, knowledgeable, and he did not make us feel rushed. I could also go on and on about the food!! It was authentic and delicious. I ordered the chicken alfredo and added broccoli. My boyfriend ordered the carbonara. The portions were perfect and the prices were even better. My boyfriend and I have travelled all around the world (including Italy!) and this restaurant is in my top ten."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,My friend and I went to Santa Barbara for our birthdays and we stumbled upon Chase bar and Grill on State Street I had heard it was really good and we had the lunch specials that were 9.95 and they were fabulous she had an arugula salmon salad and I had the mahi-mahi with sautéed vegetables and garlic delicious and Victor was our waiter and Victor was a rockstar you should come in and ask for him such a nice experience for our birthday celebration!!!!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Met client here for lunch. Has a great location, nice atmosphere, excellent and friendly service.

The food was good, not excellent.  The chicken breast looked like something that came out of a package.  It had that flat, pre-cut look.  Not too appetizing.   The bed of vegetables on which it rested was good, not great.  I must admit, however, the garlic sauce it was prepared in was excellent.

Overall I'd say Chase is a good place and I'd go back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,The food is excellent and probably the best Italian in Santa Barbara.  The place itself is charming and cozy.  The staff is very friendly.  One night I walked in with 3 other people and didn't know it was right near closing time.  They were more than happh to serve us.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Went to Chase Bar & Grill for our 2 year anniversary. It is a very romantic spot with cozy booths and twinkly lights above. The service from the staff was absolutely amazing especially our server, Edgar. He was friendly and attentive and made great recommendations when we were torn on what to order. The food was incredible! We enjoyed every course, especially the Cannoli which are our of this world! Would definitely recommend Chase and will be returning soon."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Sat at the bar and it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged by bartender. He took 10 minutes to pour my wine. Asked for a glass of water and he gave it to the lady next to me! There's so many choices in SB, I'll take my business somewhere else! I have gone to Chase at least once a month, but the service was horrible! He wasn't even busy!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"It was ok...good service, good food. Had the halibut and beans..yummy!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"A little getaway in Paris? New York? It sure looks like it...so when I saw the Chase at Christmas last year, I knew it would be the perfect place for my women's group luncheon. And it was. Twenty-one WOMEN, and everyone agreed: delicious food, extremely attentive wait staff, and perfect location. Thank you, we'll be back!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Underwhelming.  My pork chop came out medium rare.  No!  And for having been herbed I couldn't taste any evidence of it.  Husband was equally underwhelmed by their provencal.  Also they forget to tell you if their sauces have dairy which my body can't figure out how to digest.  considering the price it just wasn't worth it.  A bit too bland.  Might give the salmon a chance.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I really like the decor inside, and the ambiance is inviting.

The food is good; however, it takes awhile for it to come to the table so don't eat here if you're on a time crunch."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Went for lunch...Edgar was our waiter. We sat outside which was really nice. Food was great and Edgar was super helpful, attentive, and charming. If I lived here I'd be back!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,This place is amazing! Between the location and the variety of food selection you can't go wrong.The pesto bread and Pasta Penne Carbonara are the best in town!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Just got home from dinner at Chase - couldn't be more pleased with our experience! I had the fresh salmon, my husband had the steak and lobster! Both delicious and exactly as described by our waiter. Definitely team work with numerous people checking on us for drinks, water, bread, etc. The waiter brought us a Brussels  sprout appetizer cooked in balsamic vinegar and ginger - just because, no charge! It was the BEST!!  Dessert was also fantastic! Thank you Chase!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The food is better than average and they do offer good pricing for lunch specials.  Problem is with the service.  The daytime waitress seemed disinterested in being there and was slow with refills, condiments, etc.  It wasn't like the place was busy, she just had zero personally.  Won't be back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,This restaurant has been a favorite of mine for many years. Homestyle italian food with friendly service and a patio seating right on State Street.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went there just because we had not been there before, and wanted to try it. Decor looked like fun when we went inside. We were only a party of two and were tightly seated against the wall with other couples. This would have been OK if we were looking to make new friends, but that wasn't what we were after. Tables were 6"" apart one one side and 12"" on the other side, so you could barely squeeze thru. Tables were also wobbly. My wife is a vegan and ordered anything that the chef chose to prepare that was vegan. This usually sparks a little creativity. When the food was brought out, she was served a spinach dish covered with cheese. We explained to the waiter that ""vegan"" meant nothing from an animal, so he then suggested cheese ravioli...duh!!  Obviously neither he nor the chef knew what a ""vegan"" was. Quite surprising for a full service restaurant. She settled for a side dish of spaghetti marinara for $13.99. Waiter and other staff were friendly, but had difficulty with the English language."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Overall ambience was great... Cook is terrible! Ordered a steak medium well and it came back rare... Send it back and it came back rare in a little bit warmer... Still purple and bloody. Server didn't seem to care.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Where do I start! I love the food and ambiance here!  Immediately when you walk in, you are greeted by a whole bunch of lights hung all over the restaurant it is absolutely beautiful! I've been here a few times and have had Daniel as my waiter who is very friendly and attentive. I either go with the chicken picatta or the amazing ahi tartare (which was on the new specials appetizer list), which both are my two favorite meals. The first time I came was around Christmas time and the decorations were so great! The Chase has great employees and a great feel as soon as you walk in with lights everywhere. The pastas are also very, very good. I love it here and will continue to come back :)"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Had a large party there. Great food. Great atmosphere. Went there on a Groupon discount and will definitely be back. Only downfall is the harbor is usually full and hard to get to
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"My husband and just happen bye and  it looked interesting so we stopped by for appetizers and drinks. The staff and decor were so welcoming the food and drinks were so good we made sure to stop for lunch the next day. 
I am still thinking about the lunch it was soo delicious I had the calamari steak so tender it melted in my mouth. My husband had his favorite chicken piccata and it surpassed my home made. It was a good stop!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Had a lovely dinner celebrating our anniversary. Food was delicious and the staff were friendly and attentive. Will definitely be going back when we're in Santa Barbara again.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This place looks like a 4 star plus cozy Italian kitchen with great good. There is something about if that doesn't work though. We went there the day after Christmas for lunch; as expected place was busy and slower than usual service so no complaint (we could see they were short of at least two servers). After lunch we ordered Penne and a side of mushroom to go for our kid who'd fallen sleep while waiting for our table. Couple hours later we opened the to go box and no mushroom. And to top it off, both my wife and kid who had the penne got diarrhea."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Such a charming place. While the food is not the best (overcooked and limited flavor) the ambience is incredible. Special thanks to the owner for taking care of us tonight. For some reason our reservation was not on the books but the owner Jack did his best to make us comfortable with a full house. A wonderful place to go for holiday cheer.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I hadn't eaten here in several years. Used to be a favorite lunch spot with my sister on special occasions. Last night I went for dinner with my mom and two daughters, ages 10 and 14. The service was excellent, portions were generous, and the food was as delicious as I remembered it. The ambience was very nice too. The prices are a little steep though, and I was wishing they had a kid's menu for smaller portions/lower prices."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went here in between engagements, so figured it was perfect as the guy who seated us (owner?) mentioned he had reservations so we would have to be out of there within an hour. Staff was very nice, but prices were outrageous for very average food. What really irritated me was that we were clearly in a hurry, and yet a couple that was seated 10 minutes after us and ordered 15 minutes after us received their food before us (albeit, only 1 minute before us, but come on, clearly our food was sitting under a lamp waiting to be served, so the least the staff could have done was serve us first)!  

Also, space is VERY crammed!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"the food here is very decent.  you get a nice meal and no matter what others say about the ambiance, we had a nice experience.  the help was friendly and it was not a hassle in any way. i will go back!  nice bar with a tv.  a cozy place!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We order from here a lot, and use Restaurant Connection, since it's hard to find a babysitter for 3 kids at times. 
My go to meal is always chicken piccata and it never disappoints!
Last night we went to dinner and my husband wanted to switch it up and ordered the best steak on the menu, ""Tomahawk"" steak. All I can say is WOW! It was so juicy, tasty and melted in my mouth! 
We used the Axxess deal and our grand total was $89 for 2 dinners, 2 salads, bottomless bread, and 2 large beers, glass of wine and a martini! I am very happy with Chase. Great staff and atmosphere is upbeat and family friendly. The chicken parmigiana is another good dish we usually order. I highly recommend Chase to anyone looking for an awesome affordable date night dinner!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,One of the best steaks and probably the best Italian in Santa Barbara!!  Romantic! Staff is terrific!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Waited what felt like forever only to find out that our waiter didn't get one of our orders in. We were about to leave the place at which point he showed up with food. Food was good but wait is too long.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Didn't get a chance to eat here because the hostess seated us outside (dog friendly) and neglected to provide menu, water or wait staff.   We left.... Terrible service!!!!!   Not like they were busy!  Go to Aldo's up the street!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Seriously this restaurant was amazing. It had a real old world Italian feel, with a downtown Santa Barbara twist. We loved everything we ate there, including the dinner salad that came before the meal (I got the Caesar salad and my wife the house salad, and both of them were so good we wanted more)! Our dinner was great and the prices are fairly reasonable for such quality food. And for dessert - the tiramisu - wow. An experience. It is homemade from the original 45-year-old recipe of one of Chase's original owners, I think. It was the best tiramisu I've had, and I have had some really good ones in the past. We actually wanted to go here again the next morning we loved it so much"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Had a party of 10 2+ hours in advance of a 7:00 show at The Granada. After 2 rounds of drinks and salads, still no food by 6:20. Needless to say, we were there for the show, not the food, but it would have been nice to enjoy it prior to. Difficult to cram chicken parmigian and pasta in 10 minutes. After 3 conversations with the manager and owner, there was no effort to make it right. Btw, food was excellent. Too bad we couldn't have had a better experience."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We went to the Chase about a month ago and our server forgot to put our order in. We have been going there for a while but we understand something thing happen and its not a big deal but we said something. We went back to the chase to have lunch last week because we really enjoy their food and Brussels Sprouts, but then we were confronted by the same server Nina because we had commented on the bad service before and it was really awkward and seemed very confrontational. We still love the food but we will be ordering to go for now on because the service is bad and hope it gets better."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Chase Bar and Grill have such a great atmosphere for dinner....excellent Italian food , fish and steak."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"A friend and I went here for lunch for the first time today, and I was thoroughly impressed. The reviews do this place no justice and I can only assume it has to do with bad experiences on busy nights. We had no problem getting an outside table at 1 p.m. (Thurs) and the service was extremely attentive the entire time, even though there were plenty of other people eating there. 

Not only was service great, but the food was EXCELLENT! One of my most satisfying Italian meals in a while. I got the Chicken Piccata and asked for them to add pesto to the side of Fettuccini Alfredo. YUM. YUM. YUM! I can't wait to eat the leftovers. And at  $12, fairly average for SB prices, I'd say it was a generous portion and extremely full of flavor.

I will definitely be back here soon."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I love the Chase! Great food and lovely ambiance! My favorite is the halibut!!!! Delicious every time!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"It's probably been 10 years since I've been here, but when hubby asked where I'd like to go for V-day, I chose Chase, and I'm glad I did! Cocktails were smooth and generous. Started with their homemade Caesar Salad, delicious! Veal Milanese melted in my mouth, so tender and fettuccine cooked to perfection! My husband had shrimp piccata with spaghetti and loved it. With Frank Sinatra singing in the background, the atmosphere was very romantic. Our waitress was professional, friendly and knowledgeable. We were spoiled for 90 minutes and loved every minute of it!! We'll definitely be back!! I'm sorry I haven't returned until now but glad I did! Thank you, Chase, for reminding me why I used to come here!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We loved this restaurant. The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is perfect. We had hours to kill before a concert (Brad Mehldau solo at the Lobero) and the staff was extremely accommodating. It's probably the best restaurant we've been to in Santa Barbara. We'll definitely be going back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We went for lunch yesterday and should have known since the place was almost empty that we should have gone somewhere else.  Food was marginal and when they gave us the bill they changed dinner prices instead of lunch prices.  Luckily we caught their deception and had them fix the bill.

No wonder why they tried to scam us. Hardly anyone eats there. Stay away there is much better food elsewhere."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I don't see how this place could have bad food. The food I had was wonderful! Nice service and ambiance too!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,As a Santa Barbara local I had one of the loveliest afternoons on state street at chase bar and grill! Noah provided exceptional service as our waiter! Very kind professional and funny!  The food was good and came out in appropriate time.I am beyond pleased  with every aspect and will be returning  on a regular basis!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"great service and food, Jonathan was a wonderful server and helped make the experience that much better."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I am giving the Chase Bar and Grill a 5 stars due to wonderful service by Todd the bartender and the atmosphere. This is a great place to get a drink on State Street in Santa Barbara. The bar is large and located next to a large open window where you can people watch. Todd the bartender was wonderful. He gave large pours of wine, and also let us taste some other types of wine.  They have happy hour prices from 3p.m. to 7p.m. The appetizers were okay nothing exciting but we were hungry and it left us satisfied. We will definitely be back and have a drink at the Chase."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Had dinner listening to Frank Sinatra and friends. The meal was great and the service was even better.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,We were early for lunch and they graciously seated us. The food was spectacular. My halibut was the best fish dish I have had in a long time. It was just so perfectly cooked. My husband could not stop raving about the calamari steak. The meal was relaxed but then we understand fine dining. We did not find the food salty at all and I often find restaurant food over salted. We loved it and it is now our favorite Santa Barbara lunch spot!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Very cool spot with a lot of character.  Wide ranging menu, great bar to hang out.  Food was A-Ok."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I am giving this place a 1 star because the service was not that great and the food was just ok. We were in a slight rush so I kindly asked the waiter if he can put a rush on our food because we had to catch a train. I specified that we only had about 35 min to 40 min time to eat and leave to catch the train. I ordered their rigatoni with meat sauce but requested pink sauce instead. The pink sauce is made with vodka, but you are not supposed to taste the vodka. Also, there was no other customers there, we were the only ones at the restaurant at this time, because it was around 5 pm, before dinner time, meaning they were not busy at all. When they brought my food and after a few bites, I noticed that I am basically drinking the vodka. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said I quote ""Well you wanted it fast, right?"" ummm. Does this mean you will then offer me less quality food? If you knew this was a possibility then why didn't you warn me? So I spoke to the manager and all he offered was to throw my pasta back in the pot. lol yeah like that sounds really appetizing, after I already added tons of cheese and spices, and sauces etc. so it turned out not that great at the end but then by the time they brought out my food, we had to leave, and I left with a tummy ache. Too bad they didn't offer at least a partial refund for their mistake and rudeness. Cheap restaurants like this will find 1 star reviews on here by me. Sorryy"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Ambiance is cool because of the lights and the kitschy decor, bar area is fun and their entree prices are pretty reasonable by Santa Barbara standards. 
Lamb chops were terrible; tough, sinewy and undercooked with a pile of garlic on top. Chicken piccata is overwhelmed with lemon."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I took my family here the other night for dinner and I was really hoping that this place was going to be awesome for my sisters bday.
     I spoke with the bartender because I wanted to give my card to the server so there would be no arm wrestling for the check and they took care of it - no questions asked.
   The service was impeccable.  Everyone was super nice, very efficient and everything was spot on.  The venue is also beautiful.  This is a lovely place to sit and eat and be merry.
However I just wasn't very excited about the food at all.  
   i ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was ok... somewhat bland - it wasn't bad - but it sure wasn't $20 good.
   The wife had the bolognese and she said pretty much the same thing.  It wasn't bad but not worth the price. 
    Dad had the veal and wasn't super impressed.

 Bottom line is that this place has great service, but the food is lacking strength."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I am vegan so I asked the waiter for any vegan options. He told me to get something with cheese :/ At that point I asked for him to just bring some steamed broccoli and spaghetti with olive oil...and it was all over cooked! Even the pasta!!! At an italian restaurant! Shameful. My boyfriend, who is not vegan, had the carbonara...also bland and mediocre. 

Would not recommend."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,We stumbled upon this place as we walked state street. Looking for a place to have lunch. The menu looked good so we walked in for a seat. The staff kind of shy?! Almost seemed not intrested? After ordering our server warmed up. I would suggest trying the hot sandwiches. The bread toasted to perfection and nice flavors in the sauces. Casual family friendly environment with good sized portion. We would try again if we are ever in the area.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Like other reviewers on this site and others have already noted, the hostess is borderline hostile, and in no way welcoming. Had a reservation for lunch for four, the restaurant was empty, and yet she seemed unable to seat us. Very odd and off-putting. 

Service was slow, as usual, but i did finally get my coffee refilled after asking two servers a total of five times! 

What a turn off when they wouldn't take our SB Axxess cards - two of us, of a party of four at our table had cards - it's ""buy one lunch, get one free"". There is no mention of 1 card per table in the guide. (What's the difference? Had we asked for separate checks would they have had to take it.) 

Meatball sandwich was a bit better than Subway and 5 x's as much money and took two hours all in all. I won't be back to use my Axxess card anyway."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Chase is my favorite restaurant in SB and I went to college there all four of my college years. Their Italian food is great! I always have leftovers and I always leave very happy. I am a BIG fan of fetuccini alfredo and Chase has one of my favorite's. Very creamy and rich :D. It's not overly pricey either for a fine dining atmosphere. 

It has wonderful, festive, and whimsical decorations complete with lots of Chritsmas lights and mirrors that really open the small dining room up to seem very large. The booths are very comfy, squishy leather. The restaurant started at least 20 years ago and my grandparents used to eat there with my aunt when she was at Brooks Photography School."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The location and atmosphere are incredible! They did an awesome job with the Christmas decor. I bar tended and worked the restaurant business for many years and know how much they rely on tips and word of mouth. My wife and I stopped in for a martini and mine was terrible. I mistakenly told the bar tender not to make mine too dirty, so he thought I wanted olive juice in it. I let him know the mistake and he didn't offer to make a new drink. You would think he would get the hint when I didn't have more than the first sip. I know he definitely got the hint that he should have made a new drink when I gave him a terrible tip. I do feel bad for both the bad tip and the bad review. I hope to give the place and bar tender another chance and would be happy to make up for the bad tip and review, but that's not going to happen until I have a better experience."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,My husband and I have been coming to Santa Barbara from Long Beach for at least the past 20 years and make a point of eating at Chase each trip! We love the ambiance . The bartender has been there for over 20 years and pours a great drink! Enjoy the chicken piccata~ it's great!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This place is THE BEST!!!

My mom and I have been coming here for the last 10 Years! She's been coming for even longer. It's a classic SB spot. The food is always phenomenal, the service is above-and-beyond. 

Holly was our server tonight and she was helpful, friendly, she got us EXACTLY what we wanted and even had great suggestions. 

Definitely the best Italian food in Santa Barbara!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I came here last week for my birthday with family and friends. Have the chicken piccata. Been here before, love their food. Our server was Christopher. He did a wonderful job Will ask for him again. There were six of us we had asked to be seated outside. Jason said we couldn't because it was not enough seating but a couple was leaving. Another couple came in and he gave them the spot. Also you need to read the very small print on the bottom of your menu gratuity is for six people. I've always thought it was for eight or more. I thought our server deserved more. Will go back but just ask for separate checks"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We had dinner here on the weekend, and wish we could get our money back.

The decor and ambience is aimed at a much older clientele, with ""old Italian"" being the most prevalent.  Service was below average.  Too pricey for what it is and what you get.

I ordered Chicken Marsala, husband ordered Chicken Picatta.  His minestrone was very salty.  My salad was minimal - romaine lettuce, carrot curls, meh.   The bread is awful, cheap white wonder-bread.  No butter.

The chicken in both entrees ($18.95) was dry at the edges and on the tough side in the middle.  A decent size portion, but both were so salty as to be nearly inedible.  Entrees came with a side of pasta, which was unremarkable.  No vegetables were available to substitute, only as a side order.  A tiny cup of grated Parmesan was dropped on the table for our entrees.  We asked for more, but it never came. 

When the waitress finally came back to see how we were doing (and it took a while), I said it was not that great, and way too salty.  She just said, ""Oh,""  walked away and didn't return. That was nice - not!  

Husband had a beer; I had an overpriced glass of wine ($12).  We both found ourselves drinking water to compensate for the excessive salt in the food.

As others have noted, the ""hostess"" is an elderly woman, dressed very casually in sweat-type pants.  She was polite, but it gives a weird vibe to the ""welcome"" one receives, especially at these prices. 

overall -- a waste of money.  We've walked by this restaurant many times and wondered about it.  Now we know -- never again. There are so many good restaurants on State Street and the side streets, don't bother with this place."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Diners who arrived after we asked our server ""Are you [name]?"" ""Yes."" ""We've heard a lot about you."" I don't know what they'd heard but but the service we got was quite lacking in competence. The server returned to confirm what we had ordered, even though it had been written and, after a long wait, the main courses came. Asking ""What about our salads?"" resulted in an obsequious apology repeated several times. We had our salads after but resented the additional time taken for the meal. There was also an error on the bill that was corrected as well as a couple of other, lesser, problems.

We've been to Chase several times and the food has consistently been good. One ought not let one poor experience negate the good things that Chase has to offer."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Amazing food and atmosphere.  Big dry martinis, excellent wines and Frank on the sound system.  We sat by the sidewalk on a perfect Santa Barbara evening and had one of the best date nights ever. Shout out to Victor, our waiter, very professional and helpful.  He gave full credit to Mario, the chef, for the incredible pasta sauces."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"So good!  The only bummer with this place is the Chicken Piccata is so good it has ruined it everywhere else.

Todd is a great bartender and a friendly face."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Brussel sprouts is good.
Soup and entrees are lukewarm. 
Clam Linguine is salty and oily, spinach veal ravioli is mushy from over cooked. 
The restaurant feels very cold; they kept the sliding door open wide during the 55F cold night time??! Why?Not very enjoyable."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I have always liked Chase Bar and Grill. Nice bar good food and friendly staff. If you're on state street looking for a great place to take a break this is it !
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Fantastic place! Great environment, food, drink and staff! Love The Chase, would recommend this place to anyone!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"To start off, we were pointed in the direction of Chase from another Italian restaurant in order to get a delicious cannoli. When we got there, we were greeted by not only the host, but the owner Jack as well. The atmosphere was extremely inviting and Jack was very gracious and friendly, throughout our entire time waiting for our cannoli to go. They guaranteed a visit from us in the near future. 

- Chris"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Horrible experience, the steak was very dry and chewy. Additionally the tortellini was stale. Not worth the price."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This is my favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara! Although a little pricey, the customer service is great, the food is amazing and it has a great ambiance. Perfect for if you wanted to get lunch or dinner with family or even if you wanted to take someone out on a date."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Do not eat here and if you do hold into your credit card.  The bus boy tried to give me my bill back without my credit card, when I asked him for it back he tried to convince me that I had lost it.  When I returned and asked to see the receipt they had created a new one and forged my tip and signature.  The manager backed him up the whole time and was very rude.  When I finally threatened to call the police the bus boy grabbed a envelop from behind the register which amazingly held my credit card.  The manager did nothing when she saw what had happened.  Do not eat here."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went tonight. And a sunday must be a bad day for a restaurant. It certainly is not the night you want to be at Chase... Awful! I had the french onion soup and I guess beef broth, a slice of Swiss cheese on top of a piece of French bread does add up to French onion soup but it was tasteless and cold! A bad combo. At least they did rezap it so it was warm! If it were me, I would probably avoid."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The ambiance is like a cozy fairy-light place that reminds me of Christmastime year-round. And at Christmastime, the fairylights go from ""lots"" to ""scarily over the top."" At least, that's what I've seen walking by the restaurant in the past.

Finally went there for the first time this weekend. I like the big booths, and the dark atmosphere that encourages intimate dining - could be with family, or a date. Either way, go with people you like to be with.
There were families and couples dining alike. 
I was surprised to discover the menu is predominantly Italian. I honestly had assumed this was more a steak and chops kind of place. Learn something new everyday, I suppose.

I had a veal dish, that came with soup or salad, and a portion of penne carbonara. Loved the pasta, it was amply packed with finely slivered bacon. The salad greens were crisp and fresh. I did think it was a little heavy-handed on the dressing - next time I would ask for the dressing on the side.
My dining companion had chicken provencial, with spaghettini and pesto.  We shared a tiramisu parfait for dessert. Our portions were generous, I was stuffed and only managed to eat half. Bill came to about $25/head.

Service was very attentive, from the hostess to the buser. Perfect on all counts.

A special touch of the night - women received a long stem white rose. Sure, it was probably for mother's day, and we were simply on a dinner date, but who am I to decline the gift of a flower?"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Visiting Santa Barbara and found this place..The margarita was great. The service was fabulous and so was the Pork  Chops.
It was my Birthday and they brought me a delicious chocolate cake .I recommend this place. The waiter and staff very gracious ..See you soon.."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"PROS:
- I like the romantic ambiance of this place. It's a small intimate place with a lit candle and a single rose on a table with white tablecloth. My bf and I went here on our trip to Santa Barbara for our anniversary. 
- This is an Italian restaurant. My bf and I both had spaghetti in meat sauce and the food was OK.

CONS:
- The place is somewhat small. The tables are too close to each other so you feel cramped and uncomfortable because you can hear others' conversations."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I have lived in Santa Barbara for quite a while.  I had always heard greag things about the Chase Restaurant and then I finally started meeting up with friends at least twice a month for the past year. 

I have never been disappointed.  Chicken Piccata, Stuffed Lamb Chops, Pasta Carbonara, Spicy Shrimp Salads, Hot Philly Cheesesteak, Raiders Fries, the list goes on.

The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is inviting.  Why did I wait so long?"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Old school circa 1979, the cozy, intimate banquettes and booths meant for conversation. Good hands at work in the kitchen."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,I used to love coming here. Not sure what happened 6 months ago to now but this food should have never set in front of me. I had a friend out of town and this is what they put in front of us. What a colossal disappointment.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We were sat by the hostess and were told someone would be right with us (the restaurant was maybe half full). 10 minutes later, no water, no waitress, no customer (we walked).  If you are in the service/restaurant industry and can't complete a simple task as delivering water and taking a drink order or paying attention to your patrons you might want to consider reevaluating your business model.  We will gladly spend our money elsewhere."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We arrived and were told to seat ourselves so we sat on the patio.  It took over 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to take our drink order and by that time we were ready to order our meal.  My husband ordered the meatball parm sub and when it came out, it was eggplant parm and we had to send it back.  The fries were more like potato wedges (but without any seasoning and not cooked thoroughly), they looked crispy on the outside, but were raw on the inside.  The meatballs, once they came out, were salty and burnt tasting.  I ordered the tuna melt.  The tuna had no veggies or mayo, it was just chopped/minced tuna with cheese on top which I had to cover in ketchup since it was so dry.  My side salad had lettuce with brown spots so was obviously not fresh.  I would not recommend anyone eat here, there are so many restaurants to choose from, I wish we had a better meal on our one afternoon in Santa Barbara.  I have read many positive reviews of this restaurant, but the people next to us also did not finish their meal and had to wait and wait to pay their bill and were getting extremely agitated by the poor service they received as well."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,We had lunch here with family. Everyone enjoyed there food! The asparagus soup was delicious. Order a cup of the white beans to put on your bread. So delicious!!! Everyone was super friendly.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Thank you Chase for such an amazing and rememberable dinner... My wife and I were visiting Santa Barbara for the day and came across this restaurant the service was superb the drinks were excellent my steak was cook perfect..our server was polite and well knowledgeable. You can expect a welcoming smile from Jack Who is the GM, and he wants to know how your night is going so he can make sure you have best possible experience pier in Santa Barbara . We will be definitely coming back.   And by the way if you can't decide on dessert you have to try the cannoli by far one of the best tasting treats I've had in my whole entire life thank you again!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I thought some of the reviews at first might be exaggerated but was there for the first time last night and wow it's all true. I specifically asked for a booth and although it was confirmed I would get it I did not. The hostess basically said ""oh well, sorry. If you don't want your table there are plenty of people that will want to take it"". Are you serious!?!?... I thought to myself. Wow. We were hungry so stayed but disappointed & just a terrible way to start having dinner. One of my friends came from a long way to visit this immensely over-rated place to eat. The food is good but big deal, that's a common variable if your a restaurant on popular state st c'mon. I can give hundreds of places that would put that place to shame in food quality. Anyhow, food was good not amazing. I'd say our bottle of wine was amazing but WE chose it so credit to us. Hostess was terrible.......waiter was a bit sarcastic & should mind his own business. Just stick to paying attention the first time & not have us repeat ourselves. We didn't need what he thought was a funny joke & side comments.

Definitely not going back to this place. I believe all the locals now that say it was great before but went downhill this last year. Change of management?? Who knows....."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I have been to Chase many times with some people that know the owners (full disclosure). Each time,  the place has been packed. The decor is quite interesting -- but is geared towards having a classic Italian feel. Although they take some heat for the 90 minute table limit - I have never been asked to leave nor have I gotten the stink eye from the servers to leave. 

Start off with the Caprese appetizer. I always go with the Chicken Picatta; However, the Chicken Milanese and Halibut Piccata have also gotten great reviews from friends. Cocktails are strong and rice pudding is the perfect finish on the night.

No espresso though - bummer"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,This place is great. Menu is small but good and healthy. Edgar took great care of us. Great experience!!!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"On my first day in SB I recall passing Chase and I saw the happy hour menu and wanted to go back the next day.  I ended up going and what a delight it was!  I was greeted by the manager who sat me at a lovely booth table.  When I mentioned I was here for happy hour he tkindly old me that the bar and the patio are the only places to get that, so I headed for the bar which was half filled.  Got cheap drinks and ordered the lobster mac and cheese, chicken carbonara pizza and a stuffed pepper for $5 each!  It took 20 minutes to get our food, but that was fine, we met some cool people at the bar, enjoyed the ambience and our drinks.  Once I got the food, it was all soo delicious!  I definitely want to go back and try the other food items on the menu.  The bartender engaged us in conversation and we had a pleasant time!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Tom makes a great drink! Definitely should come here for lunch! They offer a good selection of wine and have a full bar, definitely worth coming to, especially during the busy times of Fiestas! A good place to relax, drink and watch some of the parade."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My boyfriend and I planned to go here one Wednesday after work for a drink. We wanted to go to Chase because of their awesome Christmas decorations inside. When we walked to the entrance we were not greeted. 
I told who seemed to be the hostess that we wanted to grab a drink. After she tried to seat us outside, I asked if we could sit inside so we could admire the Christmas decorations. She tried to see if there was any room at the bar, which there was not. She did not give us any information on how long we would have to wait until we could be seated. When I tried to look inside for any extra room and to see how long the current patrons would be until they finished, the other girl at the front stated very rudely to us, ""the bar is full"". We walked straight out. 
The second hostess was very unfriendly and we will not be going back for another attempt at drinks."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,I'm not even going to give 1 star. Had reservations for party of 7 for work Christmas dinner gift exchange made 2 1/2 weeks in advance for 7:00. We were excited as we heard decorations were nice. They called day before canceling us as they had a party of 40.  They said they might be able to accomadate us at 4:00 or 8:30 neither time reasonable or we could schedule another day....humm don't think so Chase I will never eat at your restaurant or suggest your restaurant as your customers of 7 don't matter.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This is like having a romantic  meal in Italy! Currently Chase is decorated in  honor of Valentine's Day and President's day,Cupid flying around,roses on the bar,and hearts on the tables.. ""you can get your heart on"",according to Leo the bartender. Also an American flag for president's day..The wine list at Chase is exceptional. The menu offers a varied selection with each dish perfectly prepared. The service is outstanding. S.B.'s best kept secret"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This is a really cute rest on the northern part of State Street. The food is wonderful, the clam chowder (it was friday) was one of the best I've ever had. I think it had bacon?? I wasn't thrilled with the deep fried raviolis, too much pasta.  But my husband's steak was perfect med rare. The white beans were spicy and incredible. I would highly recommend it. The staff was friendly and attentive."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Book 'em Danno! No, seriously.. Chase is a must stop when visiting SB. 

I pass through the central coast for work quite often and there are dozens of decent places to eat. HOWEVER, it is rare to find an establishment that has great customer service, food, and atmosphere. 
I was waited on by Jonathan, he was professional and tentative. Jonathan was knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations.

Next time I pass through SB I'll be visiting Jonathan and the Chase again! Consider me an out of town regular."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I am giving this place 4 stars for the calamari. They prepare an excellent calamari steak a number of different ways and it is always tender and delicious. Chase is a very old fashion restaurant with a good bar crowd - a real throwback and very enjoyable. Christmastime it is really festive with even more decorations.  Getting back to the calamari, the provencale is not really a provencale, but it is pretty good."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Our food rating was mixed; mine was pretty good (eggplant parm) and my girlfriend characterized hers as so-so (veal with penne carbonara dish), but the dining experience was pretty bad;read on....

Service was mediocre,apparently because one single waitress was responsible for all of the tables.

My dish came with a pasta dish. In response to being asked if I wanted marinara or meat sauce, I chose the latter, only to find a $1.50 charge on the bill for meat sauce; clearly inappropriate, given that the extra charge had not been disclosed.

The restaurant was warm, and no breeze came though the open door; nonetheless, the Owner chose to leave the a/c off, or at least on a warmer setting. In response to our pointing out our discomfort, the Owner was not only unresponsive, but suggested that the solution was for us to buy more cold drinks!  When we later made further reference to our discomfort, he justified the lack of a/c by indicating that the a/c does not work as well when the door is open!
The Owner seemed more concerned with making us aware that he was the new Owner than addressing our issues.

This is too bad, because I had more pleasant dining experiences here years ago."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Honestly, we weren't even looking for Italian. Just happened to be walking on State St. and the smell enticed us in. As crowed as SB is on a Friday night before Summer Solstice we were seated right away. The staff was friendly and prompt. My husband got the chicken parmesan and I ordered the Pesto Ravioli with a side of alfredo sauce. They were both so delicious! Happy and full we both were talking about it the next day. One of my biggest problems with SB is that most of the restaurants are fully staffed by hispanics and it makes authentic food kind of random (unless it's mexican, but even then it tends to be very american) but this restaurant reminded me of the home made Italian food I grew up with. 
Worth every bite! (and calorie!)"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I was looking for a great bowl of pasta while I was down on State Street. There are a number of Italian places all grouped together, but I ended up at Chase Bar & Grill. I can't say that the decor is appealing. The twinkle lights seem a little cheesy and the overall atmosphere is a little overwhelming. They did have the World Series on the TV at the bar which was a plus.

Although it was slow when I walked in, it took more than 5 minutes for me to get any attention from someone to seat me. They looked over at me, acknowledged that I was there, but it was almost as though they didn't really think i was going to sit down.

When I was finally seated, they brought some water and some bread, the bread not very good. I ordered a glass of chardonay. It was pretty terrible, no one ever asked how it was, so I drank it anyway since I was paying something like $9 for the glass of wine. I ordered spaghetti and meat balls because that seemed to be a good option (I can't say I was inspired by the menu choices). The spaghetti was not very good. The sauce was a little spicy but nto that flavorful. The pasta was not cooked well. I'm not sure what the meat balls were made out of, maybe veal? It's unclear. They weren't that delicious. I only ate about 1/2 of it, felt over charged, and left.

The waiter's attention to me increased over time, but it took longer than I wanted to get the check and leave. Overall, not a great experience."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Started out with fried olives stuffed with goat cheese.  Very good, subtle flavors and addicting. The spaghetti with meat sauce was average, nothing special.

The service was friendly and very team oriented. Very professional.

The ambience was warm and inviting. The booths are a tad cozy so expect to rub elbows with strangers. It is small restaurant and it is a bit loud, but not so loud you cannot hear your party."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Seriously. The. *** BEST *** flavors, service, ambiance, & curb appeal!! Best, best, best!!! Such a favorite!!!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Stopped in last night while previewing for my birthday. The bartender made a great fresh margarita. He knows what he's doing. I just wish he was a bit friendlier. By the end of our drinks he did warm up a bit and gave us suggestions of other great bars to stop in.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Very good food. good service and the prices were not too out of control. The Drinks are done quite well.
Nice atmosphere and fast service. 
the only bad was the french bread was too soft, should have been garlic bread, but that could have been ordered...
but the food was delicious ."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We went for lunch today and maybe it was the unemployment report or the report that consumer confidence is slumping and 2009 is looking bleak, but it seemed to me that the staff at the Chase was REALLY HAPPY that people were dining there.  

b/c you know, if people don't have money, they don't tend to dine out as much... well, whatever it was, the hostess said: Thank you for joining us for lunch today.  In my head I was thinking: Wow.  

The service was great but the food was average.  We all got salads on account of the warm weather and they were all $13.95 or so.  Large portions, I couldn't even finish mine.  

The restaurant is smaller than I would have thought, but had an ambiance that reminded me of an SF restaurant, sort of small and kitschy with lots of mirrors and strange statues etc.  Cute cozy deco.  It's rather dim inside, but it makes for an intimate meal, probably better for dinner than a lunch.  But on the plus side, they have a good outside seating area that opens to State Street so it makes for some good people watching, I'm sure.  

Friendly staff, acceptable food.  I would go back for a drink or two."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Not sure what all the hype is over this. Never had anything above average here...
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"So the people are very nice, which is why I am giving two stars rather than one. The wine selection wasn't the best, and when the pasta came we could tell it hadn't been strained properly as the sauce became diluted and watery underneath. Not very appetizing. The food was just ok, but wow you could get way, way yummier stuff for less at say CPK."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Loved the cheese ravioli! It was presented so lovely that I dug in before i remembered to take a pic. I had no leftovers. I will order this again! The chicken picatta was enjoyed as well!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My husband just got home from deployment and we drove up from oxnard to come enjoy a sculpin and their amazing pesto bread which we love! Went and sat at the bar because it's a windy day, but we normally enjoy their patio. There was two empty seats and we thought we had scored! The bartender was closing out a group that had taken the majority of seats at the bar. And while they had gotten up two couples sat down in their place. We were never asked our drink order, or placed water or anything. The first couple was serviced, my husband looked at me and said if that other couple gets served before us, we're outta here! And just as he thought- THEY WERE!!! We were so hangry and disappointed. I have been a bartender for over 8 years, and that just isn't right! I will be talking to the manager once we finish our meal from Palazzio. Review on that place to follow."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"nice pour of whiskey.

nice lemon drop martini at a happy hour price.

nice decor with lots of magic lights intertwined with fake greenery.

nice bartender.

distastefully limp. greasy fries that took forever to arrive. now, tis true i'm not a fan of the steak fry, but if aforementioned fries are firm and have a crunch to them, i can definitely be made amenable. these, however, were sodden and heavy. finally the mister removed the plate from my offended fingers, telling me i didn't need to broadcast my french fry irritation by handling each and every fry only to drop them with a soft splat back on the plate..."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,This place is one of my favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara...especially during the hoildays!!! The ambiance is beyond great..the food is great...whether you sit inside or outside...my husband and i prefer outside...If you are looking for a cozy classy place to have a great meal and awesome drinks this is the place.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Great atmosphere, but the staff don't seem to care. Attentiveness to customers is careless. I was hoping the food would make up for it, but I got illl after eating what was a good Philly Cheesesteak; the aftermath was not pretty a few hours later.  Might try this place again. But will sit at the bar and not eat the food."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The good: the ambience/decorations and the service.

The bad: the fettuccine was overcooked and the ravioli was too salty.

Overall: This place has a lot of potential, but I feel like they try to do too much (Italian, Steak, and Mediterranean?)  They should limit their menu options and focus on getting the basics right (e.g. cooking times and seasoning)."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"One of our favorites, especially during the holidays. It is hard for a restaurant to hit all three corners on the triangle, good food good service and great atmosphere. Last night, Sunday 12/16/18 they hit 2 out of three. The one lacking was good service. Servers were doing their best, short handed for some reason. No bar tender so the table servers were making drinks. I sent my drink back. They fixed it but it took a while. Food was slow but excellent when it arrived. We will return. Been there to many times to know our experience was not the norm."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went there for lunch on a sunday, the place was pretty dead which normally would have put up red flags as a lot of other restaurants along state were packed...but took a chance.  The ambiance was really nice and intimate like a place you wanna order a  steak and scotch at.  The food was unremarkable but not bad, prices were inline with the rest of pack around 12-15per for lunch. Come for the ambiance not the food."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,My wife and I came here for our first dinner after our wedding! The steak was on point! The owner Jack greeted us personally at our table and made us feel very welcome!  We'll definitely come back to see our new friends!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"So disappointed on my birthday. I have been going to the Chase for over 30 years. Great Caesar salads, for sure, but my beloved Shrimp Provencial was horrible. The shrimp did not taste bad, it was literally indistinguishable as shrimp. And the sauce that the shrimp was in was different as well, it was much darker than usual - keep in mind that I have had this exact dish dozens of times.

When you go, at a minimum you ask if the shrimp is fresh - mine clearly was not. Literally tasteless.

Waiter was very nice and my friend had a (fresh) shrimp Caesar that he liked."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This place is like a funhouse, minus the fun.  And it just gets stranger as the meal goes on.

I stopped here with a couple friends passing through SB on a roadtrip.  We were wandering State Street looking for a meal and spied their happy hour menu so dropped in for a bite.  The decor in here is insane.  I guess that's a typical, over-the-top kitschy Italian place for you, but definitely don't pop in here for a romantic or relaxing meal.  We first sat at a table, being told the booths were reserved, and then discovered that happy hour only applied for those seated at the bar or patio.  As the bar was full, we braved the cold and rain to save a few bucks.  

Ordered every pizza on the happy hour menu, and a pasta and stuffed bell pepper.  First, the meal took about 30min to arrive.  Sans pepper.  Meanwhile, we had asked for bread after seeing a plate on a neighboring table, but that was forgotten, as well, and only arrived after the entire meal.  You really feel isolated on the patio- and it probably doesn't help that you are locked out of the restaurant.  The only entrance to the thing is through some giant, windowed doors behind the bar, that are impossible to open if anyone is seated at the bar.  Forget using the bathroom, let alone trying to go inside to hail a waiter.

On the plus side, the pizzas were good, and one of their attendants was very helpful.  However, can't say the happy hour was worth it."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,My husband and I were visiting from Texas this last weekend and decided to go out for a romantic dinner. We would highly recommend this restaurant. Our Server Lola was very professional and her knowledge of wine was very helpful. She even helped us pair our wine with our entrees. Overall a wonderful night in beautiful Santa Barbara.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I was Chase bar with my family. The dishes so delicious. All pasta food excellent taste. The price is good too. Fast service and clean restaurant. I recommend when you stay in Santa Barbara, to visit this place."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"My husband and I dined here on Thanksgiving night.  We decided to order one traditional and one Italian dish and share.  The turkey and gravy was so moist and it came  with stuffing,  garlic mashed potatoes, and pecan pie.  Our Italian dish was Chicken Piccata with a lemon caper sauce with a side of fettechini alfredo - so delicious!  Great service and great location on State Street as well."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I was walking down State Street and spotted this very cool looking restaurant. Frank Sinatra was playing, the decor was gorgeous so I hopped on a bar stool (there was nobody else at the bar) in eager anticipation of what was to come! Well, what happened was nothing. I had to wave at the bartender,who was 6 feet away, and say ""hi, how are you today?"" to get his attention. Seriously? He hardly said 2 words to me and when he was forced to talk to me he mumbled inaudibly. He had no problem talking to his co-workers though. Chatted them right up. So the food was good and the place looks cool but good grief they need to work on service!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Had the Veal. It was amazing!! Christina was an awesome server. Food and service were perfect!!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,This place was incredible!! Gets service and and even better food! The fish piccata with Alfredo and Mahi mahi with veggies was perfect! Great price and great food. Awesome!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We had a wonderful dinner tonight at Chase!
Even though the restaurant was full when we arrived, they found a table for us and we had excellent and fast service!
Seems like Chase was the place to be tonight!
A fun atmosphere!
Salmon was awesome as well as the piccata !   Thanks!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The ambiance is lovely with linen tablecloths, faux vines overhead lit with tiny white lights and fresh touches for Christmas. The five of us had a quiet booth at the back as requested so my elderly mother could hear our conversations. The booth was perfect. 

Two of us had calamari piccata, two had linguine with white claim sauce while the fifth enjoyed the fish piccata. The food was pretty good once it came. My only negative is that the service was beyond sluggish. 

Jack, the new owner, greeted us as we departed asking how everything was. I told him the above. 
I will return but will have wine and kick my heels up then so I can enjoy the long afternoon more and not wonder what on earth is taking so long."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I love chase. It is the most perfect restaurant in Santa Barbara !!
Try the pork chop. 
We take the train from LA once a month to eat here"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I have no complaints. Wonderful, I mean wonderful, starters of white beans seasoned perfectly and a hot cabbage dish before a good Cesar and halibut w pasta. Wine list is limited but good and local. Cudos to Todd at the bar. This is our go to place in Santa Barbara.
( this was written after visit Sept 2011, but somehow didn't get posted)"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Nice decor and big comfy seats. The dessert was really good and the bartender was really friendly despite the fact we were last minute late night diners. Get the cheesecake!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We had a reservation for 12 because we were meeting our family from different parts of California in Santa Barbara to have a celebratory Christmas dinner.  The deocrations were wonderful, which is the only reason for the one star.

My daughter and I arrived first.  We were not greeted by anyone, could not get the bartender's attention, did not know where to sit, stand or go.  Finally, my daughter told me that the old lady in sweats who was slurping down soup might be the hostess, although she had stared at us for 10  mintues and not had the courtesy of asking to help us.  Alas, I asked if she worked there and she said YES!  So we got to sit down at the table that had been set for our party.

After two very bad tasting appetizers and a few drinks, almost our entire party arrived.  Even though we were ordering food and drinks, we were almost immediately told that we had to leave in an hour because they were booked, and they were quite rude about it!  It was shocking to be told to hurry after travelling far to come to this particular restaurant.

The waiter took my salad before I was done because, as he put it,  ""the entrees are ready!!""  The food was pretty bad overall, although my husband's rolled eggplant was good.  My picatta was good for a few bites, then was too lemony to finish, the pasta was gluey, the meatballs were hard as a rock; but that much we could handle;  the service was the reason we will never go back there - and we recommend you do the same.  There are plenty of other choices in beautiful Santa Barbara!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Excellent food!  Had the best cosmopolitan martini.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Totally unexpected goodness on the actual night of my birthday ... we had a long day out on the town, hiking, the mission, walking to the beach the length of state street, then seeing Malcolm Gladwell at the Arlington (wow) .... and decided we wanted somewhere quiet with a good bar - we were very late on Friday when most places were already closed.  We wound up going into this place because  a very nice lady at the end of State Street (divine inspiration gallery) gave us this business card as she pointed the newbie tourists down the right way onto State (at the very early part of our day) ....

The bartender was like an old friend ... very cool and unpretentious ... the waitress was equally comfortable and never made us feel rushed even though we closed the place down ..... the guys in the back who do dishes and clean the floors - everything behind the curtain, came out at the end to take care of all that needs attending to and they just struck me as salt of the earth kind of guys ... I made a point to give them each a personal tip .... THE PEOPLE of this place made my birthday really special.  I just felt the love and care and humanity - the main reason people go out to eat (besides not having to cook themselves).

The drinks were generous - exceptional - the flatbread with procuitto and arugula was amazing ... the arugula was the sweetest peppery-est, freshest I've ever had!  They brought it out with a red chile oil that we drizzled on it ... wow, great unexpected depth.  We also enjoyed a great warm spinach salad with crispy chicken on it, which could have been horrible, but it was really really good! and that was in addition to high end thick bacon.  We couldn't eat it all .... yet we stayed for a great multi-layer rich dark chocolate cake dessert complete with birthday candle ... and they made a fresh pot of decaf for me with a smile .... the whole experience just warmed my heart.  

I can understand why people don't go in ... the decor is very guy-ish, kind of old school tacky even with christmas lights up year around and faux plant/ivy garland hanging from the ceiling .... this isn't an obvious stand out, but I urge you to go in and chat with the bartender .... let hipness go and just enjoy a genuine meal with genuine people who aren't jaded by years of serving tourists ..... 

Chase, we salut you!  Thank you again for a special birthday evening."

Nice Christmas decorations every year. Cute and cozy place for a stiff drink all year round. So glad they extended happy hour, we'll be here more often now."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"The staff is sooooo nice and friendly.  Thank goodness there is still a classic, classy, genuine, good serviced restaurant still in Santa Barbara.  I had chicken picatta with Fettuccine alfredo. It was unbelievable.  Also had the Italian pinot grigio on the wine list that was excellent. I will be frequenting this place more often, thank you!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Blackened salmon caesar salad was amazing, and the service was great as always! I will definitely be back soon."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I had been wanting to try this place for a while now and it didn't disappoint. Great ambiance and atmosphere inside and everyone was really nice. I grew up on the east coast in the New York area and have been looking for a restaurant that makes good chicken parmigiana. It was honestly the best chicken parmigiana I have had since moving here and hands down the best in town. Try it!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Great Italian ambiance.. service and good is excellent!!  Sinatra drink .. Blue Eyes... and music:-))
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Really cool ambience with all the lights inside and the booths have a really cool look to them. Food was pretty good, i had the spaghetti with meat sauce and my girlfriend had the ravioli. Both enjoyed both dishes. Service was decent, waitress was prompt and made for a smooth meal. Would go back, but there are some better italian restaurants in sb."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Good service, good food, and terrific portions.  Our waitress was awesome!  All the seafood was jumbo sized and fresh!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We just left Chase. Our dinner was so great, Rosa was our server, she was on spot on every point. My husband ordered Lasagne and I had Chicken Piccata.  Both meals were excellent. Rosa was the shinning point of our evening. We normally have our favorite waiter (Edgar) but sadly he was not working this evening, However, Rosas  sweet personality won us over. We will be back soon."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I gave Chase Bar and Grill a single star rating for customer service which was rude and unprofessional at best. We did not stay to try the food as the initial impression was so poor. There are many wonderful places to eat in Santa Barbara.  I would't wast my time
or money here."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This place has a nice atmosphere, but the food is overpriced and average. Also, I was walking by there with my gf once and we were checking out the menu when the greeter comes up to us and suggests that we could probably 'split an entree'! I guess I looked cheap..."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I absolutely love Chase. It's quirky, but romantic at the same time. The glowing twinkle lights, deep leather benches, and cozy interior gives this State Street gem a soft, warm feel that perfectly complements the hearty Italian fare. In honesty, there are Italian restaurants with better food (Via Maestra and Tre Lune can't be beat), but Chase has the location and that 1950's-style-neighborhood-restaurant vibe that tugs at your heart strings and just makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I was in having lunch last week or so. Wed. There were two girls behind the bar and one gal just talked endlessly about how cool it would be to live in a trailer park and that they could party all night and get up late in the day for work.This was so tacky considering the place is so nice. I did not want to hear this during my entire lunch. The other tall waitress was attempting to not engage with  the other short girl with dark hair. Not sure I will return. I use to go there years ago, in fact went to the one on State St. many many years ago. I must say the food is not nearly as good as it use to be."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"They have the best Chicken Picatta in town, it is so delicious. Their pesto penne pasta is great served with it. Their Caesar salad is amazing and their lasagna is also so delicious all meals are served with wonderful hot bread and butter. This is one of my favorite places to eat if you want Italian. Oh I forgot about the minestrone soup so delicious and their clam chowder is delicious as well."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,This place was great! Came here for dinner with some friends. The staff was very accommodating and took very good care of us. The atmosphere was beautiful. The food was delicious! Highly recommend the chicken fettuccine alfredo! :)
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Outstanding Italian. Great service, super friendly & accommodating staff. 
One of my favorite Santa Barbara Italian dining . 
You can BYOW for $ 20 corkage. 
Favorite of locals in the know."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I work downtown and the lunch specials are great.  For under $10.00, there is a great variety.  I like the Chix Parm Sandwich w salad."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I want to give more stars because of how awesome it is that this restaurant has been in town so long, family owned, friendly, some of the employees are pretty long-term...and when a restaurant is around this long, it is doing some great things. I have gone here several times through the years and am grateful that is survives. That being said, there really are some issues that annoy me every time I go 1) Someone please find a regular schedule to do deep dust cleaning. All of that decor and decoration has been there for so long, there is years of disgusting dust clinging to it and it is over our heads so I can only imagine the gross stuff that is dropping into our food. 2) When things are that dusty, it makes you really worried about the deep cleaning in the kitchen. 3) The carpet has to go!!! I watch the busers pour water into glasses with it all pouring all over the floor. It is old and certainly has mold in it. Going straight to hard wood would be easier to clean and modernize the place a bit. 4) The mezanine looks terrible with all the random junk up there. 5) The food is so-so. I go there for the history, the community and the appreciation that it has been around so long but all of the things above prevent this place from being a first choice stop."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Used to come here as old SB classic, but under new ownership. I went in after concert early (5:30). there were plenty of tables, but when we were seated, we were totally ignored (yes we are friendly/smily :-) ) for half an hour. Finally I flagged down someone and asked to order a drink and get a menu.  I received my glass of wine, but my partner never received his margarita. Another half an hour, I flagged down someone, and got menus, ordered, received our marginal dinner ($10 split charge; many places don't charge for that)... the only good thing was, it was such glaringly horrid service our server comped our drinks.  Wouldn't go back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I was looking for lunch with outdoor seating to soak up Santa Barbara's amazing weather and walked by this place. Started out with the bread basket - loved that it came out with fresh Parmesan cheese! I ordered the shrimp Caesar salad and a glass of wine. The salad was great - dressing was on point, shrimp was perfectly cooked. Quick service and just absolutely loved the outdoor seating!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Having just returned from the Chase Bar and Grill, with friends, our experience, thanks to Cammy, our bar tender, was outstanding. While a martini can be generic, Cammy definitely was not. She made our experience one of Santa Barbara's best.  

Thank you Cammy. 

The anniversary couple.  Debi and Greg."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Well first a huge thanks to Mario for absolute first class service. Really outstanding. Secondly, the food was fabulous. This is the place for classic Italian food with FLAVOR. Not like ""Olive Garden for the masses"" but ""We're serious about making great food"". Highly recommended!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Came for lunch with my family, it was our first time as we are from out of town and had never heard of Chase. 
The ambiance was so cute and festive for Christmas; it had an intimate feel.
Unfortunately are service was not that great: the hostess did not seat us right away when we first walked in, she had to see what was available...even though about four tables in the back where they sat us were free and you can see the whole restaurant from the front door (it was snooty of her).
Then our server didn't actually greet until 10 minutes after we were seated. 
It then took about another 10 minutes for us to receive our bottle of wine (we actually watched it sitting on the bar with our glasses for 5 minutes when the bartender noticed us staring at it and brought it over right away; his service was great..he should be the manager!!)
Our server never brought us bread, however we did notice other customers receiving complimentary bread as they first sat down.
We finally had to ask one of the hostesses to bring some after our food was already ordered.
Our server came by one time during our meal to ask if everything was ok, then once we were almost done he finally provided water.
The food was very good and the bartender was great!
As for the hostess this day and our server...much less than should be expected of a pricier restaurant. It was disappointing. I think because we were not ""regulars"" we were deliberately being ignored. Not to sound dramatic, but I've had friendlier service at McDonalds (truly)."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Had a terrible experience. Walked in to be greeted by someone other than the hostess. He asked us how many were in our party and then walked away and said that a hostess would be right with us. Then the hostess walked up and was very rude. When we asked if we could sit on the patio, she said ""I already said that."" After 10 minutes of sitting on the patio and getting no service, we got up and left. Terrible vibe. Terrible customer service. We won't be returning."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Nice atmosphere, great people watching when sitting on patio. Food service very friendly but correct order spotty and food average."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"********??
We have been a long time patron of the restaurant, however the food was fantastic as ever...
The bartenders were clueless, did not know the menu, did not have a clue where the food was to be placed as it came..up..

Complete disaster for an up scale restaurant.
Hostess need to understand this restaurant is not a fast food place, as they turned away customers..

Highly recommend owners to get on board, and fine tune this establishment..before it sinks..

Now this is my second visit, as I observed to be the same..

Unhappy customer.."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Came here tonight craving some good Italian food.
The service was great and our waiters were attentive and kept refilling our water glasses and bringing us more bread.
The decor is also very nice. Very quaint and lots of cute Christmas decorations.
The seating, however, is cramped and there are only about 20 tables in the restaurant.
I have mixed reviews of the food: I ordered the ravioli with Alfredo sauce and chicken piccata. Maybe it was just the combo of the ravioli with the Alfredo, but to me it tasted odd. The chicken piccata, however, was amazing! It was the best chicken piccata I have ever had. 
Overall, I will be back to order the chicken piccata and try out a different type of pasta."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Chase, what has happened to you?  Slow, inattentive service, a fish sandwich McDonalds could beat, even the iced tea was weak.  We've been coming for years and are sorely disappointed.  Won't be back soon."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This was one of the worst dining experiences EVER! I'd rather sit at the DMV for 4 hours than spend another minute at this restaurant. Came here for a bachelorette dinner. The food was mediocre but the service was absolutely terrible. Sat down and was told ""let's hurry up to expedite your meal"", not to mention the drinks were terrible, server walked away while taking orders, unwilling to accommodate a dairy allergy, and simply did not listen to the order. We're told we could split the bill for 10 and it took 1.5 hours to deal with the bill. Worst decision to have a special meal at this restaurant. Will never recommend to anyone in Santa Barbara or traveling there. In addition, this should NOT be a 100 restaurant on opentable."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We originally had a reservation at Olio and Limone,but they ""lost"" it. I'm really glad they did. We walk. In and It looks exactly like the first restaurant I ever went to in Rome. We got waited on right away,by the nicest waitress . My husband got linguines and clams,mother in law veal ,and Father in Law the cioppino.I am eating my leftover penne carbonara as I write this. So here's breakdown


Service:Very nice attentive staff . The waitress tried really hard to get my father in law blue cheese olives for his martini. It wasn't that important,but that is a sign of great service

Alcohol: they had a full bar and a lot of wines available.

Food: You get  large portions. The  fish and shellfish were extremely fresh. All of our pastas were the right texture and not overdone on the sauce. (I personally hate when a place drowns the pasta in sauce) The style is very New York Italian,but on the lighter side .

Atmosphere: Think Little Italy. I believe they are New York Italian. There were pictures everywhere of New York and of course Sinatra. He was playing on the background music too. Really mellow vibe ,and not snobby. Of course they had red leather booths.

Parking/reservations/busyness : public parking was very close. We got in right away . My father in law called and they had a table waiting for us after the ""lost "" reservation at olio e limone wasn't found . It was very comfortable for a Saturday. A lot of regulars from the looks of it. 

Overall a good little spot, that doesn't ""lose""your reservations ."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"On our most recent trip to Santa Barbara we stumbled upon this amazing little Italian restaurant. The second we walked in we were greeted with such kindness and an overall welcoming vibe. We sat at the bar and the martinis were on point. We ordered a Cesar salad and I asked if I could buy dressing to take home it was that good!! The service was outstanding the entire time and the food was beyond amazing. It was such a great atmosphere, I highly recommend!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Great place for specials! Lunch is a steal and evening cocktails see a heavy pour. Pasta is just right and that wedge salad! Sit at the bar or out front for great people watching/ a SANTA Barbara treasure in the heart of town- 
Management- raise the barstools- I feel a bit like a 1st grader needing a phone book to reach my food."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Stopped in here for a quick bit trying to avoid traffic on the 101 coming home.  Had set out to go somewhere else down the street but they were closed.  I think i would go for like 3.75 stars if i could but i'll kick up the stars to 4 since our waiter didn't charge us to split our meal (said $5 on the menu).  We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the penne carbonara and i guess that isn't typical to go together but we went on a recommendation of the waiter.  Thought the dinner salad size caesar was quite good and the penne was yummy!  i like the chicken but thought it was a tad bit on the salty side.  Our waiter, although he was pleasant never once actually looked at us and looked as if he would have rather been any place else on the planet.  But he was courteous and our food came out in a timely manner.  All in all, a good experience!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"$5 for a cup of coffee that was not refilled. Nor the glass of water. Got the mahi mahi with vegetables for lunch. It was okay, though a bit dry. Our waitress was indifferent. I've had much better meals here so this one was a huge disappointment."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My boyfriend and I visited two weeks ago, although the food wasn't very good we had a nice experience sitting at the bar and chatting with the bartender while watching the football. When we left we said we wouldn't go back for dinner but it was a good atmosphere for drinks after dinner. Fast forward to when we checked the credit card and we realized he completely scammed us. Lucky for him I had taken a picture of the receipt. We paid w a card and left tip in cash, and amazingly we have a 20% tip to the cent added into the bill on our credit card. Disgusting!!! Never give them your service."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"How long has the Chase been in business at this location?     I guess to put things in perspective I remember when Aldo's opened across the street.   The Chase had already been in business as long as I can remember!    I still consider Aldo's the ""new"" place and would always choose the Chase instead!    

Chase used to have a lot of restaurants in this town.   Did you know that the Denny's on upper State was once a Chase?   

I like the Chase!  It is kind of old school, the type of Italian restaurant where ordering spaghetti and meatballs still seems like the right thing to do.   I think that their food is very good, always comes out hot and the portions will fill you up!  

But Chase has evolved too, their bar is GREAT and they know how to make a good drink.   Recently I went on one of the Crown the Town events and the chase was competing with El Cielito, Milk and Honey and Palazzio for best margarita.     Chase certainly served us an amazing margy!   

I hope that the Chase suvives another 40 or so years!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Hey A/C was broken was so hot inside. My wife had ravioli pesto she said it was good. I had fettucini alfredo it was so so but penne carbonara was really good.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Ate here tonight. Absolutely delicious food. The moment we arrived we were greeted by a wonderful hostess. The ambiance was great. The food was extremely flavorful. I will definitely be back again.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Horrible service.  Mediocre food.   Overpriced.   There are so many better options in Santa Barbara.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I cant decide... 4 or 5 stars?

I have eaten here probably 15 times. I LOVE it and have to have more every time I come. It is a Santa Barbara MUST and I recommend it to everyone.

Yes, the place is cool. The ambiance is magical, to me. lol
 This is a place to come relax, take time to sit back! Have a glass of wine, or a diet coke for all I care. Relax and enjoy yourself. We arent in LA, we are in SB.. hellloooo!

Ive tried a number of things on the menu, all of them are my favorite thus far. ha!

I will go back every day, every time Im in SB. No doubt about it."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We had some good appetizers 
Fried ravioli , caprese, and bruschetta. It was all tasty . Their menu is simple was busy when we came for a late lunch 
Service was great."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"The reason I chose Chase was it was what I wanted, Italian and on Open Table. I have physical disabilities (you wouldn't notice looking at me) and standing in a long line to wait just doesn't work for me. I consider myself a ravioli snob and Chase did not disappoint. I wish there was more filling but the flavor was excellent.  Definitely top 5. Service was a little slow asking several times then being offered. I was disappointed with the waiter. We had already ordered the Clam appetizer which was a hit. But before we received it someone in our party ordered the mussels. It was the exact same dish, flavor and everything just one was clams and the other mussels.  He should have spoke up and explained the similarities and maybe suggest something different. It was quiet probably because State Street was closed to cars and it was over 100°."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Wow! My boyfriend and I came down from Oregon and it was recommended here by some locals.  I don't know who they were but I wish I could thank them!  The ambiance was wonderful.  Our lovely server's name was Lola.  We sat outside and yet she made us feel right at home! She helped guide us towards an epic summerland Chardonnay. I highly recommend the Salmon.(perfectly cooked)my boyfriend had the Cioppino luckily we are good at sharing!  A++ We will be back that is for sure!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I gave them a call to see if they were still serving and the voice at the other end of the call was... well, less-than-friendly. I surmised that the restaurants in the area weren't used to a brisk late night stream of customers. We settled on another place to eat but my first impressions of Chase left me thinking they were just meh."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Their chicken piccata, homemade pesto ravioli, rib eye steak, shrimp scampi, calamari, pecan cheesecake and cannoli are amazing! Because of their efforts while facing COVID I give them 4 stars. I will say service wasn't super prompt at dinner but they were doing their best. I went for lunch and Edgar was prompt and very attentive. They have a pianist on Friday's and Saturday's in the evening which I experienced and liked. I return because I enjoy their food and ambiance."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I actually work @ the Chase and I have never been happier working anywhere else. Our staff now has built been to be nothing but the BEST! I truly love them all. I even hang out here when I don't work and live off the food. Seriously. All our guests are some of the most amazing people to meet. The ambiance is so romantic and comfortable. Oh... and we are decorated for Christmas NOW! Its so beautiful. Looking forward to seeing you soon!!!!!!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went there for lunch, ordered a Greek salad with all the  ""typical"" ingredients listed so it sounded safe.
When it came, it had mushrooms and bell peppers
Yuck-should have sent it back. Very disappointed-not sure if we'll return."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This place has a GORGEOUS Italian setting. I was observing nearly every part of the inside while waiting for the food, which didn't take long at all. 
My boyfriend started with a potato soup, really thick and creamy. After I tried some of his, I went ahead and ordered myself a cup as well. 
He had the fet Alfredo pasto, which he loved. Really creamy & cheesy with a generous amt of chicken.
I had a Greek salad, and added salmon. The dressing is to die for and the salad was delicious! 
Service was great, forgot the servers name but he was awesome!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"It's gone way down hill ever since the ownership change. Quality just isn't the same and it doesn't feel like the neighborhood place it used to be. They'll also decide to cancel your to-go order whenever they feel like it, even 40 minutes after you place the order."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Had apps on the parklet today--everything was amaZing! Calamari crispy and delicate, steaMers just gigantic!! Flat bread so yummy, and fried raViolis just the right amount of decadent. Plus the ""provako"" was like this exotic cabbage salsa that complemented the sourdough bread provided perfectly.

It was nice to bump elbows w locals and owner, alike--and our service courtesy of Gio--was spot on.

I heartily recommend you treat yourself to the same!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I've been searching for a true authentic Italian restaurant since the Original Joe's in San Jose went down hill in the late 80's and my wife and I are glad we stumbled across The Chase Bar and Grill as we had a fantastic dinner from their homemade Wednesday night chicken noodle soup to the 45 year old butter pecan cheesecake recipe along with the chicken parm which I had and the salmon which my wife enjoyed thoroughly. Two stiff cocktails... thanks and a NA Buckler for me. 
Happy hour menu looked great however we had just missed it. Next week!
 it will be our new stopping point between No Cal and So Cal 
Service was OUTSTANDING!!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We went here to celebrate my cousin's birthday and had a great time.  From outside it looked like any other restaurant, but once we got inside we discovered a fabulous 'Italian Bistro'.  

The entree's are definitely large enough to share.  I had the grilled salmon with vegetables special, which was delicious, and even though I'm a big eater I could not finish everything on my plate.  My cousin and her husband split an entrée spaghetti and said it was definitely enough to fill them up.  Everything we had, even the bread basket, was delicious.  

When our waiter found out it was my cousin's birthday he brought out a beautiful piece of chocolate layer cake.  What a nice surprise!

I'm anxious to return and try their flatbread.  It looked delicious, but we had no room to fit it in!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Never disappointed in the food at Chase! And the portions are very generous. Not only was the lasagna very tasty but my husband and I shared it because the serving was so large!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Very disappointed. Didn't try the food but ordered a slice of cheesecake to go. I was excited because I heard great things but when I picked it up I was charged $10.75 and the slice was smaller then the slice you get at Jack N the Box. I would have said nevermind but i had already ordered it. I wasn't that good either. Tasted like banana. Still annoyed that the slice was that small for $11!!!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Food was average. Service was terrible. Our waitress felt like we were an inconvenience and the place wasnt full either. Also ridiculous price for splitting a dish. It was 1/2 the cost of the dish itself, which our waitress failed to mention when we made our order."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We were walking through Santa Barbara, and came across this small restaurant.  We glanced at the menu, noted that it looked pretty good, but continued down the street to keep our options open.  A couple hours later, we were starting to feel hungry and decided to grab dinner here.

We got the lamb chops with balsamic salad and spaghetti in marinara sauce, as well as the calamari piccata with french onion soup and alfredo linguini.  The salad and soup to start were fine, but dinner took a bit longer than I expected to come out.  When it did arrive, the lamb chops were cooked absolutely perfectly, and the calamari steak was the best I've ever had.  However, both the spaghetti and linguini left something to be wanted.

The feel of this place isn't all that authentic Italian from the pictures and decorations, but I felt it more from the fellow customers.  At three different tables around us were groups of people speaking fluent Italian to each other.  This definitely added some bonus ambiance.

While their main courses are wonderful, the restaurant could work a bit more on their side dishes.  Still, I'd love to return here next time I'm in Santa Barbara."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Food is satisfactory but good luck getting service if you are I woman. On many occasions I have been completely ignored. No eye contact from bartender, waiting for a menu and frequently needed to leave my table to hunt someone down to ask for the check."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Look!! Caper sauce and tomato sauce just don't blend
With the veal and the veal tasted like it was not breadcrumbs but  a Chinese dish egg foo yong
It was not good.

 The veal itself was tender and delicious the breading the caper sauce horrible

Service was excellent Caesar salad was fine atmosphere was great but Chef you got to work on that

Ashlyn very pleasant young woman"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I regret not checking the more recent reviews before coming here. This used to be one of my favorite places to go in Santa Barbara, but I'm not sure we will return after tonight. We were seated pretty quickly, bread and water was served to our table. However, we placed our food orders at 7:30 and at around 9:10 inquired if they could give us an update on our food. When no one returned I told another person that we would like to just pay for our drinks and leave. Someone else said they would check on our food. Then I asked a second time and explained it had been two hours now and that if it wasn't ready we would just like to pay for our drinks and leave without the food. I handed them my card and explained I only wanted to pay and leave. Then, another 10 minutes passed and our server who knew at this point we were unhappy. Then, she walked out with our plates asking if we were sure we didn't want it. I said no that we had told 3 other people we wouldn't be staying, they had taken over two hours. It's outdoor (that's fine, Covid) but it's late now and we don't want to sit in the cold any longer. But now, with our plates in hand it seemed as if we had to pay. I told her I felt like we had been held hostage because I mentioned to 3 others I did not want to stay. Then, I asked if she could just box up the food since they had now made it. They did, but when we got home the food was just ""ok"" and not the kind of meal you would like to eat out of a to go box. They did give us a discount for our experience, which I appreciated. But I do think management needs to step in and fix some of these poor service issues. We had a child with us, it would have been easy to get her kids pizza out first so she could have at least eaten. Someone could have checked in on us or offered some more bread or drinks in the mean time. I'm not sure what was going on tonight, but I am pretty bummed as this used to be one of my favorite spots. Other reviews mentioned different experiences based on race / color and I'm not sure if that had anything to do with our experience tonight-- but it was so terrible that it crossed my mind at one point."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I ate here for the first time yesterday and it wasn't bad. I think the environment is what it's more about. We started off with the mussels appetizer and let me tell you those mussels were DELICIOUS. I loved them! I loved them so much I packed the juice they were soaking in, so that I can take it home! I would definitely recommend those as an appetizer:) Then I got the side of fries which came out in a timely manner and they were nice and hot, which is a big plus! The soup was okay, I feel like it could of used more flavor. The reason that this place didn't get 5 stars was because when our main course got there, I could tell they were sitting in the window for a while. The pasta sauce had settled and the top layer was all mushy. But the service was amazing and overall I would go back :) 
Their shrimp in the garlic sauce is amazing too if you like garlic. I would recommend the mussels and the garlic shrimp"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Seriously, what isn't to love? If you follow my reviews, you will find a common theme. I absolutely ADORE places in Sabra Barbara, my home town, that retain their quaint but legendary charm. They've had the same chef for nearly 40 years, and he has these authentic Italian dishes down to a science. My family and I have been coming here for 35 years. I don't think we've deviated from our personal favorites very often. My dad gets the calamari piccata, my mom gets the salmon, I get veal parm. I've never been disappointed in 35 years, which is a pretty amazing track record. Todd, who tends bar, has become a legitimate family friend over the last quarter century, as I'm sure is the case for so many other locals. Upon walking through these doors, I feel welcomed with open arms, comfortable, and 100% sure my family and I will have a great dining experience. We especially love to come here during the holiday months because their decorations are over the top and so incredibly beautiful. We love this place for all the right reasons: The food, the people, the ambience, and the friendships we've formed here over the last 3 decades. I love that old Santa Barbara Charm, and this place is chalked full of it. I hope they never change a thing...... upon reading other reviews, I see that see other people are less than impressed. I come here about 5-6 times a year, and tonight was as great as always. I noticed it was remarkably slow for a Saturday night. I sat at my same seat, ate the same thing, served by the same guy I've known more than half my life, and everything was great! I know the ownership has recently changed, and I implore them not to change this place too much. My 5 star review reflects tonight's experience and every other experience I can remember. I hope I can expect the same quality experience for the next few decades. I love this place."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"One of the best restaurants in Santa Barbara.  I lived there in the 80's and the original (lovely older couple) sat with us and other patrons.  Once time they shared two of my favorite recipes and wrote down the ingredients on a napkin that I still have today.  Homemade caesar dressing and the calamari piccata.  Great memory!  

I been back many times over the years and always get that same nostalgia from their great cuisine and atmosphere.  Small, always busy, stand and meet new friends and enjoy a nice glass of wine.  Thank you for staying consistent while serving amazing food with a very fun atmosphere.  One of few restaurants that serves shredded parmesan (as much as you want ) to enjoy with great fresh french baguettes.  Full menu and all freshly prepared.  Make this one of your stops while visiting Santa Barbara.  Steph"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Could've been better. Ordered the ciopinnio it was beautiful and most of the seafood textures were on point but had no kick or flavor. Needed sodium badly. I was sad because the halibut on top of the dish was cooked to perfection but tasted like nothing. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his veal Parmesan. 

It was our anniversary and usually places make a big deal of that but this was the first time in 21 years no one at the restaurant cared. We feel the patrons at the restaurant suffer because of the to go and delivery responsibility the restaurant has is exceptionally high. For the history of this place we were sadly disappointed. One thing that stood out was the house Caesar dressing that was Amazing."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This is my ""go to"" Italian restaurant in SB. I've never had a bad meal here. Prior to covid, I came in for lunch and always sat at the bar and had a Firestone beer with my meal. For dinner, it's the perfect ""date night"" kind of place and a place to go for celebrations. Very good selection of wines. It's casual and very affordable, overall. Don't get me wrong, I can afford to go anywhere but I chose this restaurant often because it's always GOOD. Anything with Alfredo sauce is excellent (they really get it right). For dinner, I like the eggplant Parmesan with tomato sauce and Alfredo sauce on the noodles that come with it. Also the Caesar salad is always flawless. I have also enjoyed their shrimp. For lunch, I like just about everything including the eggplant parmesan sub. I have noticed that they are taking all required precautions for covid when it comes to alfresco dining. I look forward to eating inside again when there's a vaccine."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Had lunch here during a weekend getaway in downtown SB and had a great overall experience! The ambiance is intimate and the whole place was decorated with beautiful christmas lights for the holiday season. Our server was very attentive and offered to make us sangria off the menu (I was craving the drink and asked before exploring the menu, he was more than happy to make it work for me), which turned out to be delicious! 

I had the halibut piccata with alfredo and a side caesar salad. The proportions and price were very fair and the food was great! I recommend this place to anyone in town!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Visit was on 6/18 5PM. To start the older woman at the podium looked very unhappy to be there. She was not welcoming. Not friendly at all. Not one smile. Secondly, our server seemed very uninterested when we were placing our order and was not personable at all. My partner and I both received the wrong salad and soup. They also brought out the wrong entree! This was our first time here and first expressions are everything. We will not be back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Chase appears nice on the outside, but the food was mediocre at best, certainly not worth the price. My mom got terrible food poisoning from the ravioli that kept her up all night. The vodka pappardelle and eggplant parm were good, but swimming in sauce. If you are considering Italian in SB, skip this place."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The food sucked and when asked ""how's everything,' I told the waiter what was wrong in politer terms than here.  The bread was stale, the tomato dip tasted like it was from a can.  The pasta was pasty and Bartoli fronzen like.  The chicken picata was too salty and lemony.  The calamari was pre frozen, over cooked beyond rubbery and was cardboarish.  It was not freshly prepared!  The mussels served numbered 7 for $15 and one was foul and two were dead and unopened.  Otherwise, compliments on the wine garlic tomato broth.  He did nothing about the complaint and was even a bit surly.  As happens with groups, some can't total their bils and separate checks were asked for, the waiter protested, did it, took forever, and then admonished us.   IIt'd been a longtime since the last time I was there, but the memory of mediocrity and expensive was still fresh, but my fellow diners said they loved the food and the ambiance of Christmas lights.   Skip a friend's suggestion of sentimentality or bad taste and avoid a whole in your wallet and food you can make better at home or enjoy elsewhere."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Chase was awesome! I've lived in SB for 4 years and can't believe I haven't been here until now. Gio was an amazing server and was accommodating as anyone could hope for. I was celebrating my 28th birthday and wouldn't have had it any other way.
Thank you, Chase... keep it up!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My first visit here was pretty good. We sat at the bar, had some wine and a few appetizers. Our second visit this weekend, not so much. We waited 20 minutes at 5 pm on a Saturday. It wasn't busy at all. It took almost ten minutes just to get water. I had to get up an leave at the 20 minute mark. No servers were even aware that we were leaving."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Absolutely fantastic service, Maggie was an excellent waitress. I had a party of nine and they let us split the check 9 ways which was very convenient. If you are a fan of calamari, I strongly suggest you get their calamari. The restaurant was small and had a very comfortable atmosphere where I felt welcome. I was able to talk to the owner Jack, and he was a very personable man who I suggest you strike up a conversation with."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Had friends come in from out of town and they asked where to get great Italian food at. I recommended Chase of course. After we placed our order, one of us ordering the lamb medium rare.  The food was brought out and the lamb was well well done where you could barely cut it with a knife. There was no excuse for the lamb to be over cooked to that extent considering my friend ordered medium rare as it was written by our waitress. We called the waitress over showed her the very well done lamb and she whisked it up to let the cook no. In the meantime our friend sat there without her meal until what she ordered in the first place was remade as she patiently waited while watching us all eat. She insisted so our food wouldn't get cold. 
  I was embarrassed because I recommended Chase to our friends who traveled 2 1/2 hours and there was no apology or a care in the world or can we offer her a slice of pie for her inconvenience, but yet was told by our waitress she called Jack the owner and he said no discount for them!!! Wow! It wasn't about looking for free food or a discount it was about the moral of the situation Chase restaurant and lounge. We have been loyal customers for a long time but after this, not any longer. I'm a true believer in making things right when things go wrong!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Food: DELICIOUS 10/10. Service/wait staff: 10/10 perfect, friendly, funny, professional. Manager: rude.  Midway through our meal, the manager came up and asked if he could move our table 6 inches in one direction to accommodate space to seat a large birthday party. My dining partner was in the restroom so I said that would be fine. The manager said ""I wanted to move you while your lady friend was in the restroom so it would not be too inconvenient."" I replied ""Well, okay, but I am not sure he would like to be referred to that way."" The manager replied ""Oh, it is a guy?"" and left.  Minutes later the manager returned carrying another table which he added to the end of the birthday party next to us to increase its capacity by 3 persons. This took up all of the additional space he had garnered by asking us to move our table. Now there was someone sitting literally 6 inches behind my dining partner. I appreciate it was outdoors, but tables should still be 6 FEET apart, not 6 INCHES. Our server was excellent very apologetic. The manager walked by and curtly said ""Is everything okay?"" I replied ""Not really; you asked if you could move our table so you could give additional space for the party at the next table, not so that you could add another table to theirs meaning they were only 6 inches away from us.""  He replied ""Oh, sorry.""  He could not have cared less, nor cared about our attempt to remain compliant with COVID dining recommendations.  We support local restaurants and hate to see shut-downs, but this was just a rude and ridiculous way to treat customers. So, great food, great service, terrible manager."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"First time at this restaurant. Made reservation a week in advance. Upon arrival, the hostess offered us the worst tables- a high boy choice or one on the sidewalk when there were plenty of other better tables available. Not a good start. We requested the outdoor patio and she seemed reluctant because the tables needed cleaning but agreed to let us sit there and had it cleaned. Food was disappointingly just mediocre - bland. nothing special. I can make better. Had the chicken marsala. Pros- reasonably priced food, big portions, quick service, and our server was great and attentive.  Cons: tasteless food, poorly trained hostess.  I realize its COVID and restaurants have had to adjust but this place has been open for quite awhile. There are better Italian restaurants in SB."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"If I could, I'd give this place a 10.   Our meal was fabulous.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was wonderful."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Ok ordered a Caesar salad, new york steak was bomb, ordered it with asparagus really good, all together meal was like 60 bucks an they had the audacity to double charge me for my sprite little crazy if you ask me, but thats one of my go to spot for a nice dinner"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The pasta was way over done and mushy, the piece of salmon was fat filled and way under cooked. The sauce was thrown on like a cheap buffet, but I should have known not to order food when the bread was stale and tasteless.

This is an Italian restaurant in name only!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Last time
Lived here all my life.  Counted on Chase to make mothers day dinner special. Ordered 1 day in advance. 45 min after scheduled delivery mom not eating and restaurants says ""super busy"". There are plenty of local places to support. Not going to Chase anymore."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This is my second bad review ever, but I needed to let people know. I'm a local and was looking forward to trying this place.  What a mistake! We ordered our food and an hour later I walked up to the manager and asked him why our food was taking so long. Instead of apologizing he said it was 45 min LOL! it took them 15 min to take out order, but I did not want to argue with him. Our food finally came out and it was horrible. Over slated to much sauce. This was bad Americanized Italian food. I would have had better tasting food at Olive Garden for quarter of the price.  The manger did not even come back to the table and ask how the food was or how we were doing.  We got our bill and he did not take care of anything. A Drink discount or ANYTHING would have been normal for a customer that was clearly not happy. This was the worst experience I have ever had in Santa Barbra. Don't wast your time."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,We had our work Holiday luncheon here. It was so yummy  the restaurant interior is quaint in a charming way and the wait staff was attentive. The portions were more than filling for a lunch menu. Classic Italian fare done well. Prices are reasonable. I most definitely will return.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Saw this menu outside and was going to try this Italian restaurant. Then I looked at the almost dead plant by the menu and thought they don't care much about how things look so maybe they don't care about other things. BTW there was another dead plant and an almost dead plant on the other side. Went up the street and found another Italian place.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Unless you are a regular, they are very aloof. I sat at the bar and had to beg for the bartender's attention. He was too busy serving and talking to his regular customers. 

The food is good, but I don't like being made to feel like I should feel privileged to be allowed to eat there."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a restaurant for dinner that had great food and a good vibe. A local recommended we try Chase. Unfortunately, Chase was the complete opposite of what we were looking for. Our server was neither friendly or attentive, the manager was busy chatting it up with some friends and playing on his phone the entire two hours we were at the restaurant. I ordered the shrimp piccata, and it was one of the worst meals I've ever had. The pasta tasted like plastic and the sauce had to have been from a can. I would not recommend this place for more than a quick drink at the bar."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Awesome food (I happen to love the chicken piccata here) and our new owner (Jack) in the pictures added some amazing desserts!  Love the Butter Pecan Cheesecake!!!  Jack's mother's original recipe...and it's Delish!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Diego
I left you 5 stars. I also left you a 3.00 tip for a 55.00 lunch. You forgot my ice tea. Never refilled water or my wifes ice tea. Would have left you 15.00 tip."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Genuinely friendly folks here, but the food was just average.  In fact, the calamari appetizer was disappointing.  Definitely geared for a more mature crowd."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Horrible service, messed up our order - weren't busy had 10 employees just standing around."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"It's been a while since I've dined at the Chase so my friend and I decided to stop by for an early dinner. We also wanted to check out the Christmas decor as it is pretty wild! It was beautiful inside with many twinkly lights and the Sinatra style music playing in the background definitely sets the mood. I ordered the chicken picatta and my friend had the shrimp picatta. We shared a bottle of the Chateau St. Jean Pinot Noir. It was delicious, we were stuffed and happy. The only reason I would not give 5 stars is because the food is a bit pricey. The price point is just a bit higher than I would normally see for this kind of menu but at least you won't leave hungry, the food in consistent, and our server Giovanni seemed very nice and attentive to our table."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I went late at night, inside was crowded and they were short in staff. I sat outside. Chicken piccata was good actually. And server did her best. However my request to sit next to a heater was turned down because they were all reserved, however nobody arrived and it was late evening. Overall, good food for reasonable price."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The food was good over all. The decor interesting, little lites and large picture of Bob Marley, Frank Sinatra and Elvis, interesting. Drinks are steep but well done. I agree the bread sucks. Cesar dressing was good the Piccata was good. The only real draw back was the waiter he really was not knowledgeable he had no idea what the well drinks were made with or much about the menu and was not particularly attentive. However the bus person was good and attentive.   Glad I went but probably would not go back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I am a huge fan of the Venetian fish chowder.  I get it every time I am in Santa Barbara.  My BF's go to (besides having a cup of the chowder) is the chicken piccata with fettuccine Alfredo.  The outside dining has been expanded and is great!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"They forgot items in our order and the rude manager said, what do you want me to do about it!!!!!! Horrible customer service and sub-par food."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,This place is delicious!! I had the Cobb salad with salmon and my sister had the chicken piccata. The staff was awesome! Very nice and all of them looked happy to be there.(rare these days) I will be back!!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Was a perfect night for a dinner outside. 
Started with basically fried Brussel Sprouts, which were delicious! 

My daughter had eggplant Parmesan. She said it was quite tasty. 

I subbed a wedge for my salad. It was really good and the raw onion slices were a nice touch. Chicken Picatta was everything I hoped it would be. Zesty, creamy, buttery. 
Great night out."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I live in downtown LA and visit Santa Barbara on the weekends a few times a month and every time my boyfriend and I go out to dinner, we eat at Chase. We always opt for a Bloody Mary/bloody Maria and the vegan lasagna!! We crave the lasagna because it is plate-scrapingly good, a boat of cheesy noddle and saucy goodness. The meat substitute is tasty and you wouldn't even be able to tell it's vegan meat. 10/10 would recommend!!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,This was such a great dining experience ! You can tell this establishment knows what they are doing!!! The manager is a true ninja making sure everything goes perfectly!  From reminiscing with my husband about his first bloody Mary at this restaurant  when he rolled into town in 2003z the experienced waitress was amazing!! We loved the food and dining experience
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This place is terrible.  If I could give negative stars I would... Service was rude and slow, food was mediocre, and the owner has no clue how to run a business.  I'd rather have 10 teeth pulled without anesthesia then go back here."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"First time coming to Chase. Went out for a date night with my girlfriend and we'd been eager to try this place.

First thing noted was the decor of the patio, tables were spaced well and the ambience of the exterior lighting brought a romantic feel to our dinner.

Rachel was great throughout, she recommended their Viognier to enjoy with our dinner and it paired well with their Chicken Parmigiana dish. If you can't make a simple Chicken Parmigiana, you shouldn't serve Italian food.

That's not the case here, glad we tried this gem in upper state street. Will definitely be back again to try their lunch specials!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went for the first time with a few friends. Literally sat for over an hour with NO service! Male server looked at us multiple times, even looked at our empty table, and did nothing. Even the busser told the server we needed service but still...nothing. Even tables that were sat after us were helped...even the ones RIGHT NEXT TO US. I have never walked out of a restaurant, but had to this at this point. Just communicate a bit better...thats all."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Most horrible restaurant ever!! My wife and I stopped by for lunch and a glass of beer last week Sunday (08/09). Food was not great but this is not the reason of my negative review. Our server lost my credit card. She was completely lost and upon my checking repeatedly where is my credit card, she gave vague responses. We waited for 40 minutes but they did not do anything and got busy serving other guests. My wife and I started searching for the card ourselves in the bar area, under the tables and even in their trash. Finally the manager or perhaps the owner showed up. He was worst than the staff. He blatantly said to me that we loose customers credit cards all the time and did not apologize. We raised concerns about their negligence and inconvenience caused to us while other customers who were watching this fiasco supported us. Instead of being remorseful he said to us never to return to the restaurant. He was such an arrogant and inconsiderate human being. We were completely blown away with rudeness of this restaurant staff and management. They say rightly, culture starts from the top. My suggestion to customers out there who are going to this restaurant will be, exercise extreme caution and make sure it does not happen to you what we went through there last Sunday."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My best friend and I thought this restuarant had great festive decorations for the holiday season and decided to dine there for dinner on our last night in santa barbara. The wait was extremely long, I don't think we were seated until an hour and a half after our arrival. While the food was quite delicious, shortly after dinner both me and my friend had food poisoning which resulted in a long miserable night over the toilet. Although we're not quite sure who's dish was at fault seeing as we both tried each other's dish, mine (the linguine with clams) and hers (chicken piccatta with spaghetti). So be warned!! You may get food poisoned if you go!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Nice & quiet place.  Service was good. Food was good but overpriced.  Probably wouldn't go back due to many other affordable restaurants in the area
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Fantastic service, delicious food! 

We had a bottle of the Justin 2017 wine and split the chicken picatta with the Alfredo fettuccini. 

The fettuccini was so rich and tasty. 
The chicken was so moist with an amazing flavorful sauce. Definitely would recommend and will eat here again."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Made a Yelp just to write them a review. 

I'm not sure how this place has a 3.5-4.5 review on different mediums. Not sure if locals in Santa Barbara just don't have a very diverse palette, or just have actual bad taste. 

Carbonara was a great food poisoning experience and primavera tasted like dish soap. 

When describing this to management, apparently it was just an opinion and their food is the ""best"" in town. 

Also, service was garbage. 

Funny joke as a restaurant. 

Nice mirrors though."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This place was HORRIBLE!  We were seated and told a server would be right with us... the the host preceded to sit down with the table next to us chatting it up while we waited...and waited...and waited! He finally saw we hadn't been served and went inside and we waited some more...he then came out and hung with his friends some more! A server came out and we ordered right then...
He got the drink order wrong, then they got the dinner order wrong and we waited again a long time for flat bread and a salad... the salad was brown edged and wilted...and wrong salad... we were at this point in a hurry to get to an event so we just ate it... but I did ask yo speak to the manager...he was a total ass! And had the nerve to correct me on how many things had gone wrong...the guy should be fired! He was sarcastic, condescending and unprofessional...
Don't bother going to this dive... there are some wonderful places in SB to eat! This was just a waste of time and money!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My partner and I made a reservation on a Friday night for 6:30pm. I had heard great things about the food and was  really looking forward to trying it. We arrived about 10 minutes early and the hostess promptly seated us. We noticed that there were several available tables and at least 3 waiters. However, no waiter came to our table for a 30-minute time period. One of the waiters saw us sitting there at about 15 minutes in, but she promptly turned her gaze elsewhere. We were being ignored. At the 30 minute mark, we got up and left. We could have let someone know that we hadn't been served at all (no drink or food order had been taken), but it was apparent that the staff knew we were there. Our experience was already soured because of that, so we ended up having a nice dinner elsewhere."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,came into chase on a saturday night at 5pm for some early dinner. i got the salmon provençal with asparagus and the brussels to start. the brussels sprouts were super super good and the salmon was insanely tasty. unfortunately the middle of the filet was quite raw so i had to send it back for a quick sear but other than that the experience was 5 stars. would definitely consider coming back here!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The outdoor dining area was nice and warm, but the food was overall very bad. The bread that came before we ordered was very standard/you can tell it wasn't made there, didn't come with oil or anything that you'd usually find at an Italian restaurant. First, the French onion soup came with a piece of cold bread with a piece of unmelted cheese on top - not usually how the dish is served. The vegetable side was basically steamed veggies with no seasoning and the chicken parm tasted like breaded chicken with pizza sauce on top. So overall great vibe and service but the food was very very sub par."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I always stop in when I travel from Santa Ynes Valley to shop State street. As a food server for many years (that helped train me to be a great nurse), I recognize when there is excellence in this area. I remember the same employee from the last time I came. He is exceptional, a gem, the friendliest and most solicitous to meet your needs. I wasn't his customer at the bar, yet he stepped in when I had questions about the menu that the bartender gave short answer for. He even offered a sample of the soup. He never stops! Constant moving and with a smile to every customer in the restaurant. He will be successful is wherever life takes him. This restaurant needs to recognize in a BIG way, Noah. I don't think I would be in such a rush to come back if not for the fun, and well taken care of experience I had. 
The red based snapper soup is excellent, the eggplant parm was a little too thinly sliced to notice the eggplant- but all is forgiven when one sees Noah's cheerful attitude (when one knows how tiring it can be). Management better offer something good to retain him. He knows how to run a successful establishment."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,We came in on my girlfriends birthday with no reservation. They got us in which was nice. Inside was small but had nice lighting. Outside was small as well but due to Covid they had expanded seating onto the sidewalk. We sat down for not long when someone sat on our table I assumed it was our server which it was. We ordered drinks which came fast then ordered our food which came 1 hour and a half later. The delay on the food and the delayed to no service is why I'm giving Chase a 1 star. The food was good but ordinary I got the chicken Marsala and my girlfriend the piccata both tasted the same as any other restaurant. Since they charge 30 dollars for each of these plates I'd assume they'd be better than average but they were not. I think maybe since they expanded their outdoor seating they're not able to have better service which is unfortunate.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,This is amongst the worst and most overpriced Italian restaurants I have ever eaten in.  Waiter was nasty and got most of the order wrong.  We ordered a chicken dish and asked for spaghetti instead of linguine and he changed the cream sauce to a horrible marinara sauce and when I told him he said that was what we ordered.  He would not take it off the Bill even though we never ate a bit.  The calamari was totally over cooked and dried out and be brought a different sauce from what he told me it was coming with.  He never came to the table after that until I asked management for the check.  Don't waste your time going to this horrible ridiculously overpriced restaurant.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Recommended by friends. Wife and I went for dinner. I had the fettuccine alfredo. It was awesome and fairly priced. Also, the service was very attentive. We enjoyed the setting and old school nature  of the place and would recommend it to others."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I've been to Chase many times and looked forward to taking my daughter for her first time. Rachel was our server who told us many things that I've NEVER heard from a server before. ""I worked here before Covid and now that I'm back lots of things have changed and I'm not up to date on them"". ""Since you are ordering a cocktail, I need to tell you that our bartender is in a very relaxed mood so it will take a while for you to get your drink"" (so I ordered a half bottle of wine instead). ""Oh wow, your soup looks like paella"". ""You can order your creme brulee to go, but I will scoop it out of the dish into a lump in the to go container"". And so on and so on. 
I will still go for the wonderful good and ambiance, but will request a different server if need be, or order it to go. It's a shame and very disappointing."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Fabulous location for an intimate dinner. No rush on the service but certainly appropriate attention. Delicious food with an Italian flair. The bartender knows the drinks well. Very good selection of wine. I had a great whiskey sour. Parking could bee a challenge on an early weeknight. Stop in on your next trip for a great relaxed evening.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"2.5-3 Overall

Price
It's Santa Barbara, so be prepared for it to be as pricey as just about every other restaurant in the city. I would definitely consider it pricey based on the quality of food. But, I will talk more about that.

Food
This along with the price is what dropped the score so significantly. When I go to restaurants I try to try a variety of menu items in order to see the range of the menu and this is quality a few chances. Unfortunately, the quality was not there. I ordered the fried raviolis, a flat bread, and a pasta dish. The fried ravioli was either previously frozen or just have a breading that was too thick and raviolis that were not hand made; which resulted in it being really dense. The flatbread, although assumingly handmade, had a really dense dough as well. Lastly, the pasta dish had overly cooked meat (chicken) with more thick breading and bought in bulk pasta that was, as you can guess dance, and a cream sauce that tasted purely like cream. Water was good (which is important) and just like many other places in Santa Barbara they don't do warm bread.

Location
Great, location on lower State Street. The atmosphere at the restaurant is nice and the music isn't too loud. It would be great for a date night.

Service
Although, they were down a server the people on were super friendly. 

Overall, 2.5-3
the service I received and the location and ambience of the restaurant is what saves this from being a place you should just avoid. With that said the food and price needs significant work. Either the quality of the food needs to go up in order to match the price or the price needs to go down to match the quality of food."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I was really excited to try this place but waitress was rude and my food took over 90 minutes to get to my table and I was cold. When I tried to talk to the manager he was too ""busy"" never coming again clam chowder was fire though too bad the service was so bad"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Overall, this is not a bad restaurant. I am writing this review during the time of the coronavirus COVID-19 so all dining is alfresco. 

The  outdoor dining space of this restaurant is nicely designed; it has umbrellas to keep the sun off most but not all of the tables. So, I would suggest that you come at a time when you can have a choice of tables because there are a few tables where you'll be forced to eat your meal out in the sun. This is, of course, in reference to daytime dining. At night, you would be fine.

In terms of food, they serve a broad range of Americana. Overall, the food is well prepared, but it's one of those restaurants where the menu presents nothing exceptional. Certainly not bad, but not noteworthy. 

A few things to mention.... First of all, as a fan of coffee, the coffee here is not very good. At five dollars per cup, one would expect something at little bit better. It is very strong, bitter, and it is lukewarm at best. This appraisal is not based upon one single cup of coffee but on the various cups of coffee I've had here. They really should step up their game when it  comes to their coffee.

The other thing which I feel I should comment on is the fact that they are not always fully stocked with what is on their menu. For example, on my most recent visit, I ordered a dark beer. Something, that the waiter guaranteed that they had. A short time later, he came back and said they we're out of dark beer. It's not really a big issue, but I believe if they say they have something they should have it in stock.

All of the staff here is very nice though not all efficient. For example, on my most recent visit the server asked if we wanted more coffee, which we did, he did not return with the pot for fifteen minutes even though there were several other staff members handling the other tables. 

Overall, the high points of this restaurant are that you get to sit on a nice patio on State Street. The atmosphere is nice and the food is pretty good."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This place has a beautiful setting, good menu selection & ambience which tempted me to book this place for our thanksgiving dinner in Santa Barbara. We reserved the restaurant in advance but when we arrived we were told that half of the menu items weren't available to order!!! How do you take reservations & not have food to serve?! It was a 8pm reservation on Thanksgiving & we couldn't go anywhere else since most restaurants were closed or booked. Ended up eating there only. Couldn't pick anything that we liked. Ended up ordering what was available only. I asked the server in the beginning if I should order the Apple pie with the dinner as well in case they run out but she said it would be ok but guess what! when we finished our dinner that was gone too!! Pretty disappointing experience on our vacation. 
We were seated outdoors & told they don't have heaters for our table. Mind you this was a cold night & reservation was made for outside. 
Only positive thing was our server. She was warm, friendly & very quick. She kept saying, ""thank you for putting up with us"". Hope they do better job on their inventory & service!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"After walking up and  down State Street and doing some shopping we decided to stop for dinner at Chase. The outdoor sitting was very enticing as well as the menu. Top service from our server Diego. He was very polite and patient with us. He gave us great suggestions and kept checking on us. We could not use the check in coupon but maybe next time...
Great dinner option if you are visiting beautiful Santa Barbara."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"It pains me to say this about an old favorite, but the food ordered tonight was nothing like how it used to be. Flatbreads were hard as rocks and the Brussel sprouts (my fav) were so over cooked there were only crisped leaves left. Puttanesca extremely salty."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Service was absolutely terrible. Food was ok, after waiting what seemed like hours for it."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We had homemade Ravioli, piccata and cranberry lemonade. We loved everything. Staff was very nice as well."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The inside looks so beautiful and I love the lights. Great customer service and that's about it. The food that was ordered was to-go and I even read the reviews before deciding to eat here.  We came from SF to go shopping in Santa Barbara and decided to grab dinner before returning to our hotel. My mom was craving seafood and so we ordered: Shrimp, calamari, fish chowder and fettuccine Alfredo. 

Milanese ""Ma's Way"" Calamari- a BLOCK of heavily breaded calamari and no lemon wedges. Had a bite and I just could not continue. NO.

Provincial Shrimp- 3 pieces breaded shrimp which was very salty. I was disappointed because I expected a garlic flavor and was overcompensated with salt. 

Fish Chowder- mom said it was bland and I was too upset to even try to be honest. 

Bread and butter- soft and yummy.

With tip it was around $60 and yes I regret it, so I do not recommend this place and sadly will not return."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Great location but the people are what makes this place awesome. All are friendly very attentive, welcoming and that is very important and something I miss in NYC. Thank you and you all rock."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"It's been a week since I had their chicken picatta with fettuccine & pink sauce and I can still taste it in my mouth! I can honestly say this dish ranks top 3 of the best dishes of my life! I don't live in the area and already know I won't be back in Santa Barbara anytime soon so I've been scouring Pinterest to try and replicate this dish. The blend of the lemon caper sauce with pink sauce was so unexpected and incredibly delicious.
Highly recommend paying a visit if you're in the area- the food is AMAZING...ambience is AMAZING..service is AMAZING!! I can keep going but I gotta return to my Pinterest search! Thanks for a great experience CHASE!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Great established restaurant downtown Santa Barbara. Wonderful people watching if you sit on sidewalk area out front. Italian cuisine and food good, disappointed last time as they were out of mussels; tried steamed clams and they had a kind of off herbal flavor to sauce. Pasta is probably best choice here. But word of warning, as far as Happy Hour. Chase changes their schedule at different times without warning; they had just had a sign out advertising extending happy hour 3 to 7 Monday through Friday, last evening stopped in and was told ""Oh no Happy Hour in December . Last year when stopped in on Friday Christmas parade day was told Oh we don't have Happy Hour on Holidays, huh? A parade is a holiday? I guess this year they decided all of December is a holiday."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"When I am craving Chicken Picatta, I always go to Chase. What could be better than Picatta and alfredo? Decedent for sure but every once in a while you have to splurge. Comes with a basket of bread and wither soup or salad so sometimes the hubs and I share. 

I had not been in a long time, as I went gluten free last year, but I saw on the menu that they had a GF pasta alternative. Yay!! Awsome to have the Alfredo and my picatta with no wheat. Very close to the original and left me satisfied. I'll be back!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We visited Chase on Halloween evening.   We were welcomed by a  warm inviting atmosphere with  actually..... live music.   our server was dressed like Tigger and was so attentive to us.  We shared the Rib eye which was a bit under cooked and Tigger returned it to the kitchen and brought it back soooo perfect.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere so inviting.  With covid present and the election pending... we slipped away from life's big worries.  We will definitely return.  

Our reservation was under the name Becks"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I usually only write reviews if they are 4-5 stars. I would've given this place 5 stars because I enjoy the food. However I am a bit disappointed. I called ahead specifically asking if they take the axxess deal and the man I spoke to said yes- in which I said great! And proceeded to order. The man seemed very confused on the phone with my order and I had to repeat it 3 times (I just ordered a fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parm)  and then he put me on hold for awhile- which isn't a big deal. However when my boyfriend when to pick up our food they denied his axxess deal and said they don't use it during the pandemic- which is fine but then don't say on the phone you will accept it. Pretty irritated as one employee told us they accept it and the other rejected it. I understand restaurants are struggling but so are many humans and being able to have a coupon on food would have been nice during these times. If they don't accept it then they should have told me right away as that was my first question. I should've gotten the mans name on the phone. Oh well, still a yummy Italian place just disappointed in that interaction."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went to celebrate the holidays and a friends birthday. I was served two separate cocktails both with lipstick on the glass that was not mine. This is sad as I only ordered two throughout the entireity of the evening. Service was entirely too slow even for  a busy night and after a 45 minute wait for appetizers our order was wrong. I cannot believe how bad the Chase has become. Never have I been treated so poorly in a Santa Barbara Restaurant. I actually witnessed the bartender slam a menu shut in a woman's face then throw her out for complaining about her soiled dishes and incorrect order.

Chase Bar and Grill used to be an amazing family owned restaurant where you were treated well, the food was amazing, and the drinks were always good. Never once was I served anything in a soiled dish. Customer service here was  once impeccable. Now it is nothing more than a shame.

I most certainly wish the Caligiuri family still owned the  Chase as I know they would NEVER let this happen.

To sum up my 2011 visit to what used to be the best restaurant in SB in two words I would have to say HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"It's burger week in Santa Barbara where participating restaurants offer a $7 burger.  We attempted to get one here last night but after we were seated were told they stopped serving it at 4. We tried again  today and after waiting for 15 minutes to be even offered menus we were told they had sold out of the burgers. This was at 1:45. 
obvious BS."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I took a shot at eating here, despite its heavy, traditional Italian food, because I appreciated that they were participating in the Vegan Chef Challenge. I wish they hadn't.  Their vegan lasagne was nearly inedible and the salad appetizer was cafeteria quality. 
  I applaud the effort at plant based cuisine.  But quality counts too."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Lunch appetizer menu and service are excellent. 
Calamari is the real deal. Bread, butter and tasty Parmesan served before the appetizer. I was attended to like a queen. Sat on the front patio near the bar on a beautiful day. Stop and enjoy your day here."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Horrible service. They are racist do no attend people . Was left at table unattended for more than 20 minutes. Do not come here if you are Mexican they will not serve you. They don't know I'm college educated could have left $100 tip worst service in Santa Barbara va fangulo a la concha the tu madre.horrible service
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,First time here.  Was looking forward to trying and other than the great customer service we received I was not overly impressed.  Some friends split a pasta and thought it was odd that they charge $7 for an extra plate for the split.  Probably won't be back for food but could see myself grabbing a beer and sitting outside on a nice day
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Honestly, my friend chose this restaurant for us to go to. Wasn't a first pick on my end, and I think I had a good sixth sense.

This restaurant is quite overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food we received. The bread seemed like it was just sliced bread from Vons/Albertsons, and the food was pretty mediocre overall. My friend got a Caesar salad without protein and it was almost $17 after tip! That's kinda crazy. 

Service was kinda slow too, even though it wasn't busy whatsoever. Bonus points to our waiter for giving us a pitcher of coke because I asked for refills though :)"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Decided to treat myself to a nice dinner and had seen their restaurant week menu items which sounded delicious. They closed at nine thirty so I jumped in my car, drove downtown, walked in the rain, get through the doors at 820... And they tell me they closed early. I informed them that online it says they close at nine thirty and there's still over an hour, and they informed me that sometimes they close the kitchen early. No other explanation was provided, just an empty ""yeah, sorry.""

So I'm left with a grumbling stomach, disappointed heart, and confused mind wondering why this business doesn't follow it's own business hours."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This is the worst restaurant on State Street in Santa Barbara. I truly don't know how this restaurant survives. My wife and I went here two months ago. I ordered ravioli and I can't remember what my wife ordered. However, the food was SALTY and I personally love salt. At first my wife said she could bear it and I asked if she was sure. After eating half of her dish, I didn't know what to do but I told the server anyway. The server was dumb as rocks. She asked me, ""So you don't want a box?"" I just complained that the food was salty. Seriously?! Then I told her ""No, I just want to pay."" She brings the check and asks ""Would you like dessert?"" Wow. I couldn't even believe she asked me another dumb question. I made my wife upset because I didn't make a big enough fuss and still gave the server a 10% tip. My night was ruined thanks to this travesty of a restaurant."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I wanted to give this place every benefit of the doubt because of everything going on in our world right now but it was just such a horrible experience for me and my pregnant fiancée to ignore. First off, we had made a reservation for 8:30 and were not seated till around 9:00, which is understandable because the place was busy but still. When we did finally get seated it took ANOTHER 30 minutes for the server to even attend us, she even attended people sitting right next to us who had been seated after us first. It got to the point where one of the bussers had to come and ask us if we had been attended yet, and when the answer was no he even looked surprised and went to go tell someone. Long story short, we were sat at 9:00 and we didn't get any food until 10:00, an hour after we had been seated!!! I don't know what it was but it just seemed like they did not care that we were there, I really felt like we weren't welcome there and we were being discriminated against because of our appearance. I don't want to pull that card but that's just how it made us feel. If I could leave 0 stars I would, the food wasn't even that good. Shoutout to the bussers for caring more than the servers and management."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I see recently they received favorable reviews and I will note what positive experience I had before commenting on unfavorable dining experience.
We sat outside, plenty of tables and chairs for alfresco dining. We were greeted after sometime, and Edgar took our order. My husband ordered sandwich and soup/salad, I ordered Mahi Mahi with grilled vegetables. I also ordered a glass of rose.
Our meal arrived after awhile, and I noticed my glass had a piece of cork floating in it. I mentioned it to Edgar, but he did not offer a replacement. Not a problem, I'll have another glass. Eating my meal, there were plenty of vegetables a variety of carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. Unfortunately they may have been previously frozen because they were lightly cooked/lukewarm on the outside and cold on the inside. 
Half the vegetables were cooked this way, so I mentioned this to Edgar. Unfortunately, the manager was not available to adjust the bill. We paid the full amount, and were leaving not really happy with the meal. I walked into the restaurant and found the manager to express displeasure with my meal. Begrudgingly he asked how I wanted it handled, and I stated to please adjust my bill. He refunded me $2.00
First and last visit to Chase Bar & Grill :("
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Birthday dinner for our friend and food wasn't correct. Food was really bad. The tomohawk chop was about inch and half thick!!! Service was not good! He wasn't familiar with menu. They didn't have any bottled water sparkling or still and out of every drink I asked for. I got 21 years in business and was completely let down at every point of meal. Do not recommend this place. I could understand if service was bad and food was good or service was good and food sucked but they both were terrible. Waste of money
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Awful. Service is terrible. Food is 1970s breaded gross. Not a dining experience as the menu is stale at Fazoli's
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,My whole family and I love coming to Chase for special occasions. It's a cute/ romantic place to have a nice dinner. Food is amazing and waiters are friendly and attentive. Best Italian I've found in town. I always get the chicken Alfredo and the sauce is so flavorful and the chicken is moist. Highly recommend!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Really enjoyed dinner here with my boyfriend, it has a very nice decorations inside that makes it feel homey but also very comfortable. The food was amazing & portion sizes are definitely worth the money! Definitely the best pasta in town. Would recommend for dinner dates & any time you are craving a bowl of pasta!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Jack and Franky thank you so much for the wonderful service, you guys were outstanding. Excellent food, the Cioppino was delicious. We will  definitely be coming back for more. Again thank you, you guys made our weekend."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"another friend and I came up to Santa Barbara for my birthday and we split the salmon and arugula salad it was just enough for a late lunch and Noah was our waiter, he did an excellent job and made our experience truly enjoyable. thank you Chas for another great meal."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I don't know why all the reviews are so bad! I definitely think you should give this place a shot! The vegan items on the written board PULLED us in! Surely, we were not disappointed! We both ordered the vegan chicken parm & a side of fettuccine. My fiancé said it was the best vegan chicken parm he's ever had! It's not usual to find CRISPY vegan chicken parm, but they did it! Moreover, the marinara sauce was perfect. Not salty & was delicious! The fettuccine on the side was also cooked nicely as well & the sauce on it was creamy & amazing! Even the patio decorated for the holidays made for a welcoming ambiance. The servers were attentive as well. I thoroughly enjoyed our meal here!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"The food was so amazing. Everything tasted healthy. Our waitress Rachel was amazing she treated us so friendly and nice. Food came out in a timely manner even with the restaurant being so busy! The cooks coming in clutch with the A1 food. Next time I visit Santa Barbara I'm definitely stopping by Chase. Fire food, amazing people. Thank you Chase Restaurant!! 100/10 recommend!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The worst food I've ever had was at this restaurant. First we had to wait 20 minutes to even order then 1 hour to receive our food. We are out of towner's and the service was terrible. We carefully read the menu to make sure we knew what we were ordering. My mom ordered pasta primavera & it came to the table looking like someone dumped Alfredo on it. My mom who has brain damage from heart attacks thought she was nuts because she'd never seen this dish served this way. She could eat 1 bite. My daughter ordered chicken Caesar salad & spaghetti. The slag was super spicy and she ate 2 bites. The chicken on the salad was so rubbery and undercooked you couldn't tear it with your teeth. We fed it to our dogs who ate 3 pieces then stopped. When we got home they threw it up. I got a burger that said it had bbq sauce, onion shreds & cheese. I asked if it came with anything else & he said lettuce & tomato. I said I don't want that just the meat, bun, cheese bbq sauce and onion shreds. I got it with Mayo, onion rings & rings of raw onions. I immediately complained & said it wasn't made according the menu. He said I'll fix it but it may take a while cuz we weren't the only ones there. I tried to eat it. My family tried to eat it as we'd been on the road since 6 am and it was 2 & we were starving. I told the waiter I'm not paying for this as no one ate anything. He argued so I asked to speak to the manager. I waited for 10 minutes and if my kid & mom weren't there I would hv walked without paying which I've never done in my life. Finally I went up to the counter and asked where the manager to which another server said he wasn't there today. So there was never going to be a manager & he said too bad . They handed me a $96 bill which I begrudgingly paid $63 with no tip which I've never done either. Waste of money, rude server & cook who doesn't know his own menu. Yuck!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We have come here often for happy hour and have generally been very happy. The $5 calamari is my favorite in town, on top of that, the drinks are good and reasonably priced. While it's normally happy hour every day, we went this past weekend and just assumed it was business as usual. Ordered two drinks and the calamari and were surprised at the end to find that there was no happy hour due to Memorial Day Weekend. While I understand, I kind of expected at least a heads up. We paid happily because the waiter was nice but it was just quite the surprise."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Chase's food is super consistent, always excellent, and some of the best around. They always get my special orders right and are nice and accommodating."

-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Amazing food and service. Visiting Santa Barbara for the weekend and stopped in for dinner on Saturday night with no reservation. We waited about 20 minutes, but got to meet Braden, the bartender. He recommended a bottle of wine that was amazing. We were concerned that it would be an expensive bottle, but no! One of the lowest on the wine list, it was just his favorite Pinot Noir. And we agreed. He was genuine and very friendly, not just trying to upsell.

When we were seated, the staff were so friendly and the food was to die for. Strongly consider getting the Ceasar salad Mediterranean style. And if you like anchovies, they've got them. The homemade made pasta melted in the mouth, al dente but so fresh! The sauces added so much flavor. The Green lipped muscles in the Cioppiono were a surprise! High quality food! If we lived here, we would return again and again!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I have been coming to Chase Grill for over 20 years. That said, I have so much sentiment attached to this place.
Chase is a hit or miss. I've had great service, poor service; amazing food and bad, that's just how it works. But when I want comfort food in Santa Barbara - I go to Chase.
Their weekly lunch specials are amazing! I highly recommend the salmon with the orange sauce and alfredo. Dinner tends to get busy so get there early. The cocktails depend on the time of day: in the afternoon they're normally made by the waitress/waiter which can be frustrating instead of a full-time bartender. Overall the food is always decent and there's always Frank Sinatra playing.
I know people can be thrown off by the decor, but it's just Chase. It's an icon for that reason. Sure they could use a few upgrades, but I keep coming back because I know what I'll get; a belly full of warm comfort food, some jazz in the background, and wonderful memories."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Thoroughly disappointed with this restaurant. Passed by & thought it looked good due to the beautiful decorations and menu but do not be deceived!! Came for my 23rd birthday, waited 45 minutes only for my ""medium rare"" steak to come out well done. (Among with the two chicken piccata's coming out TERRIBLE). Sent it all back & my medium rare steak came out definitely RARE. Our special meal could have been better but could not have been worse. Do not recommend. Our waiter and the manager could not have care less about our terrible experience. Please don't waste your time"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"First time  at this location... the bartender, Megan met us at the door. She made us feel so comfortable and happy and brought us cskw to celebrate our anniversary. I have honestly never met a bartender that was so kind. We will be back!!! Thank you Megan. You have such a beautiful soul."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Reservation was at 8:30, they sat us down 9:30.
The food took forever to come. Then the food came wrong.  The stake was taste less and under cook,  the pasta was very over cooked and the sauce was excessive. Not what we expected at all."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Sub par. Ordered the chicken Marsala and it was tasteless, chicken was rubbery and the Whisky Sour smelled of egg and was too sweet. Service was slow. The rest of my party wasn't at all excited with the food. Everything was kind of meh. Won't be coming back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We booked the restaurant 3 days before as we were a party of 11 people with 4 kids. Just 1/2 hour before the reservation time, they called so say, they are over booked and can't serve us. After lot of request they adjusted us in 2 tables. We requested so much as no restaurant would take a party of 11 on Saturday night.
After sitting on the table it took them 30 mins to send the server and to serve it took for ever. Horrible service provided. Even for our drinks it took them 30 mins to give. Would never recommend this place ever."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"We had dinner at Chase last evening. The owners Jack and Jamie were there and checked on us personally many times. Our meals were slow to arrive, so he treated us to his wife's home made pecan cheesecake which was delicious! He wanted to make sure we left happy and we did."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This dining experience was actually traumatizing. Racist workers and establishment. 

We waited hours for our food and never had anyone come to check on us. We ended up receiving several wrong items, and received the wine we ordered 1 1/2 hour after we sat down. We were spoken to with extreme condescending attitudes and eye rolls. We had a steak knife dropped on us, and when inquiring about our replacement order for a wrong item, we were told ""the kitchen is not going to be making it"". All without a single apology or sign of sympathy. 

We asked to speak to a manager, which of course took another half an hour to actually occur. We stated our grievances and wanted our replacement order to be properly addressed. Instead, we were GASLIT. An employee (I believe the bartender) marched to our table and got in our face, accusing us of name calling, when we said thank you to every wait staff  that ever helped us. He accused us of harassing his staff, and said that we were being rude. The manager had to pull him back and get him away from our table when we were in disbelief of what we were being accused of. The manager tried his best to resolve the situation, and the nicest representative of the restaurant but sided with the staff and didn't seek to offer a comprehensive solution. He tried to place the blame on new or emotionally unstable employees, which didn't really make us feel any better, just more scared than anything. Bartender might need anger management courses, saw a couple of other reviews stating how he tried to fight various patrons.

-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I went out to dinner at the Chase with a gal friend Wednesday evening. As usual I had the lasagna and she had the Chicken Picatta. Both are amazing. We had the best service . The waiter was nice enough to pack up some soup for us to give to a homeless man. It's always a great experience there. I went back the next day by myself and once again had the best service. Thank you Always
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I'm not even sure where to start. Easily the worst night out I've ever experienced! 
Made a reservation for 16 for a birthday celebration at 4:30 on a Sunday. When we arrived there was room for 10. After 30 minutes we were able to shove in 13 of us. I've never been so glad about 3 people not showing up! From this point on nothing went right. I will just make a list so this review isn't 3 pages long:
Ordered 4 pizzas for the kids. The server came back out and said they ran out of pizza. (I thought it was a joke!)
Half the food came out, then 40 minutes later the rest came. The kids were done eating before we got our food so they were restless when we finally got to eat. 
4 of the food orders came out wrong...Never got fixed. 
Never got bread after asking for it multiple times
Never refilled water
Had to ask 3 times for another bottle of wine
One order was so overcooked it was inedible
Waitress bragged about being high
Got charged for 2 extra vegetables that were never ordered
Never got child meal desserts
Kids drinks were never refilled
We were so fed up with everything that we paid our bill (extra charges and all) and left as fast as we could. We spent hundreds of dollars on the worst experience at a restaurant we've ever had. 
We've eaten at Chase many times in the past. Unfortunately this is the last time anyone from this group will ever dine here."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I have to state I did not eat here and thankfully just by walking into this place I reassured myself I would never eat here. It smelled old and dirty inside. The corners, bars and lights were caked with dust and dirt from years of neglect. I only walked in to try and get a night cap drink. I baffled the bartender when I asked what type of Amaro's they had. He had no clue what I was asking for. I looked for myself and to my surprise I did not even see the basics like Aperol or Campari. What type of so called ""Italian"" restaurant doesn't even have Campari? After reading some of the other reviews and seeing how loud that they have to play music  outside in order to pull people in I have come to the conclusion that this is 10000% FAKE ITALIAN food place. Only meant for tourists who don't know any better."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This was one of the few open places on Thanksgiving and I regretted not checking Yelp for reviews.

The bread was dry and cold, the ice tea was blurred meaning that it was probably waited overnight a day or two.  The entree was nothing special and tasted like instant meal.  Very friendly staff and nice ambience but probably could be a better place for drinks only. Very disappointed with the food."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This spot saved us during a shopping spree on a hot day in Santa Barbara! The pulled pork sandwich and California cobb salad was the perfect meal to share.  My daughters loved the spinach ravioli and chicken tenders. Diego, the server, was prompt and friendly.  Great restaurant on State Street!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"A wonderful dining experience. Our waiter, Noah, was great as well as the rest of the staff. Perfect Italian food. We took Noah's suggestion and had the pecan cheesecake.  The owner's wife makes it fresh daily. It was to die for!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,I did not like the attitude the server was giving us... she would not accomadate 15 of us in a table to sit all together.. she was arguing that she could not loose any chairs just to accomadate us.. instead of explaining it nicely she was rude... we asked for more bread and it took 5 minutes for them to bring back more bread... The food was good but nothing over the top
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Hopefully you are very hungry when you come to Chase, because they pack a lot into the dinners they serve!

Came for an early dinner on Saturday before a show I was going to see, and hopped up to the bar and set myself up.  Nice Bartender, personable, been there for over 30 years and a staple to the Santa Barbara Area.

The waitresses were nice too, chatted them up for a bit as well, and then got into ordering dinner.

I got the Chicken Parm Entree as a go too choice, and the good part about it is that it comes with Bread Basket, House Salad, and side of Spagetti Marinara or Fettucini Alfredo. So be prepared to eat!!

The food overall was just O.K, nothing to blow your hair back or impress you. Lacked in flavor a bit, but was super filling.  So again, make sure you are hungry or else you are leaving with Takeaway.

Bottom line for the spot, is that sadly it falls just below 4 stars. Hits 3 stars because the price is a little steep, and there are many many other choices in town.

But if you are a local, and you want to feel like family and come here all the time. This is your spot. Tourists could try elsewhere"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I've been to this restaurant three times. The service staff is very nice, wear masks and are attentive. Today I had to walk away before even ordering. The owner of the restaurant does not wear a mask. It's not the first time I've seen this. Today I was standing outside the restaurant for ten minutes deciding what to order and watching the owner right up against his staff ordering them to do something and he had no mask on. He looked right at me and didn't even try to put a mask on so I could approach to place an order. No respect for his employees or his customers in the middle of a raging pandemic. And his practices should be cited by the health department. It makes me wonder what other health precautions are not being taken if the owner can't even set the right example in public."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"VEGAN REVIEW:

I hate giving a bad review, especially during this time when I feel like restaurants need some business and good PR, but I just can't give a good review to Chase. 

They had vegan options which is a plus, but what I ordered was not great. I had the vegan stuffed bell pepper which was supposed to come with a side of garlic mashed potatoes, and a soup or salad. 

The salad was basic. Ask for no cheese. The balsamic is the only vegan dressing. Not expecting much. It was fine!

The stuffed pepper was ok. Lots of tomato sauce, rice, and meat substitute. It tasted fine but there was just so much tomato sauce that it tasted like tomato sauce. I think it was premade and reheated. 

The side of garlic mashed potatoes never came. Instead, I got a side of spaghetti with tomato sauce. When my plate came, I asked about the mashed potatoes and the waitress said she would bring it. When she returned, she said they ran out which is why I got the spaghetti. I wish they said something before bringing the dish out or discounted the plate because I don't like eating spaghetti like that. 

The service was also subpar. It took a long time to order and we had to ask to get a bread basket that literally every single table had. The table next to ours even complained to the waitress about the wait times! 

My friend, who is not vegan, got the chicken piccata and hated it. She also got a ton of pasta and two small chicken pieces. They also charged her $2 extra for getting Caesar dressing with her side salad. So bizarre. 

A plus: they had outdoor seating which was nice."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Chase is a Santa Barbara staple. Solid steaks, great chicken piccata, (ask for the side of pasta with vodka sauce), great drinks, delicious Caesar salad, and great apps, great happy hour great ambiance. Enjoy!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"#fatjared say...this will be the shortest review I have ever written, because it's the shortest time I have ever been at a restaurant. 0 good things to say about it. I would give 0 stars, but Yelp won't let me.

For my reviews, to get a 1 star, you have to have don absolutely nothing right. Well Chase, good job, nothing.

I have photos to prove what happened and made us want to leave. We sat down, were not greeted for a while, then someone brought bread. It was dry and nasty, then my wife told me there was mold on her piece. Low and behold, she was right. We got up, took the bread to the people, and simply said, we're gonna go somewhere else. 

The hostesses didn't ask why, didn't try to get us to stay, just said ok, and we walked out. Go somewhere else. They don't care about the food, or about the people obviously."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Over the last few weeks, this has been a regular stop for me.  I love sitting at the bar and soaking in the atmosphere.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, the food is delicious ( sometimes a tad salty though).  That was all I was going to say, but I was reading the reviews and noticed one in particular and felt i should stand up for staff that, as I have witnessed, always bend backwards for the customers...About, The dog woman who left a bad review.  Funny to me, cuz I was sitting at the bar when it happened.  The dog woman was set on being unhappy, did not want to sit on the patio (she had a dog), and whined the entire short time she was there.  The host graciously set up and rearranged chairs for her went to get menus for her, and seconds later dog lady was screeching and hollering on her way out.  Dog lady even stopped outside the door to continue her craziness, shouting something about people liers (even while her friends scurried to get away from her).  Just wanted to offset dog lady's irrationality with some truth.  Try the Chase, I love it!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"this is a must visit place. I moved to Florida 3 years ago, but conitue to recomend and frequent this place as much as possible. While the food is outstanding, you can always tell how good a restaurant is in a tourist town, by how many locals hang out here. The place is always busy, but gets food and drinks to the customers quick!

A special thanks to George the owner, and Megan our waitress for their great service the other day. called and they were able to accomodate a table of 6 with only an hour notice. 

Cant say enough great things about it. been here over 30 times, and never had a poor experinece."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Ssooooo slow. Waited 20 min for the server to even come over to us. Forgot our drinks. Then was offered my check before i even got any of my food.. and we never even got everything we ordered. When i did get my food there was a hard layer on top from sitting in the window. Also they were out of fettuccine noodles ?? at an Italian restaurant ???
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Stopped by while others were shopping.  It was a little chilly so chose an Irish Coffee.  Delicious!!!   They put in a hint of baileys and a dark cherry with a drizzle of cherry juice.  Perfect.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"They have a racist and rude bartender working here. I was here over the weekend on the 17th with my boyfriend for an after dinner drink. As soon as we sat down at the bar, the bartender (not sure what his name was, he had a shaved head) came over and as soon as my bf (a hispanic man) started to say ""I would like..."" the bartender goes ""did you just say I am a scumbag?"" Shocked and weirded out, we were like umm, and then he REPEATS himself. And once again says ""oh I though you just said I am a scumbag."" At that point he walked away and another bartender (don't know name, had glasses) comes over and takes our drink order and made our drinks. The name on my receipt says Tyler. I don't know if that is the bartender with glasses or the shaved head. This was completely unacceptable and gross behavior, I am still shocked and stunned that this encounter even happened, for him to call my boyfriend a scumbag for absolutely no reason other than us walking in and sitting down at the bar."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,This was absolutely the WORST Italian food I have ever had! Server was attentive but the food was god awful. I only hope I don't get food poisoning tonight. Cannot believe this place is in business!! Do yourself a favor and  avoid this place.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Came here for Restaurant Week tonight.  Delicious Chicken Parmesan and my wife had great Chicken Picata.  The pastas were wonderful.  Salad with Balsamic was excellent.  Cheesecake good.  Decaf was hot and really good.  Good Gin and Tonics.  We will be back.  It was our first time tonight.  By the way, the ambiance was wonderful."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I took my girlfriend to this restaurant for her birthday dinner this past week. I understand workers are doing their best to keep business flowing during these times, but our waitress seemed like she wanted to rush us out of our seats. Not sure if this was because she wanted more tables/tips or because we look like a young couple. Later in the evening, my meal was missing an add-on, and I accidentally addressed the wrong waitress, but immediately realized my mistake and apologized. This second waitress reacted to the situation very awkwardly, not really using her words, and making me feel uncomfortable/embarrassed. As a person who has worked at a 5 star restaurant, I know mistakes like these happen a lot and you should always address the customer with grace and a willingness to help, not make them feel bad for their mistake. Overall, the food was slightly above average. However the most uncomfortable part of the evening was when my girlfriend and I got up to leave after paying, and the waitress looked at her tip as she was giving a parting greeting. Probably will not dine here again, but might have been a one time experience. These waitresses obviously had no bad intentions, but should be more aware of their demeanors."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I noticed that this place wasn't rated very well. I must say, they were fantastic last Saturday night and celebrating my husband's birthday. They were professional, positive and were very helpful. We started there earlier in the day for a cocktail, which was very refreshing. We sat on the patio relaxing and decided to hit the same place again later that evening for dinner. The interior reminded me of New York and San Fran  eateries, it had class and a quaint feeling to the place. I ordered the Caprese Salad and some chicken and both were great. I wouldn't say this place was the best Italian. I mean, I'm from Europe, it's hard to find fantastic Italian outside of NYC and Europe. I found the customer service and the decor made the evening and the food was a pleasant bonus. I would go back and the Birthday cake at the end of the evening was a nice treat for the hubby. Thanks again Chase!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Had high hopes for this restaurant as it had a nice ambience, even with all the tables being put outside due to covid restrictions. We arrived for our 5:30 reservation (party of 4) and were seated immediately by a kind hostess. The restaurant was about half full by this point. We then waited for 30 minutes before a staff member brought by water and bread (which was cold - unsure if it should have been warm, but I love bread all ways so it was fine for me, but not our entire party). At the same time, a large party of 7 or so was sat at the table next to us and within a few minutes were greeted by a waitress to put in their drink orders. 

At this point, my boyfriend went over to the hostess to let them know that no one had come to our table. About five minutes after that a server came to our table at which point we said we were ready to put in everything. He told us to go ahead so we ordered a margarita, beer, Pelegrino, and whiskey sour. We then ordered the mussels and one entree in, the server told us to wait on our food orders while he put the drinks and mussels in first. Thinking this meant he was going to put in our drinks and come straight back to take our food orders (which we said we were ready to order), we agreed. 15 minutes later, he did not come back and we still did not have any drinks. By this point, the large party next to us were already finishing their starters. Cue a second conversation with the hostess to speak with a manager. As my boyfriend spoke with the manager, two of the four drinks were delivered (the beer and the pelegrino...). By this point it had been 45 minutes and we still did not have all of our drinks or our food orders in. Another five or ten minutes later the server brought the rest of our drinks and went to check on the mussels. 

The manager, who was a nice guy, came by our table to apologize and asked if we wanted to get some food orders in. By this point, we let him know that we were going to pass on dinner and just close out after the appetizer. He apologized again and headed back to the kitchen to check on the mussels. He came back within a few minutes with the mussels and again asked if we would like to put any food in which we politely declined. Overall, the mussels were okay - not worth a 45 minute wait though. My pineapple margarita was not great, but not terrible and my friend said that her whiskey sour was amazing. All of the staff members and the manager were nice people, but it doesn't appear that service is on of their strong suits. I also wanted to note that nothing was comped or waived. Personally, as a former server, I might have waived something as an attempt to get my guests to give us a second shot, but not every restaurant operates that way so it's understandable. 

As much as we want to give the restaurant a second shot, we won't be visiting again."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"A long established tradition excels past any and all previous experiences shared at The Chase.  As a restaurant of quality and in a location of prominence in the heart of Santa Barbara, The Chase stands out not for resting on previous laurels and it's outstanding residence on State Street but for going beyond its stellar reputation and serving premier cuisine with an extraordinary menu and a professional and courteous staff.

The night we dined in perfect alfresco Santa Barbara weather, Brenda and Noah went every extra mile to accommodate us with exemplary service and offered wonderful suggestions.  As Brenda explained each item we queried, the decision on our final choices was extremely difficult to render yet our dinners were even better than were described.

Brenda was right; the veal parmigiana may be a tried and true choice in Italian cuisine but it is prepared so that well and the sauce was so perfect, it is now the best parmigiana I've ever had anywhere whether at home or in any other restaurant.  The sautéed garlic salmon is practically indescribable; it must be tried to be believed.

If chocolate cake is your thing, look no further than the Decadent Chocolate Cale is for you.

Noah and Brenda care about their customers and it shows.  I can't imagine a more wonderful dining experience than enjoying the delicious choices at The Chase and when you do, ask for Brenda and Noah; they will be so glad to see you.  We will be back!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Best Italian in town. The menu was incredible and made it difficult to choose an item. I ended up with the chicken parmigiana. Wine/cocktail/beer selection was good. Went with a large group and everyone loved their meals. Serving size is great. Will definitely return.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I went to Chase & it was awesome. Lola was my server. She gave us really great service. I had the al Capone to drink and the salmon with sautéed veggies. Highly recommended.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Santa Barbara is the perfect place to eat alfresco. This Italian restaurant is no exception.  They have many tables set up outdoors, with red table cloth and umbrellas, and socially distanced. 

Complimentary bread and butter is served. The coffee isn't that good and it's lukewarm, even the refill was lukewarm. I ordered the vegetarian cheeseburger, which comes with a side of french fries. Interesting. Can't tell what the vegetarian patty is made out of.  Otherwise, the meal was all good. I enjoy eating lunch outdoors. 

Service was friendly, but just ok."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Outside dining during covid was fine. Understandable that the service was rather slow. It was super hot today, yet our cups of ice water kept being left empty for a long time. Ordered chicken pesto sandwich and the bread was soggy from the sauce on the bottom. The chicken was extremely rubbery and flavorless(also was rubbery in the chicken Caesar salad.  Returned the chicken pesto sandwich and the waiter recommended the Carbonera penne pasta. This pasta seemed like they opened up a 2 year old can of premade pasta and plopped it into a pot and served it with some nasty bacon and cheese sauce. 
Would not recommend. All three dishes we tried were Terrible!
Don't like leaving bad reviews, but this was absolutely necessary...."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"After years of dining at The Chase, we now know never to go during Happy Hour.  If you're not spending over $75.00 per couple, which we were always happy to do, and you go during Happy Hour, the service is less than satisfactory.  When we arrived, once we heard that it was Happy Hour and ordered drinks, the waitress turned a deaf ear to us.  Pity because we have been there for many birthdays and anniversaries, plus we have brought good friends there to dine with us.  

It took forever and a day to get our drinks. Seventy five minutes later, we received our first of three ""appetizers"" .  After ten minutes, I went inside to get a fork, which the busboy got for us. 

We continued to wait for our calimari and Lobster Mac and cheese. Another couple who came in at the time of the first delivered appetizer, ordered a full dinner with calimari as an appetizer for themselves.  Within ten minutes, they received the calimari.  When we asked, our waitress said the kitchen was still cooking it and ""it takes time"".. When I told her that the table next to us just got it after ten minutes, she looked and just walked away.  In ten minutes, our Lobster Mac and Cheese arrived and I asked about the calimari - this is now 90 minutes since it was ordered.  She said ""Oh, did you still want the Calimari?""  I asked for the check.  She came baclk with the check and said the bartender must have taken our order.  I said that it went to the table next to us and she saw it.  She then said that it must have been the busboy who brought it to them and made a mistake.  

Did I tell you that we asked for water at 5:15 and by the time we left at 7:30, it still didn't come.  The waitress was handling the full price dinner patrons in the small room and 5 tables outside on the patio.  We were on the patio and every ""Happy Hour"" table suffered a similar fate.

Too bad because the food is good here.  The service is about the worst anywhere......unless you're spending the bucks which usually comes with a nice tip for the waitress; perhaps another incentive for her.  

A note to Sonya, the owner of The Chase ;  if you're going to offer a Happy Hour, make sure the staff knows to treat the customers the same as the other patrons. it's an incentive to bring people back for the full dinner.  This was our first Happy Hour experience there after years of the fine dining you provide.  We happened to come in at the time you were offering the Happy Hour and we were going to do the usual dinner we get. Waiting for the first appetizer was ridiculous and we knew not to eat dinner there.  After this one experience, which resulted in my wife and I becoming stressed and moody, we won't be back for quite some time.  We went to another fine restaurant in Santa Barbara (The Palace) and were treated great.

Goodbye to The Chase."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"2 stars for the waiting staff, 3 stars for the nice manager, 4 stars for the food because thank god the recipes are still the same! Went for Mother's Day, waitress got one of our orders wrong... twice. Also took 15 min to bring one glass of wine. Honestly I'm not sure if I'll go back, which is really sad because for over a decade I have loved the chase :-/"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"From the sever to management just indifferent to their poor service. I was blown away when the server could not get drinks, appetizer or entrees right we asked for the manager twice. Instead of probably coming over and dealing with the situation the manager turned his tail and coward in the back texting on his phone and bussing tables. And when confronted with his shortcomings he threw a tantrum seeming drunk and incoherent."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I've always wanted to try this place and finally got to for our date night. To be honest, the oldies music also drew me in this particular night. We sat outside near the beautiful patio area. I ordered a strawberry basil cocktail which was pretty strong. We ordered two appetizers, the fried calamari and the fresh steamed clams. For our entrees we both got the tomahawk steak, for my side I got spaghetti and marinara (unfortunately the photo I took came out super blurry and I made a rookie mistake of not taking multiple photos to choose from...ugh!). As far as appetizers go, the fried calamari was slight on the fishy side but the chipotle aioli was really good...it also came with the tentacles which most people don't like but it's my favorite part. The fresh steam clams was my favorite thing out of the whole dinner! When it first came out my jaws dropped because I could not believe how big these clams were(they seem to be quahog clams), the broth was perfect for me when it came to seasoning, it was not salty like most places tend to make it. I was also surprised by their garlic bread that came with the clams. The flavor was garlicky and not bitter, the bread was not too dry or overly toasted. Moving on to the tomahawk steak, it was cooked to perfection(I got mine medium rare), the seasoning was just salt and pepper(I have to give it to them for not overly making anything too salty). The side of spaghetti and marinara was also good too, normally I'm not the biggest fan of marinara sauce because it's usually too watery and bland but this one had actual depth, it felt like I was eating hearty bolognese sauce without the meat. The salad that came with it was a standard style dinner salad with your choice of dressing and I chose balsamic vinaigrette which I wasn't super fond of(too sweet for me taste buds).
By the way, the service was great and the waiter was amazing. So when they first brought out the steak the waiter also brought a glass of red wine to me and I was about to say we did not order a glass of wine but the waiter said this wine goes really well with the steak and that it was on him. So I tried the wine with the steak and he was spot-on!! 
It was a wonderful evening with great service and food! And awesome oldies music to groove along with while eating and drinking!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We were so disappointed in this restaurant.    The service was extreeeeemely  sloooowwww, food was cold and overcooked and orders were wrong.  Staff seemed confused and inexperienced."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"OK.. Been here numerous times over gawd knows how many years, and we love the food. But we had such HORRIBLE SERVICE on Sat NITE and the past couple of times that we have gone, that I felt I needed to post. 2 plus hours to get served. Had to ask for bread  after an hour as we were starving...  UP charges are an insult to 20 plus years patrons. Want vegies instead of pasta? Ask for it, but not told you get a huge service fee..Then just ask for carbonara sauce ON YOUR CHOICE OF PASTA ,  because they did ask what sauce u want... pay  1.50 extra, no heads up. Want  an anchovy on your Caesar?  You guessed it. Another upcharge. 
     Had to get  the receptionist to bring us salad. The only great thing about our dining at the Chase , was our service from Todd, the bartender.  I do not mind paying extra for special requests when given a heads up and when it is out of the ordinary. But the dinners are served with your choice of pasta on the side ( it IS an Italian restaurant) , and I feel it is riduculous to nit pic on the sauce  and charge extra, also not stating the additional fee. Returnimg customers should be made to feel appreciated, not for which to be  taken advantage.
    Also hoping that the poor customer service, other than Todd, is not going to be the norm... This restaurant has been in business enough years to properly staff and train for a busy weekend night. No excuses..."

-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Looks like they were able to delete my review, so here it is again ...

If Hell had a restaurant, it would be this one. I have never left a restaurant feeling so disrespected, frustrated, and angry. The audacity of their staff at multiple levels is truly impressive, and their unwillingness to accept responsibility is equally so.

We were seated for our reservation and our server (middle aged blonde lady) did not look happy to be there. After she unenthusiastically took our order, I asked for Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar and another member of our party asked for Baked Ziti with his Tomahawk Steak and a glass of white wine with the Yelp Check In discount. She mentioned that the Ziti would take longer and to check the 'Marked as Used' box on Yelp, acknowledging these orders.

A runner brought bread to the table, and I kindly reminded him about the olive oil and balsamic I had asked for. It took 45 minutes and flagging down 2 more runners and finally asking the Hostess to get it, at which point my food had arrived and I wasn't even interested in the cold bread anymore.

Our server never came by our table once between taking our order and putting down our plates, but when she finally did we politely reminded her of our wine order. She unapologetically asked for ID and acted as if we had never ordered it in the first place. A runner served the Tomahawk order, but instead of Baked Ziti, it was served with a baked potato. We politely informed her of the incorrect order, and she, without apologizing, explained that the kitchen must've read the order wrong and that 'it'll take a while.'

Admittedly, after receiving consistently unacceptable service for over an hour, our party was quite upset and we were less than subtle about voicing our dissatisfaction about the service to each other. We later found out that she overheard us saying that it 'the worst service we ever had.' While it was unfortunate she overhead us, it certainly was a deserved title.

As you can imagine though, things did not improve and we were met by uncomfortable glances and stares by the staff the remainder of the night.

After another 45 minutes of not receiving the Baked Ziti, I walked up to her (because God knows she wasn't checking up on our table) and politely asked her to check on it. She responded 'yeah, the kitchen won't be making it. I've asked them 5 times and they just will not be doing it.' Stunned and baffled by the blatancy of her rudeness, I immediately walked toward the Hostess and asked for a Manager.

The Hostess brought over the check about 5 minutes later and said 'I was told to give this to you.' I asked for the manager again, and she said that he was on the way. He came out about 20 minutes later, followed by what I assume (from some of the other reviews) was the bartender. The bartender puffed his chest like he was going to initiate a physical confrontation and accused us of name calling his servers, which we did nothing of the sort. The manager mentioned what the server had overheard, but I'm of the opinion that name calling and our opinion of her service are not the same thing.

The Manager apologized but gave many an excuse about the poor service.  He made it a point to mention how long our server had been in the restaurant industry and how hard it was for them to have outdoor dining.
And look, I understand that the F&B industry has had a rough year, and that the server is probably overworked and underpaid. Aren't we all? It's no excuse for unapologetically bad service. Even a sorry would've been nice. And, I'm sorry but as a server and as a business, if you can't figure out how to provide good service when you're charging the exorbitant prices that Chase does, maybe you shouldn't be in the business.

It's a shame that I had such a terrible experience here, because the meal itself was actually quite decent. The audacity of the staff here just left a bad taste in my mouth for dessert."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"My Chase Bar & Grill experience was the epitome of that show... Cheers. The place was packed and decorated perfectly for the holiday season. The only seating was at the bar. I made plenty new friends without a fuss. So, the atmosphere was completely friendly and inviting. 

The food was another story. The piccata dishes were well talked up, however, there was steak, lasagna and eggplant on the menu. I love eggplant. I couldn't pass on eggplant.... I ordered the eggplant rotellini and ginger beer. 

It was nicely served with bread, salad and spaghetti marinara. They served it up great. It tasted okay. The eggplant was hard as a rock. The herbed ricotta was all I tasted.... Dairylicious. However, I can say that it was a satisfying meal.

I'd go back to hang out. Also, try something else on the menu."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Took my girls out to a fine Italian restaurant as it was our first time in California from Southern Wisconsin. We ordered the brussel sprouts, pesto bread, prosciutto and arugula flat bread, and the rigatoni bolognese which in fact came out in this order. First, the side salad, then my utensils and our crusty day old albertsons french bread and waters. After an excruciating wait of almost an hour, the waitress approached our table and muttered, ""ur still waiting?"" as if we should know the reason our food did not arrive yet. Side note, observing her mannerisms and behavior, not only to our party but around the restaurant, led us to believe she was not sober in any sense. Her slurred vocabulary and delayed confused responses really emphasized her half massed eyes that glared into our innocent Wisconsin souls. When the food finally did come (entre first and room temperature) one of the most inexcusable restaurants mistakes plagued our rigatoni. A long blonde, curly, crispy, and oh so inedible hair was found integrated into my pasta. At this point we were so fed up i just decided to brush it off. The overdone and fried to a crisp brussel sprouts were delivered by a waiter with an attitude. A greasy, soggy, and salty prosciutto flatbread contained ""prosciutto"" five mm too thick and tough to be prosciutto, we believe we received pork chops. Upon arriving, everyone agreed that the pesto bread would be the star of our meal, however, we had finished the sad excuse for what was supposed to be a higher end Italian meal and the pesto was still no where to be found except on our check. At least five different waiters served our table yet it took another half hour to get the check. We are used to leaving generous tips in Wisconsin since we come from a small community of supportive villagers however with full confidence we decided to leave no tip for the intoxicated brunette waitress that did not know how to work the cash register. Thank you for your time please do not go here!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,It was delicious but over priced and cooker weren't wearing any gloves inside the kitchen disappointed
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Menu is over-priced for the quality of food served.   I had lasagne and my other half had chicken parmigiana.  Both were ""okay"" but not worth $28 for an entree with a house salad.  The other guests entrees were between $24 and $26 and were ""okay"".. but also not special for that kind of price.  The service was okay except the server misguided us .. we asked for additional bread and we were charged  $7... she explained it was an appetizer when we questioned it later.. and she also told us Caesar salad was included with our entree (but failed to mention there was an upcharge of $2).   I will think twice before going back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Nice quiet spot in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara. They have tables all over the front of the restaurant, some right on State street creating a very unique experience. Their iconic Italian decor and friendly atmosphere, makes them a family favorite. I had their famous bacon cheeseburger. It was grilled to perfection; AMAZING!  Their tiramisu is really awesome as well. 

PLUS! Parking is super easy since the city parking lot is literally on their back entrance."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I haven't felt the need to write Yelp reviews in years, but I feel the need to save someone from having the unacceptable experience we had here.  For starters, it took 1 hour to get our food.  I had to ask twice because we were certain they had forgotten about us.  When the food came out they messed up our order.   My son ordered Chicken Alfredo and got Fettuccini Alfredo.  The waitress apologized and brought chicken out once we were all done with our food.  The food's taste and quality was mediocre at best and not worth the price.  The Veal Milanesa was a giant fried piece of veal with way to much cheese.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was ok but was cold.  Then when we got our bill, they tried to charge us for 3 alcoholic beverages that we did not order.  We would have been better off having fast food.  Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Service (2/5): I felt embarrassed for the waitress serving us. She was not knowledgeable of the menu what so ever. We were asking her questions on the entrees and she didn't have any answers without looking at the menu. 

Food (2/5): I would much rather go to Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory to get better Italian food than this. The highlight of the meal was the pesto bread. Everything else was so under-seasoned and un-satisfying. 

Ambiance (4/5): I'd have to say that inside was decorated pretty nice.

Price (2/5): Too expensive for food that was definitely not worth its price."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went here with colleagues. Even though it was December, it was sunny enough to be able to sit outside. The bread that is provided upon arrival is rustic and that can be messy. Outdoor restaurant space in Santa Barbara is at a premium so I understand why the tables are squished together, but does make it difficult to move or shift. They have a good selection of Italian pastas and dishes. I'm an Alfredo person so picked their chicken Alfredo. Yes it cost $17, but they load the amount of grilled chicken on the plate, which isn't always the case at other Italian restaurants. The speed of our waitress was lacking - there were times when we waited up to 20mins before seeing her again. One time after waiting so long we asked the busser to call her for us. The restaurant looked busy, but that shouldn't be an excuse for being ignored beyond an acceptable standard."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,I loved it here! Came to Santa Barbara for a day trip and this was the only menu that interested my boyfriend and I.  We came here for lunch.They gave us a great spread of bread and different Italian dip's. We both ordered ravioli- mine was marinara and his was pesto. We both really enjoyed the food! The staff was also super nice and the waiter was attentive. Lol
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Ate here for lunch on the weekend. The decor and atmosphere was great. I definitely was a place that you could go and just a few drinks and relax.

The food and drinks were both great.

Not a good place for kids but a good place to take a client or date."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"So very disappointed in this restaurant that looks so charming from the outside. Decided to give it a try last night and not only was everyone in my party dissatisfied with their meals (after waiting close to an our for it to come out) the service was terrible. I had a waiter who introduced himself as ""tiger"" and he was incredibly strange and completely rude. I was astonished when he became angry at me when I asked him to correct a mistake that he made with my order, I have never been treated so terribly."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Had a reservation on valentine's day. Was not seated for over an hour, then 45 minutes to get our order taken. The waiter was nice but the restaurant was so disappointing. The people around us were all complaining as well. I wouldn't recommend this place especially for a nice occasion."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Getting seated was the fastest thing they did. After waiting for our server for about 30 mins he finally took our order. I should've known something was wrong when he wasn't writing down the order just memorizing it. After 15 mins, he accidentally walked by our table and pretended to confirm our order but he really he forgot it. After an hour and a half of waiting and one beer later, no food! My wife and I decided to walk out, do not eat at this place. What sucked is we made a reservation and it was extremely cold that night."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The hostess took my drink order, then forgot about it. 20 minutes later, I asked for my drink (notice I had to ask) and the order hadn't been put through. I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my drink. The waitress snapped at me and then apologized. (What!?) We had to ask for a bread basket. I had to get up to find the waitress so we could have the check. And, finally, the worst part: The bathroom was dirty. Is there any excuse for a dirty bathroom? No. Sorry, I'm a local but I will not be going back."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I hate to only give it a three stars because the waiter, Joey, was awesome and the food was really delicious. Decor is a bit tacky, so I was a little nervous.

While dining, two tables over the owner was on his cell speaker phone yelling and swearing at someone about a legal matter. Not cool. That really took away from the experience. If you go, try the homemade ravioli with pesto or the chicken piccata, just stay clear of the owner!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I do not recommend this place, we ordered calamari for appetizer,  it's the most  disgusting calamari I've ever had, it's stale. The bruschetta bread was stale, pasta had no flavor, so plain. Broccoli tasted like it's been steamed a day before, the chair where my daughter was seated was wet. Sorry folks, I just can't recommend it, do not waste your money, go somewhere else."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Cons
- We waited for an hour for our food after ordering
- Appetizer was not ready by the time our entrees were over
- Pasta was cold, hot molten chocolate was not hot . 
- They said they'll get 4th glass of water and plates - both of which never came! 

Pros
- Chicken Primevara was amazing! Marinara sauce was delicious.
- Outdoor Seating was good"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Be careful if you order take out - the orders are often (I'd say 50% of the time) wrong. Do you like salad dressing with your salad? Sorry, missing. Those two entrees for the kids? Hope they like Top Ramen tonight because they didn't include them in the order. Oh, and do you like clams you ordered on your pasta? Hope so.

So, if you order take out or delivery, beware."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This is a very special restaurant. 

I've always viewed The Chase as an upscale, fun place to dine. The interior is dark and cozy with white Christmas lights adorning the walls and pillars. It gives off a romantic vibe and is the ideal spot to patronize after a stressful workday. 

The food and the service have always been great. Personally, I love their chicken picatta - but you won't go wrong with anything on the menu here. The restaurant is well-staffed and I've always felt that the service has been nothing short of stellar.

This place, like most others on lower State Street, offers a large parklet dining area which complements the interior well. It's got more of a casual vibe than the indoor dining. I love their front bar. The cocktails are top notch. I could go for one of their martinis right now. 

Santa Barbara is home to a multitude of upscale Italian restaurants. This spot, in my opinion, is one of the best!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"One of my longtime favorite restaurants in Santa Barbara. food is always great. Since I have a serious problem with garlic, I have always been able to order my favorite Italian dishes without a problem. Todd always makes my favorite, Blue Moon Martini."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Horrible service; waiter seemed more interested in socializing and strutting around than doing his job  Asked about flatbread if sausage was spicy, was told no, mild  Imagine my surprise when I ate a piece and my mouth and lips burned intensely for 5 minutes! Not only that, crust was over baked  Waiter just played dumb when we complained  How does a POS place like this stay in business?  (I saw the other reviews ) Don't waste your time and money on this two bit slop house masquerading as a restaurant"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Poorly managed restaurant.  Food quality and service was subpar. Nice outdoor dining atmosphere but doesn't make up for mediocre food and bad service.  Reading the other reviews it's hard to believe they've survived 40 years in business.  There must've been an ownership change somewhere along the way. Whomever owns or manages this restaurant knows how to create a great outdoor atmosphere with the lighting, patio heaters and music, but the appeal ends there. They clearly don't understand how important service and food quality is in the restaurant business.  During this our first and only visit, service was very slow.  The waitress didn't seem knowledgeable about anything especially the wine selection. They list several different Chardonnays on their menu along with a list of wine specials that list four different Chardonnays, but all they had were two varieties and they weren't very good.  The bread was cheap and tasteless. The minestrone soup was served at room temperature, and the cheese ravioli was just okay. My wife and I split a Caesar salad and they placed it in the middle of the table.  We asked several times for a sharing plate which they never brought, so we just sat there and picked salad out of the bowl. The wait staff was very polite but they were just clueless. Good luck to the owners surviving the next 40 years. Perhaps they should write a letter to Chef Gordon Ramsey.   This place would be perfect for an episode of Kitchen Nightmares."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Literally the worst evening at a restaurant I've ever experienced. Writing a1 star review is not how I anticipated this review. 
I brought my entire family to enjoy a pre-mother's day dinner. (I'd only been during lunch and service/ food were just fine.) From the moment our waitress brought our drinks there were mistakes. She didn't apologize, she just blankly stared at us while we tried to explain what was wrong. She took the wrong drinks and brought new ones- she didn't fix all the the drink issues though the other half of the tables needs were not met. Appetizers were forgotten... The food took forever (though if you were lucky enough to get food it was delicious) , and there were issues with 1 meal, and another was completely forgotten. Again, no apologies, no check in to see if we were okay (which we were not) literally nothing. My sisters meal (chicken picatta)  came with marinara sauce on spaghetti noodles instead of picatta sauce or Alfredo. We requested that she bring out a side plate of fettuccine Alfredo, and she brought a bowl of gelatinous Alfredo sauce, no noodles just a bowl of sauce?! We asked her what we were supposed to do with that? Mix it with the marinara?! No apology, nothing just stared at us. We asked to speak with the manager- she went over to him stood talking with him for 2 min, he went and spoke with 4 other tables and never came to talk with us and the waitress never came back. We were thoroughly frustrated at this point and asked another server to bring our check. Then we spoke with the manager about why he never came to our table - he shook is finger in my face as if I'd something wrong. Didn't care to hear anything about our evenings experience and honestly seemed a few glasses of vino deep. I've never been more frustrated at a lack of service. They held us hostage for an additional 30 minutes just trying to get the check & pay  (which they charged for things we didn't get and double charged for my sister's messed up). 

Needless to say never going back - I hope they get some new management and servers that can anticipate needs and get a dinner order right."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"hair in our food, intoxicated waitress, 2 hr wait, watery pasta, no appetizers, overcharged us"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Came here for our date night. Originally we were going to go to another restaurant, but they were closed so we walked around until we came up on this Restaurants menu, and I was drawn in by the tomahawk steaks. We decided to sit outside where they had heat lamps for those who get cold easily and oldies but goodies in the background. We ordered the fried calamari, fresh steamed clams, and Tomahawk steaks. The fried calamari had to slight fishiness to it, so we had to add the lemon ( reunion has better calamari if you like the body only), but their chipotle aioli was a good addition. The Chipotle aioli had a little bit of smoke and not too much heat. The steamed clams shocked us because we were expecting tiny ass clams but these were ginormous! The broth in the clams were very flavorful without being salty, and the garlic bread was a good addition, so we could dunk the bread in the broth after we were done with the delicious clams. When the entree came out, my Tomahawk Steak was cooked to perfection, rare like I like it. The potato was just a potato, and the veggies -nothing spectacular,but the real star was the tomahawk steak. Nice, tender and juicy. Will note our waiter provided exceptional service.  He would check up on us regularly, and he also gave my wife a wine enjoy with her steak because he thought it went really well with the steak, which he was spot on."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Save your money. 
I honestly wished I went to the grocery store and bought boxed pasta or a TV dinner from the frozen foods section. 
Bruh this was hometown buffet grade and how the hell does one mess up a salad? 
I'm looking forward to what I can eat tomorrow because this was bad and unfortunately this was my mother's birthday dinner. 
The bathroom also felt grimy as if a cockroach was ready to make an appearance. 
I don't like leaving reviews like this especially with the pandemic, but this was a meal that I felt could not get screwed up. Hoping they put more respect on the food they put out in the future."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Pretentious, expensive, and a lot of huff for what it delivers. This is my 2nd visit. I was first attracted by the ambience but once you're inside it's clear that the place is in desperate need of some upgrading; or maybe joining the 21st century...   

The older guy is a good bartender and as it is with the ""high end"" appearance this place pretends to project, he seems to understand that  a certain degree of savoir-faire and class is important when interacting with customers. 

On the other hand, on this 2nd visit my wife and I had the misfortune of encountering the bar chic... First of all, she is out of place and judging by her attitude, she is contemptuous of the customers she makes a living from...  This is in terms of her service and the drinks she makes too. Among her fails, she made comments (she was noticeably irritated) to 2 co-workers (busboys) at the bar such as : ""people are stupid...!"" when the bar was literally full of customers... (?) Not a good idea when she's 3 feet ear distance from all of them. Typical case of someone who thinks her job is beneath her. if you can do better... go for it, what are you doing as a mediocre bartender ?

The food is definitely overpriced for what they serve. The New England style clam chowder was decent, but the chicken picatta : which according to her : ""...It's what we're known for..."" just plain sucks.

As I said pretentious and expensive. They are on State St. Santa Barbara.. They need to learn how to make food for the people they may attract by the ""look"" they project... Which as I said, it's somewhat chic european, cozy restaurant/bar atmosphere. 

When you walk in, you realize that's it. All they had was a good decorator... (although now, if you look closely you realize the place is no question poorly maintained, unfresh and sadly outdated) and that's that..."

At the new table, the heater was not warm, so if you go at night, bring an extra jacket to bundle! It took quite awhile for them to come and take our order or for us to have a waitress at all. Our food took another 15-20 mins after that. The fried ravioli was just okay (although my friends really liked) and the chicken alfredo had a hint of lemon flavor which i did not enjoy. It is a bunch of food though, enough for leftovers. I probably would not go again."

Their music is also just lovely."

The evening started out with the waitress bringing me the wrong wine,sent it back, The bread was stale when I told the waitress about it she said ""I know I told them"".
The veal was unremarkable, the salad was the same as you get  at Trader Joe's in a package, The pasta was not the one I had requested and had to send that back too. Whole dinner was a failure and it was not inexpensive.
Won't be back."

Traditional Italian cuisine. I've had their chicken piccata and another time, shrimp piccata. Both piccata dishes were delicious! My husband had their meat lasagna and another time the chicken Milanese. He enjoyed it! 

Their strawberry basil vodka is sweet, more like a dessert cocktail. 

Their tiramisu is delicious!

Outdoor seating is very nice and cozy!"

Food was amazing, service was not amazing in the sense that we waited a while for our waitress a few times but she was very nice.

We were seated for our reservation and our server (middle aged blonde lady) did not look happy to be there. After she unenthusiastically took our order, I asked for Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar and another member of our party asked for Baked Ziti with his Tomahawk Steak and a glass of white wine with the Yelp Check In discount. She mentioned that the Ziti would take longer and to check the 'Marked as Used' box on Yelp, acknowledging these orders.

A runner brought bread to the table, and I kindly reminded him about the olive oil and balsamic I had asked for. It took 45 minutes and flagging down 2 more runners and finally asking the Hostess to get it, at which point my food had arrived and I wasn't even interested in the cold bread anymore. 

Our server never came by our table once between taking our order and putting down our plates, but when she finally did we politely reminded her of our wine order. She unapologetically asked for ID and acted as if we had never ordered it in the first place. A runner served the Tomahawk order, but instead of Baked Ziti, it was served with a baked potato. We politely informed her of the incorrect order, and she, without apologizing, explained that the kitchen must've read the order wrong and that 'it'll take a while.'

Admittedly, after receiving consistently unacceptable service for over an hour, our party was quite upset and we were less than subtle about voicing our dissatisfaction about the service to each other. We later found out that she overheard us saying that it 'the worst service we ever had.' While it was unfortunate she overhead us, it certainly was a deserved title. 

As you can imagine though, things did not improve and we were met by uncomfortable glances and stares by the staff the remainder of the night. 

After another 45 minutes of not receiving the Baked Ziti, I walked up to her (because God knows she wasn't checking up on our table) and politely asked her to check on it. She responded 'yeah, the kitchen won't be making it. I've asked them 5 times and they just will not be doing it.' Stunned and baffled by the blatancy of her rudeness, I immediately walked toward the Hostess and asked for a Manager.

The Hostess brought over the check about 5 minutes later and said 'I was told to give this to you.' I asked for the manager again, and she said that he was on the way. He came out about 20 minutes later, followed by what I assume (from some of the other reviews) was the bartender. The bartender puffed his chest like he was going to initiate a physical confrontation and accused us of name calling his servers, which we did nothing of the sort. The manager mentioned what the server had overheard, but I'm of the opinion that name calling and our opinion of her service are not the same thing.

The Manager apologized but gave many an excuse about the poor service.  He made it a point to mention how long our server had been in the restaurant industry and how hard it was for them to have outdoor dining.
And look, I understand that the F&B industry has had a rough year, and that the server is probably overworked and underpaid. Aren't we all? It's no excuse for unapologetically bad service. Even a sorry would've been nice. And, I'm sorry but as a server and as a business, if you can't figure out how to provide good service when you're charging the exorbitant prices that Chase does, maybe you shouldn't be in the business.

It's a shame that I had such a terrible experience here, because the meal itself was actually quite decent. The audacity of the staff here just left a bad taste in my mouth for dessert."

Today I stopped in and Edgar took great care of me -enjoyed the shrimp Parmesan, delicious, with a salad and glass of wine and a beautiful outdoor patio... thank you for the great service and food!!
It's so nice especially during these tough times when service is in short supply to have such excellent attention paid to you... Thanks again Edgar!! Such a lovely afternoon!"

Waiting for 30 for a salad and only realized it wasn't coming when my waitress was leaving and said the other girl was supposed to help you. It never got ordered. Lame service,over worked and under supported by absent managers. These guys used to be good. Crap now."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I really wanted to like this restaurant. The server was nice and not his fault. As we were seated, we kept on hearing the female manager at the front saying how understaffed they were and she was STRESSED, but the outdoor seating was only half full. The food was so gross. The angel hair puttanesca looked disgusting. The pasta was over cooked and was in little chunks and the sauce was brown and looked burnt and crispy on top. Maybe under the heat lamp too long? The linguine with clam sauce was okay but was literally swimming in a pool of nasty oil. Service was slow. Ruined our graduation meal."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Great restaurant in down town Santa Barbara. The muscles are great appetizer. Nice outside atmosphere.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Zero for service. After we were served wine and appetizer.  No one ever came and asked how we were doing. After 1 hr and 25 mins still no food. 
Manager called more time from other tables about other topics, and no real explanations.
Also zero for food. My food was very very very salty. As if it was half of salt bottle inside."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Had to leave a review for this restaurant not only for the food but for the stellar service we received, especially in light of the challenges Covid presents for restaurants. My friend and I dined here in their outdoor seating section and were really impressed by the romantic ambiance the restaurant managed to create while also taking extra precautions to keep their patrons safe. The tables are generously spaced which seemed rare compared to other businesses on State Street that crammed tables together, which can make me nervous especially when everyone has their masks off to eat. 

When we arrived, we were warned that our food may take awhile because the kitchen was inundated with orders, and I appreciated their candor. But we never felt like we were waiting long since our friendly server - Diego - was incredibly attentive and made sure we always had drinks and appetizers while we waited on our main courses.  Everything we ordered was flavorful, delicious, and easily worth any wait. I would definitely come back here and recommend it to anyone I know planning to safely dine on State Street."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,this is the BEST manhattan clam chowder i have ever had. the waiter said they won an award for it and deservedly so. holy crap. if you normally hate manhattan clam chowder - get this stuff
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,We walked 10 blocks to come to the chase because I really wanted the muscles. The muscles never came out the salad came out our entrées came out and obviously they forgot the muscles.... Instead of an apology it was t together server  saying that somebody else was supposed to bring them out it took forever to get a drink a husband's food was cold . Never had a manager come over and check on this and apologize we had to ask again for a to-go box and again for our check very disappointed poor management !!!!
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"My husband and I had THE MOST ROMANTIC lovebird brunch today. The food was splendid, and we adored Rosa and her amazing service, sincerity and humor. You can tell she really loves people. It was was an amazing experience today, and she deserves a raise!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"This is my husband and I's favorite Italian food in town. The service is usually just ok but the food speaks for itself. On Mothers Day, despite ordering early, the place was chaos. The man working looked like he could care less, had his mask down onto his neck, and didnt help the one frantic waitress the entire time I was there. After 45 minutes of her running around frantically, i finally got her to talk to me and she said they lost my order. I was so frustrated at the time I wasted there. I wrote them an email with no reply. For now, we decided to support other local businesses that seem to need and want the support."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Terrible service! There was literally 10 families and they couldn't handle that! The only thing that ever came out was bread and water. The margaritas never came out the main dishes never did either. My mother got her side dish before she got her coke, and a server that was not my server finally got our margaritas because we asked. Margs came out extremely sour and we were simply over it. Then when we finally cancel the entire transaction and then they take forever to bring the check for the nothing that we got. Terrible! Don't start your holiday weekend here! They need to get their stuff together for a restaurant that has been in the business since 1979!!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Due to service, I would NOT return. Upon arriving around 3:40, we were told to pick a seat and as we did, a gentlemen working there asked us to move from the 4 seat table we chose to sit at a 2 seat table instead. It wasn't a big issue, however the place was almost empty with only like 2 other couples and plenty of other 4 seat tables so I thought it was a bit uncalled for and way to treat your customers. We were then told that lunch ends at 4  & that the menu was on the table. We ordered FROM THAT MENU before 4pm to meet the time cut off, however when we were presented with the bill, they charged us for the dinner portions which we never asked for or anything. When we brought it to the waitresses attention, she acted very helpless and like she couldn't do anything about this ""misunderstanding."" They deliberately took advantage of us by up-charging & blaming it on ""miscommunication"" but they knew what they were doing. Will not be returning. COME HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK $$$$"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"A while ago, April 23, 2018, I sent this letter and I don't believe I ever received a reply; it is now April 2, 2019:

Jackie Mathis, Owner Chase Bar and Grill
1012 State Street
Santa Barbara, California 93101

Dear Mr Mathis:

Yesterday, April 22, Sunday, my family and I decided to eat at the Chase Bar and Grill in Santa Barbara. My daughter attends UCSB and we wanted to take her out for lunch as a
special treat. We are not locals but I did ask a local about the food and received very positive comments about Chase so we decided to eat at your restaurant.  

My daughter ordered the salmon with Alfredo sauce; she enjoyed this dish very much. My wife and I ordered the grilled salmon over arugula salad. I asked the server to tell the chef not to over-cook my salmon. When our salad arrived, my salmon was raw on the inside and the arugula was a predominately a faded green color with many, many yellow leaves and a few slimy arugula leaves. My wife, ever the person who does not complain, did not touch the arugula. She was afraid the salad would make her sick.  She told me that if she did not have bread to eat with the meal that we would have to go elsewhere for lunch. I asked our waiter to have the chef replace my arugula wih a fresher batch but the arugula that was brought to me was no fresher. My wife and I ate he salmon which was delicious. I asked our waiter to tell the manager that the arugula was ""totally unacceptable."" Our waiter apologized over and over about our salad but offered no solutions to the situation. 

What struck me is that we were not offered an alternative to our meal. Perhaps, we could have been given another type of salad/vegetable to go with our salmon. Unfortunately, we were not offered that alternative, and I did not pursue it because my wife and daughter do not like unpleasantness, and I did not want to disrupt my daughter's special treat.

Our waiter, Noah can verify my story as he is not soon to forget us and the meal my wife and I did not enjoy. We did not hold Noah responsible for our meal as he was not to blame for an unacceptable meal, and we left him about a 15% tip  anyway. I do not plan on writing a negative review of your restaurant, but I need to express my deep unhappiness over paying for a meal that can sicken a restaurant patron because it is sub-standard in freshness and totally unacceptable to serve customers; this along with the fact that we were not offered a reasonable alternative to the substandard meal in order to remedy the situation in a mutually agreeable manner resulted in a
very negative situation.


Note:  I omitted the ending to the letter.  I also, purposefully ,waited for a reply.  However, I believe no response was forthcoming.  Although I had not planned on writing a review before receiving a response to the letter, I believe now was the time to submit my letter instead of writing a review. The letter gives a better accounting of our experiences at Chase."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Really bad service waited 20 minutes with not a sole talking to me told host and he said I don't blame you no sorry or let me help you ... we left never again it seems like they really don't cate about good service it used to be good
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,Once again have to applaud chase. Nothing but incredible every time. The service is always very fast and friendly and personable making it feel like a very old school classic Italian dining experience. The food is always cooked to perfection. The atmosphere is amazing. For sure one of the best restaurants in SB.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Terrible hamburger.  Dry and flavorless.  Same goes for the salad.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Have you ever been to a restaurant were spaghetti and meatballs = spaghetti and one meatball! Ridiculous! Tasted like a cafeteria meal. Sad but true.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I'll start with the good.  The puttanesca was quite good.  I had that entree.  Now the fair and the bad:  The bread was cheap and not very fresh.  Bread is the 1st item patrons receive.  Bad way to start a meal.  Bad way to make a good impression.  The lamp chops were lamb ""loin"" chops (much cheaper cut) and only fair, b/c they were tough.  My wife had those.   My wife ordered a vodka gimlet.  It had to be sent back as it was peachy in color (for some reason) and contained no simple syrup.  My wife ordered broccoli as her side, did not arrive until we had to ask twice. I ordered sausage to be added to my pasta dish.  Never arrived until we bugged the waitress and a bus boy twice.  When it arrived it was good, but I was already done with my pasta dish.  I also ordered a side of sautéed spinach.  Once again, until we reminded the server and a bus boy, it came out.  Although the sum result of the food was a 2 1/2-3, one goes to a restaurant for fun, for relaxation, for good service.  They took off our extra side dishes and the sausage off the bill without us asking, which meant that they ""owned their mistakes"".  But, our intention was to have a lovely dinner experience and to pay the bill we were intended to pay for the food and for the service.  Not a pleasant, relaxing experience fir a restaurant that has been in business for a long time.  Probably won't head back there again.  We live in Santa Barbara and we'll frequent places where we feel comfortable and at ease when we order. Too bad.  Nice location on State Street, but they failed the test,"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The great atmosphere draws you into this sidewalk restaurant- twinkle lights, piano players, cute umbrella's and a friendly hostess. We were seated outside -table for two.They were a bit short staffed- the bartender was our waiter and he was trying his best. We ordered a nice bottle of red wine- it arrived hot to the touch-( we asked for an ice bucket). The food is ok,, the bread was partially stale, the red sauce very high in acid and HEAVY- thick- eventually found the chicken underneath-meh. The Veal Ostra w Carbonara- tasty- indulgent-rich- salty. I'd be tempted to try again- nothing with red sauce, perhaps a salad and white wine."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"We were glad to go to a restaurant that wasn't overly crowded.  Granted we had reservations but it was still nice not to have to deal with a massive crowd during a busy holiday weekend.  The service was friendly but slow and messed up a little with our salad order.  We had requested a blue cheese dressing with our garden salad and instead got a Caesar salad but didn't say anything and ate it anyway.  The texture of the calamari was a little more chewy than it should be and the seasoning although flavorful was lacking salt.  The salmon was cooked perfectly but again although it had seasoning, it was lacking the proper balance in flavors.  They were out of fettuccini pasta so we requested linguini which wasn't really a big deal.  Their Alfredo sauce is definitely unique.  It's is more buttery and creamy.  It didn't taste like the typical Alfredo sauce you get at most restaurants which is actually a good thing.  The longer it sat, the more delicious is got.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and had a fairly decent experience considering the current situation with Covid and that we were actually sitting in the street lol"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I've had this bookmarked as a place I've wanted to go for a while and it lived up to expectations. I'm not big on Italian food so I got the chopped Cobb and it was so well blended together with all the flavors and presented wonderfully. A great portion size so I got to bring the other half home to enjoy again! I'm a sweet potato fry fanatic so I had to get some and I told myself I would only eat half, but I ended eating the whole thing! They were delicious and the perfect crunch. Could have done with a little less salt, but hey, salt just makes them more addictive I guess.
My fiancé had the bacon jalapeño burger and he loved it, he also said the fries were PERFECT."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"First, let me preface that they didn't seem staffed for 6:30 PM on a Friday night.

Sat for about 10 min before server came and asked us for drinks, she then noticed we didn't have water or bread.

We took advantage of the attention and ordered 2 cocktails from their menu. Nothing crazy other than Makers instead of Jack Daniels in one drink and calamari.

It was a super strange interaction, I mentioned getting the bruschetta which the server met with a disgruntled sigh & less than enthusiastic eye roll.

So we ordered the calamari...

It took over 10 more min for our drinks to come, I thought I was being impatient so I timed a similar interaction on my phone - a table had their food, asked for another round. It took 11 min for the drinks to come out, of which was a sauv blanc when they ordered a cab sauv.... so the glass was sent back.

We ordered the filet medium rare... it came well done + the shrimp scampi.... that came with Alfredo. The menu says all entres come with veggies : ( my shrimp had 0 greenery other than the side salad.

The shrimp was cooked great, and the calamari was killer. I'm just bummed because they had such potential.

We're visiting, but I can say we won't be back this weekend."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Top 3 Italian resteraunts on my list. I come for George, the fettucine alfredo, chicken noodle soup (wednesdays) and creamy potato (mondays). Their soup alone is to die for! Service lacks a little. I had a waitress totally botch my order and made the worst ceaser salad I have ever had there (ive had atleast 25 before). The atmosphere is great. Although the booths are lovely...get served at the bar!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Very disappointing night at The Chase. Decided to take my family out to dinner. We understood that it was still COVID time and also understood that staff was doing the best they could. 

With that being said, it was still terrible. We waited 30 mins (which was expected) when we finally got sat at our table, it wasn't the best table. The chairs were falling apart and on the verge of breaking. When we finally got sat it was around 7:50. It took us maybe about 15-20 mins to place our orders for two adults and a kids pizza. Another 20 mins goes by and we still haven't gotten our appetizers. The appetizers finally come and they were very good! Fish chowder was amazing and the Cesar salad was great! It's now 8:40 and we notice that people who sat after us is getting their food. We ask one of the bussers to check in on our meal. He came back and told us that he was looking for the sever. Another 10 mins goes by and the server comes and she tells us that ""the tickets must've gotten mixed up."" Then she says that our meal should be coming out soon. Another 10 mins goes by and I tell one of the bussers that we would just like to pay for the drinks that we received and the kid pizza (to-go) that still hasn't came out. He once again said I will give this to the server. Poor kid didn't know what to do. 

My girlfriend then tells the head hostess that we would just like the check and we don't want the food. We didn't want the food because it wasn't worth eating at home (Lamb chops and Pork chop). One last food runner came out and told us that our food was being plated if we still wanted it. At this point it's 9:25pm. Still no food on the table or bagged to go. Finally at 9:29 the food comes on plates after we told three people that we didn't want it. I understand that it's Covid and staff are doing their best but this wasn't it. We felt like we were being held hostage to buying the food after we told them three times that we didn't want it. I saw a former co worker of mine working there and he was busting his butt but he worked at the bar. 

We bought the food to go and they gave us a 50% discount and a free slice of cheesecake which was cool but we were overall we were disappointed and upset. It's even more disappointing considering that this is one of our favorite restaurants in town. Chase I'll know you'll see better days tonight just isn't one of them. Very disappointing."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Good for a glass of wine or pint to break up your day on State Street but that's about it.

Happiness all over (think of Madonna Inn) with xmas lights, hearts and silk flowers. It's cozy with dark woods and high ceilings. The patio is small but offers a nice vantage point to watch the tourists go by. Mixed crowd of young, date night, older and in between.

I've been in many times for drinks but only once for dinner. Some out of town guests requested a revisit and said their steak was good. Never having eaten there, I'm in. 
Nope, the steaks were sad, smaller than expected and tough. Nothing compared to Holdren's or many other meat and potatoes places near.

Knowing I'm not going to eat here, we decided to pop in for drinks on a Saturday afternoon recently. Beer for me. Had three and each was poured in the same glass. I don't think so.

If you happen to be walking by and crave a glass of wine, pop in and take a load off. Finish your adult beverage and move on."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,The waiter seemed very nice but completely ill-equiped to be working in a resturant. 20 mins to get drinks (ice teas not bar drinks) over an hour to get appetizers ( after complaining) during which he never even checked on us and after 2 hours our food had still not arrived. The hostess even tried to argue with me saying they were slammed and blamed their poor service on the cooks. I might add there were more empty seats than full. We left before eating... Though the fried raviolis we had for appetizers were really good....
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"On my weekend getaway to Santa Barbara, I was able to peruse State Street and I'm so happy that Chase was able to remain open.  Considering all of the things with COVID, being able to eat out is a welcome relief.

They have taken every precaution with outdoor seating, social distancing, and personal protective equipment - I felt very safe dining here and it was a wonderful experience.  Big thank you to the staff for quick service and being able to accommodate to all of these changes.

As for the food, I had the Veal Valle de Ostra and that hit the spot perfectly.  The flavor was strong but not overpowering and the portions were fitting for the price.  Outside of the main course, bread and butter was plentiful.

I would recommend this restaurant, and I would definitely come back again if I'm in the area.  I would definitely recommend anybody else in the area to support a local restaurant."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,I went on Monday March 30 at 7:30 for dinner as we were visiting from out of town. Got seated right away and loved the ambiance of the place. When it came time to order they were out of bread and meatballs. Mind you this is an Italian Restaurant. Since when does an Italian restaurant run out of bread and meatballs.We ordered appetizers (Brussels Sprouts) that took 45 minutes to come out our entrees didn't come out till an hour and 10 minutes. The food was average at best definitely not worth an over hour wait. My ravioli came out partially cold. The manager or waitress never apologized for the long time it took to get our food. They even had the nerve to charge me 1.50 for meat sauce. Nothing was comped on bill which most reputable places will do when something likes this happens. Would never go back here again.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Once again our favorite restaurant excels in every way.  Jack and his staff are wonderful. Today, it was Erica who served us and she was delightful and such a happy spirit. She is a fine example of someone who enjoys her job and the people she works with. The food was impeccable; Shrimp Parmigiana for me and Salmon for my wife.  No restaurant can compete. We live in the SFV and make it a practice to visit SB just to make certain we have a great meal at the Chase.  There is nothing that is superior to fine Italian cuisine than this establishment. Their home made marinara sauce is as precious as the original recipe for Coca-Cola. We don't know exactly how they do it and it keeps bringing  us back.
Thank you Jack, Erica (who kindly posed for a holiday photograph with us) and The Chase."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Went to Chase restaurant today in Santa Barbara Calif. The patio look great nice and welcoming so we had dinner indoors for the  first time in awhile. The beginning of the dinner went great..the bread came out first by the hostest..them then appetizers. Calamari and bruschetta was delicious .  Then we things started going down hill. We ordered 2 caeser salads.. both salads were warm with very little dressing .. so we asked for more. Wasn't great because the salad was somewhat wilted. Then the main course came out. My food was completely wrong. Apparently there are 2 types of dishes both with fish and pasta. I ordered salmon and angel hair pasta..and what l l received was snapper and fettuccine Alfredo. I was in the middle of my dinner when finally the waitress came back to our table and I asked her if my plate was a steamed salmon.. she said ""No, you have the wrong dish. That's snapper instead of salmon."" She knew she was in the wrong because she was the waitress that brought our food out to begin with. So, in the end she gave me my original order of salmon and angel hair pasta to go. I was done at this moment.   Upon getting the bill.. we noticed she charged me for the higher price item (the salmon  vs the snapper) then my original order I ate. Who does that??!! None the less it was good tasting. Just won't go back again anytime soon."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Okay food and service but was offended beyond words when we were informed that they had a reservation waiting for our table.  During this busy holiday season I can forgive over booking a bit but not when our reservation was at 6:30 and they rudely interrupted our conversation at 7:30 to ask us to finish up.  
Unfortunately, our tradition of a holiday dinner with family along with additional dinners throughout the year has come to an end."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was fun, but the service was awful.  This snotty waitress seemed to refuse to serve us, which delayed our seating by almost ten minutes.  Once seated, this waitress made it a point to attend to every table around us and give us annoyed looks whenever possible.  She made it seem as though serving us was a chore and we should have been ashamed to burnden so.  The different waiter that eventually helped us was courteous and knowledgeable, but I do not think we will be returning anytime soon.  I'll be sure to call ahead and make sure this waitress is not working if I ever consider returning."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews for this place, but i've always enjoyed my time here. It's been here for years and as many restaurants have come and gone this one has stayed put. The service isn't the best that I'll agree with, but its dimly lit, comfortable and the food isn't bad at all. It's on upper state so that makes it a great place to end your shopping adventure."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,Slow service. Drinks were not made as ordered. Tonic was flat even after complaining. No lemon with shrimp cocktail. No offer of fresh ground pepper with salads. House dressing was not Italian and tasted like sour mayonnaise. Entrees were decent.
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Never will go there again.  I've had my credit card double charged in the past, and it took well over a month to resolve.  This Solstice, gave my drink order to the bartender, who said ""wait a minute"" and turned and served his friends.  I will never set foot in their again unless someone else i paying.  Why would I go somewhere with bad service, when I can go to Joe's and Dargan's and get waited on my awesome bartenders who are there to serve the customers and not their friends!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"The environment is great by the lighting around at night and the waiters look friendly, but the food is not very special than others."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I had Christmas eve dinner here with my mom. The restaurant was very nicely decorated and pretty busy too. The food was ordinary, unfortunately. I really enjoyed the ambience, but thought the food left a lot to be desired. It was nothing special. I had the lasagna, and it was salty and blend. Come for the restaurant's ambience and a drink, but not for the food."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"Came for a quick drink after Farmer's Market, had so much fun we ended up staying for hours.  Such a beautiful setting, front of the restaurant is wide open to watch State St waltz by. Bartender was fun to talk to, his service was attentive but laid back.  Loved the strawberry basil cocktail and the La Rossa Italian beers really hit the spot.  Edward Island steamed mussels were irrisistible, large plate of balsamic glazed brussel sprouts appetizer was perfect.  Loved the creamy white bean appetizer & porvaka spicy cabbage.  Our tired arms said thank you for the bar hooks for holding our groceries.  Will definitely come back soon!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"My BFF and I met in Santa Barbara for our yearly visit for our Birthdays and had a lovely lunch at Chase, our busboy was so sweet 10th generation Santa Barbian, his name was Noah, he was very attentive. Food was delicious, my friend had the arugula salad with Salmon and I had the Mahi Mahi with sautéed veggies in wine and butter, and of course some white wine to complete the meal"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,positive,"This spot was absolutely delicious! We made a reservation for dinner this past weekend and were not disappointed. They have adapted so well to the age of COVID-19 and we felt totally safe during our entire evening. Our waiter - Frankie - was excellent and attentive and kept his mask on the entire time. 

There was live piano music and the outdoor atmosphere was great. It was our first dinner 'out' in 5+ months due to COVID-19 and it was a great way to ease back into the 'real world' safely. 

Thanks to Chase for making our evening so great. Order the ravioli!"
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"Both the hostess and bartender exude disgusting and disrespectful attitudes that show overt prejudice towards non Whites. Their hostility towards non Whites ensures this restaurant remains a Whites Only establishment. Case in point: When ordering take away meal from the bar, the bartender treated the white and white passing Hispanic men very respectfully; however, he snapped at me, rushed me during my order, and talked down to me. While the men received their orders very quickly, mine never arrived. At all. When I inquired the hostess snapped in a very hostile tone the food is coming and that I needed to be patient. I told her not to address me in that hostile tone and asserted that she needed to check on the food order because I did not believe she put it in. She wanted to argue with me until I demanded she check on the food. Evidently she complained to the bartender (the same guy who gave me grief) and he came out. He demanded to know why I was harassing ""his"" hostess.( Very disturbing--No woman is any property of anyone.) I cut him to the quick, and demanded to speak with the manager to get a refund, because I wanted no more of this nastiness from any of the employees at this place.  The barkeep offered every excuse under the sun to prevent me from speaking to the manager. So I demanded he needed to do his damn job and get the manager immediately. A few minutes later, the manager arrived and looked very concerned. I told him that the hostess lied and never put in my food order and the bartender treated me very disrespectfully by word and by action. The bartender became loud , belligerent and cursed me in front of the manager. I growled at the man and told him to watch his mouth while he processed the refund. I received my refund and never looked back.

In essence the bartender and the hostess have no respect for non whites who have money because they think they're uppity. The bartender has zero respect for ethnic women because he curses around women and refer to them as ""his"". Although this place looks nice on the outside, it is very ugly on the inside with poor service and prejudiced employees with horrible attitudes."
-3AooxIkg38UyUdlz5oXdw,Chase Restaurant,Italian,negative,"I will cut them some slack for being understaffed due to covid, however the food was not worth the hour long wait for. I ordered the Pappardelle with vodka sauce and it was fine, no real flavor and some parts of the dish were really cold. My partner ordered the flatbread and it was very small, I could have made one that tasted the same at home. So overall, not worth the price, but not inedible. They also messed up the order for the table next to us, clearly things are a bit disorganized. We were in a rush so we just sat down here, ALWAYS check reviews first."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I'm being generous by giving this restaurant 2 stars. The service was so appalling that the fact that the food was actually ok is this place's only saving grace. I think we saw our waiter a total of 3 times the entire evening. We were never greeted after we were seated. We had to ask the Maitre'd if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked. Once we finally ordered, we were out of water. After asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived. And from that point until after we received our food, we never saw our waiter again. I asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came. Finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when I told him I didn't want it any more, he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket. Not my problem! We were never asked if we wanted dessert, we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didn't need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience. As if he was going to get a tip in the first place. Getting tipped requires providing a service which he hardly did. I would say, don't expect a lot from this mediocre Italian place."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Great vibe, great food.  Stands out even in a town with lots of good eats."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Great Food! Lots of Gluten free options!
Great Wine Selection and wonderful Cocktails
Service lacks speed but is friendly, hence go
when you are not in a rush! Make reservation for
Prime Time Dining, the place fills up!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Yesterday, our breakfast experience was the low point of our stay in Montecito. The dismissive wait staff and the manager overseeing a nearly empty room who couldn't be bothered to refill a coffee cup so eclipsed the food that we will never return. The food was decent, but the ""service"" earned our server a $2 tip."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Very sweet and quaint little Italian restaurant. It did remind me of Italy. The decor and the Italian speaking waiter!  This place is definitely full of locals. Probably a local favorite. They set us up at a table where we could sit next to each other as requested. So nice of them to accommodate.  We also brought our own bottle of wine which they charged a $30 corkage fee. A little higher then other restaurants in the area. The food was good. My bf ordered chicken masala. He enjoyed it very much. I ordered the fish special, halibut. It was just ok. A bit over cooked which made the fish taste dry. We followed by ordering two desserts:  affogato caffe and tiramisu. Both were very good."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Best tortelloni I've ever had! The cream walnut sauce was my pregnancy craving, if I could afford it I would eat it every night! Charming atmosphere, great for a special night out."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Went here on a weekday for breakfast. The quality was A1. You are eating breakfast in Montecito you shouldn't care about how much most things cost. I do but i was on a short get away with my wife. Breakfast was $60 after tip but one of the better right sized breakfast's I have had. This is not your beach bum $5 breakfast so don't expect it. The bananna's foster French toast was excellent and the coffee and oj were top notch. The only more expensive and more enjoyable breakfast has been at their sister restaurant ""Luckys"" down the street."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune is one of my fav restaurants in Santa Barbara/Montecito area. They always have wonderful Italian food (and are very accommodating). Also, I tried a new (to me) Italian white wine, Falanghina, which is lite and fruity!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I absolutely love this place. Despite the fancy table settings and moderately expensive food, it's the least pretentious despite being in Montecito. This is definitely not the place for a starving student, but certainly is if you want to feel like a million bucks. The food was amazing. Some of the best risotto I have had in a long long while. You'd think you were paying $30-$50 per plate at this plate, but really the prices are much lower than that. The staff was very attentive and fancy, which was nice for lunch. It was pretty quiet in there despite the large family at the table nearby. I guess the place would have to be packed and the tons of people out, say a weekend night, for it to be loud. But for lunch it was great. My step mom had their burger carbless and says its the best burger she's ever had. This is definitely a fancy restaurant, pricey for the rest of us lower-middle class folk, but you get that upper upper class feel for upper middle class price. So in terms of value vs. quality, they receive 5 stars for me. Cordial, attentive customer service. Very polite, responsive and quick service. Try the risotto with mozzarella and chicken, its amazing. The fetuchinne con mare e monti was also delish as well. So if you want to blow some money on absolutely yummo food and feel its more than worth it, come here. Best part - you can go casual too."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Food is good, manager is great, kitchen timing needs work.

3 of 5 dishes (2 lasagna, 2 ravioli and 1 chick fettuccine) came out then we waited 4 minutes for another lasagna and the capalini and meatball. The kitchen is that small they can't time the dishes to come out. Sure it's Italian, ""mangia mangia"", so you don't need to wait for others but the we usually do so food gets cold.

That said, the food was very good. I love to try the variety of lasagna in Santa Barbara. The largest portion, but not the best is from Arnoldi's Cafe, Trattoria Vittoria when it's done with lamb, is my favorite but a big round of applause for Tre Lune. The bechamel sauce was great and as mentioned, I'm a sucker for lamb ragu. This is the dish to beat.

While I'm disappointed at the delivery (minus one star), the food was very good (4 star). I'll ding them today but certainly return for more lasagna. You've won my heart over Trattoria, and that's hard to do."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,This is a great place for breakfast when you are visiting Montecito.  The Greek omelet is amazing. The Bloody Mary is perfect and the service is attentive and fast.  It is an elegant but casual place with cloth napkins on the tables and nice decorations.   I would recommend getting reservations for larger groups.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Went to brunch at this charming restaurant this past weekend. The service was a bit slow but still attentive and the food was delicious. I had the smoked salmon on toast with a side of roasted potatoes. 

The coffee was fresh and the restroom was clean, which is always a nice touch. Be certain to check out the photos on the walls as they're a taste of old Hollywood glamour! My friends mentioned that many of the celebrities who live in Montecito love to eat here as well."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Montecito is a small town. I mean it's not Perryville, Arkansas but a small town none the less. Elegant, ritzy, privileged, conservative might be words to describe this slightly hidden onclave.

So walking into Tre Lune restaurant it represented it's atypical demographic very nicely.....as it should.

The bar in the back makes generous strong drinks. Their wine list is well thought out. The service is very respectful and the food is real good. Pretty much everything I just mentioned is what a Montecito local would want and expect in their environment. 

My caesar salad was very good. My meatballs and spaghetti was great. My friends pasta bolognese was equally delicious. Our wives shared a branzino which they loved and our chosen Caberet was excellent. All done in a somewhat upper class, casual way. That might sound snooty, but it wasn't. I mean that in a good way.

Tre Lune was a very nice dinner, in this very nice small town, where there are very nice people."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Beautiful day, dined outside. Service was very good, but a little slow. We both ordered the Ellen Salad. A real winner! Shrimp, scallops and salmon cooked to perfection and served on a bed of sauteed arugula.

Highly recommend."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Great waiters and delicious food! Highly recommend Tre Lune for a family dinner, or a date. Really love the pictures all around the restaurant. Do wish the gelato serving size was bigger, but the tiramisu was nice and big. Great lasagna, family loved everything they ordered. Even the pesto they brought at the start was yummy (I'm not a fan of pesto, and this tasted different)."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Lovely late lunch at Tre Luna yesterday after a drive up from LA.  We started with the Ellen Salad which was comprised of expertly seared scallops, shrimp and a small salmon filet over greens.  We then moved on to the Risotto Lucca -- tomato, parmigiano and roast chicken.  Flavors were highly complimentary and the dish was perfectly seasoned even if the arborio was a smidge undercooked.  We actually ordered each dish to share but the kitchen split them for us and essentially doubled the orders.  Much appreciated!  Same for the enjoyable pinot grigio which we ordered by the glass but our server just kept pouring.  Since our plans to eat light were dead on arrival, we ordered the Affogato for dessert.  Also delicious.  Did I mention the expertly pulled espresso?  Noting too that service was impeccable.  Our server was right with us the whole meal -- highly accommodating but not at all obtrusive.  What a gem in tiny Montecito."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I came in towards the end of the lunch rush. It was great to people watch all of the locals. I tried their Ellen salad and it was heaven. Its an arugula salad with scallops, salmon and shrimp with a dijon vinaigrette. Simple salad, but when you are using great quality it really makes the difference. I have yet to find something similar in LA. I guess there is only 1 Ellen salad."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Little slice of heaven!  
It was a Wednesday afternoon and we got to splurge on fine dining at 11:45 in the afternoon!  Thankfully we got there early because it was PACKED by 12pm!
We ordered the Pepperoni Pizza and the Gnocchi Bolognese and split them both. I Had the Minestrone.  Fresh vegetables, a wonderful soup.  The pizza was probably the best I had ever had! I'm not kidding.  The Gnocchi could have used more meat sauce since it was so delicious.  
The crowd is on the ""Mature"" side but I can be mature...
Give me a couple of pearl necklaces and a fat diamond ring I'll fit right in.
Montecito crowd baby.  Then we were off to Lotusland!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The place is dark and noisy. Service is good but at Montecito pace, i.e. slow. The Greek omelette was totally bland due to lack of any seasoning. Potatoes tasted old but the bacon was good."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I have dined here many times, probably never on a Tuesday. The food was Bland and thoughtless.  I have had the pasta and fagioli many times, and never been so disappointed...hope you try harder next time."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Enjoyed lunch here yesterday.  I had the daily soup which was asparagus and it was sooooo good on a chilly day. Not too heavy, just right.  I also had the Ellen Salad which was very tasty. I loved the dijon dressing and the shellfish, but my piece of salmon was quite overcooked.  Service was friendly and I loved the Italian Cinema photos everywhere.  We will be back for dinner soon."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"My husband and I visited this place for the first time last weekend. I was in love with it the moment we entered. The restaurant is cozy and has a very classy decor. **Please make a reservation in advance** as this place fills up really fast. 

Our server was very helpful in suggesting dishes as we had no clue as to what we should order. 
Here's what we ordered :
1. Soup of the Day - a mushroom soup
2. Insalata Mista
3. Fusili Aristocratici
4. Salmone Al Limone E Capperi
5.Creme Brulee
6. Tiramisu

Everything listed up there was delicious. Do try their Tiramisu, I think it's the best I have ever tasted! 

The entire experience was very memorable. Each dish is carefully crafted. My taste buds definitely enjoyed the entire gastronomic delights!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Delicious! The best italian restaurant in town BY FAR! The most attentive service, authentic italian cuisine, and great atmosphere. I have spent a lot of time in Italy, and this is the one place in town that has properly cooked, perfectly flavored pastas, risottos, and yes, pizza!
It may be a little pricy, but it is definitely worth it!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune is fantastic Italian restaurant in the heart of Montecito. Their food is very good, and their staff is very friendly. Everything I've eaten here is fantastic -- from the soup to the salads to the pastas to the burger. Stop in if you're in town. You won't regret it.

TRY THE: Tre Lune Burger"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"My boyfriend and I are from LA and we were staying in Montecito for a couple of days for a nice little get away. We were recommended by a friend to have Tre Lune for dinner, so we went. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs while I ordered pasta with smoked salmon. I enjoyed my pasta while my boyfriend said his was okay. As he took his last bite, he said he felt like he was experiencing an allergic reaction. (He has a peanut allergy) we asked our server what his pasta was cooked in and he quickly brought the manager to us. The manager said that the pasta was cooked in canola oil, which I'm guessing my boyfriend is allergic to as well and he had no idea. My boyfriend felt dizzy and went to the bathroom. The manager and other employees were very nice and helpful about the situation. But, they brought out the check and his spaghetti was still on the bill.. I don't know how I feel about that. I understand that it's not their fault for not knowing he has this allergy but come on.. Where is your heart? He was so sick.. I walked him back to our place, literally holding him up the whole way. As we got home he was vommiting and could not breathe. I ended up taking him to the hospital where they shot an epi pen in him and hooked him up to the IV. We were at the hospital for 4 hours. If you have any food allergies, I guess be careful. I also find it strange that they cook their pasta in canola oil? Canola oil is a very cheap oil to use but I still managed to spend $60 for two plates of pasta."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Praying for our friends at Tre Luna, our favorite restaurant in Montecito. We come here many times when visiting the Four Seasons every summer. Please be okay...we love you!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The only reason why the rating isn't lower is that dinner (in person) at Tre Lune can be a really nice experience. The service and food quality can be top notch.

Ordering take out is another experience altogether.

Sure ordering for pickup automatically excludes us from getting a level of service that is often expected from a Montecito restaurant but we didn't realize that ordering takeout also meant that we would be subject to huge swings of food quality/consistency. After all isn't food quality the one thing that a restaurant can exhibit huge amounts of control over?

The latest takeout experience involved ordering Garganelli with chicken and mushrooms. One order excluded the chicken and the other order assumed that we would enjoy having the chicken added as an after thought - on top of the dish as if it were an over easy egg. We have pictures of the incredibly appetizing meal (being facetious of course) but there doesn't appear to be a way to post those while writing this review. Keep in mind the cost of the meal is the same for takeout or dine in.  The same price applies even when no chicken or mushrooms are added.

Our advice - don't order takeout at Tre Lune.  If you are in pinch and find yourself looking over the menu, then place your order and clear your calendar just in case you need to stick around the restaurant while your dish is being remade the correct way.

PS. And no, these are not the only examples.  There are others but clearly we didn't learn our lesson and continued ordering.  The last experience may have sealed the deal for a long while."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I came here for brunch on my birthday. I enjoyed the rose breakfast. The olive spread was light but flavorful and paired well with the poached eggs. The service was great. We sat outside because the inside seemed very dark and stuffy. I enjoyed the food, but wouldn't want to dine inside."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,We were looking forward to a nice dinner at Tre Lune for our Anniversary. Unfortunately we were very disappointed. Our waitperson was very cold and abrupt with our service. There was simply zero interaction. If this was a diner I would overlook this but not a restaurant serving a community such as Montecito.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We had an overall good experience! The waiter was very knowledgeable of the foods and wines. Venue is small and intimate, not noisy at all. We had a RSVP, and got seated right away. We would come back again!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Lovely Italian restaurant with delicious food. Our service was excellent. Great prices in an upscale area. We went dressed casual, but dressy would work as well."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Cheese Omelette: $12.00 (MAYBE two eggs and THREE SMALL ""complimentary""* potatoes)
Orange Juice: $5.00
Side of Avocado: $5.00
Eat in the Land of Oprah: PRICELESS

If you want to hear men with small penises talk about their helicopters with their Mistresses, then this is the spot! If you'd like a worthwhile, affordable meal, go elsewhere. 

* When I asked the very nice waitress if they meant to give me three potatoes, she said they were ""complementary."" LOL."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,So glad to see that you have reopened after the fire and mudslides. We love this restaurant and come every summer many times when we stay at the Biltmore. Wonderful Italian food. Whatever we have ordered we love. Can't wait to come back this summer.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We enjoyed a delicious meal here for a special occasion. The service was good, and all of the food was very fresh. And to me, the fact that there seemed to be mostly ""locals"" there was a true testament to how good this place really is. We even had a celebrity sighting! This is definitely an authentic neighborhood gem."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"In a town (Montacito) known for its arrogance and in hospitability, this is one of the only restaurants that tries to be responsive.  We got the veal piccata ($28) and the chicken cannelloni ($20), however in most of the Italian restaurants in the world, they give pasta with expensive veal, not steam table vegetables. They were accommodating but charged $8 for 65 cents of spaghetti (a child's portion) and never credited us for the veggies; that's greedy. Hence they lost a star."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Great customer service!! Friendly staff!! veggie pastas are my favorite in this place and lots of desserts options in the menu
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The food is good for Santa Barbara, mediocre at best for LA, but the service is seriously lacking.  I have been coming to this restaurant for years, due in large part to the sheer lack of dining options in this town, and have noticed a steady decline in the service. Given the restaurant's outrageous prices, the consistently rude, condescending, and apathetic staff is entirely atrocious and unacceptable. For instance, last night I made a specific request when ordering for the chef not to include a particular ingredient in my meal because of a food allergy. Lo and behold, my food came out and of course had the ingredient I had begged them not to put in it. Rather than apologizing for the mistake, the rude blonde waitress looked at me as if it were my fault and said, ""well I made a note but they include it in the sauce so next time you should specify."" She went on to defend her mistake in a very condescending manner. 

  Bottom Line:
Horrendous service, mediocre food, and outrageous prices and it's only getting worse. 

Santa Barbara needs more choices stat."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"From the stale bread and burnt breadsticks in the bread basket, to the lackluster cioppino, to the burnt tasting & room-temperature-obviously-not-decaf-or-why-am-I-still-awake-at-3:30am-coffee, to the server who spent more time checking out his tips from other tables and obviously trying to upsell and pander for a bigger tip than providing actual service, to the LOUD interior, to the ""mousse"" that was so thick and heavy that it was practically pudding, this restaurant only earned a couple of stars for two reasons. The cioppino had very good seafood (scallops!) and the tiramisu was light, delicate, and the perfect amount of sweetness.  However, the flavor of the cioppino at Brophy Brothers is far superior. Don't waste your time here - dinner took 2  1/2 hours, or your money. If you're in the mood for Italian, go to Olio e Limone or Ca Dario."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We had a wonderful lunch for the group of five of us. Several in our party had been here multiple times, though it was our first. Good service, excellent food, and a beautiful area will bring us back again."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Brevity, truly, is the heart of wit, and at the heart of the ""where should we go to eat tonight?"" the answer that will keep you coming home smiling is TRE LUNE. This ""3 Moons"" dining experience is over the moon not because it is so over the moon expensive but because it is so dependably great. And the staff, ALL, are great. You are taken care of, the food seriously good, and the experience is half NY and half Italia all in Montecito. Great work over time. TRE LUNE, take a bow!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I really want to give this place a million stars. But, the pizza was decent and the fettuccine Alfredo was okay (the chicken was dry and the sauce had just a bit of flavor). However, the delivery person was so kind and the service was wonderful. It was an okay place to grab an early evening delivery meal after not wanting to leave my hotel room."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Good food.  Terrible service.  Throughout the entire meal, the waitress we had made it feel as if she was doing us a favor by waiting on us.   She spent the whole time chatting it up in the back with the manager and other wait staff.  The most attention she gave us was when she delivered the check,  of course.  Can't stand those type of servers.  Get it together Tre Luna!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"In contrast to the experience of some other reviewers, we found the service to be excellent. The manager or maître de was very attentive but not overbearing. We sat at the bar and had an excellent meal (tre lune salad, veal Parmesan, fettuccine Alfredo). Good, classic Italian with good cocktails and good Italian and Cali wine selections."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We went there after spending an afternoon at Lotusland. The setting is great, small and intimate inside the restaurant. The waiters are very attentive and the food was delicious. We would return here for sure. The prices are as one would expect in Montecito."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I was given a gift certificate to have dinner here with my husband.  A nice neighborhood restaurant with intimate but low key atmosphere.  Convenient location in the heart of Montecito.  Authentic Italian, great Italian wines - not too expensive.  Delicious pasta."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,We ate there last night. The food was great but our waiter was TERRIBLE and RUDE. I'd love to give this restaurant a higher score but the service from the waiter specifically was so bad it left us shaking our heads. It really doesn't matter how good the food at a restaurant is if the wait staff makes you never want to return.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I've been to Tre Lune a handful of times and the food never disappoints. I love digging into the Antipasto della casa with a glass of wine and calling it dinner.
The waitstaff have been attentive and are knowledgeable. They can answer in -depth  questions about wine by the glass for which I am grateful.
The downsides aren't insurmountable but I gotta list them.

1. That's Not Really Bar Seating. The bar is a short narrow affair in the back that is employed as a waitstaff station. Their computer is there, the service bar is there, waiters get glasses from there. You, Customer, are In The Way. Pardon the elbow in the face.

2. The regulars are full of themselves. I had the misfortune of sitting next to some Post Theater people who loved to belt out impromptu tunes which ruined my appetite. Didn't realize I signed up for dinner theater. Eeek.

3. Spendy but what else do you expect?"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,I know they have a good cappuccino:) waffles not sure I like them the best but nice presentation... Breakfast is always good so I'll be back for trying other stuff. Menu sounds delicious!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"My husband and I were in Santa Barbara for our anniversary and we searched around for nice romantic restaurants to eat at. We found Tre Lune had good reviews and had a good menu. We made reservations on a Thursday evening at 8pm. 

1) good thing we made reservations because the place was packed inside & outside

2) it's a very small restaurant, maybe 15 or so tables inside & a few outside. It did have a nice ambience to it though. It could be a tad loud for people who are seated in the middle of the restaurant--alot of conversations are going on amongst the patrons. We lucked out with a corner table in the back. 

3) the menu has good options that should please most people (we're picky eaters so EXTREME fine dining--duck liver, octopus etc-is not our cup of tea). 

4) a bottle of riesling is $48 & the entrees were anywhere from the $24-49 range. The prices on their website are outdated--most everything was a couple dollars extra at the restauraunt.

5) our waitress (blond, middle-aged woman) was very friendly and attentive--until she left halfway in between our dining experience! She brought us the bottle of wine & took our order, & that was the last we saw of her! 

After about 30 minutes, our food was dropped off (i had the garganelli alla calabrese--penne w/ spicy sausage, which was pretty good & my husband had the Grigliata Mista di Pesce which is a seafood mix--the scallops were the BEST!). 
We finished our food without anyone coming up to us (we didn't know for sure our server had left yet, we just knew we hadn't seen her for awhile--we assumed she was on break). We finished our bottle of wine & would have loved more drinks. Our food was finally cleared from our table by a busser. 

However, no server was coming up to us--no actual server came to us at all for a good 30 minutes, since taking our food order. After about 10 more minutes & with the restaurant half-cleared out, my husband flagged down another waiter, asking for a dessert menu. He said sure and retrieved one for us immediately. A few more minutes went by, and, again, no server came up to us. My husband flagged down the same server who got us the dessert menu and asked if we could order from him, since we hadn't seen our server. My husband asked what happened to her. The poor waiter seemed very nervous saying that she went home and he seemed annoyed (but not towards us!) that she didn't say anything! He was completely taken aback that the waitress had just abandoned us and went home. He took our dessert order and i ordered an after-dinner drink. 

We finished up the night with him & paid out with him. It appeared he might have discussed our plight (& our original server's faux pas) with a manager, but no one ever came over to our table to address the issue or attempt to make our very expensive, very meaningful night out a little better. My husband & I generally don't like to complain unless something truly awful happened, and, granted, being abandoned by our server in a very nice restaurant, isn't a very classy thing to have happen; but we didn't complain that night. So, that was our fault, but still a forewarning to people who go there. 

Nice restaurant, with big prices & a questionable waitress working for them."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,I had the best experience yet because of the service from Francisco. Not only was the food he suggested amazing but he also had a great taste for wine. He also shares a warming smile & was extremely attentive.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We went out for brunch on Sunday morning looking forward to a stellar omelet.  We arrived and there were only two other tables occupied.  The restaurant got busier and we observed 4 other tables had received food when they had arrived at least 10 to 15 minutes after us.  When we finally got the server's attention, we asked about our food.  He told us that they were experiencing a rush.  We reminded him that we had arrived well before said rush.  He said he would check on our order and eventually came back with more coffee informing us our food was on its way.  Much later, still no food and we asked a different server who was also going to check into it.  We finally left after a 45 minute wait with no food or explanation for the deplorable lack of service.  We have patronized this restaurant in the past experiencing reasonable food quality and variable service with a side of arrogance.  Arrogance is never palatable, especially when the service is poor.  We will not return - zero service, zero food and zero stars."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"As a Montecito resident for the past 15 years this restaurant is a staple in the community.  It's always packed and if you are a regular you always feel like you are eating at a friends home as the staff treats you as such.. Last time I ate here I had a half order of the lobster pasta to start followed by the Dover Sole special.  Probably the best meal I have had since I started eating here.  Why the negative stars.. My family doesn't dine here enough to be considered a regular, so the staff can be a little snooty.  I've dined here a couple of times with friends in my 20's and 30's and I have found that the staff looks down on us because of our age.  Only after realizing we are spending hundreds of dollars on our meal did their attitude change.  I've also had meals that were good not great.. The flavors just didn't work at times.. Finally the prices for their pastas are exorbitant for the quality of the food.  It took 15 years for my palate to be blown away.  But now I know what to order there.  So overall a win. I just wish the servers were a little nicer.  I've never had any attitude issues at Lucks steakhouse which is their sister restaurant so I'm not sure how two restaurants with the same owner could have such different temperaments."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Followed great recommendations and went for light lunch.  Thirty minutes for Minestrone seems a little long, but when the only relevant comparison is to Campbells one wonders about the recommendations, only saved by adding the pesto they served with the bread.  Perhaps a bad day, everything else was fine if even if not remarkable."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We received a recommendation from a friend-of-a-friend who lives in the area to come here, and we're so glad we did.  Had an outstanding family dinner.  Every single thing we ordered was delicious (we tasted everything around the table): soups, salad, pasta, chicken, wine, and desserts. Our server Ortega was attentive, helpful, and pleasant.  Best meal of our visit to the area."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Every time I come here, it's a treat. I usually come for breakfast and it's never a let down. I order their omelettes frequently and they're always great. 
They have a great selection of teas.. including blossoming tea which is really neat! They always have fresh rose buds on each table and customer service is always wonderful. I'd recommend this place for anyone who happens to be near by.. whether you're a local or just passing through."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,We wandered in to this place for lunch and were surprised how good it was.   Great bistro atmosphere and the best profiteroles I've had stateside!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Il vero italiano! Fantastic service and authentic food. My favorite Italian in Santa Barbara. Pasta is made to perfection. Carpaccio is my favorite and the pizzas too. Who knows one day I might have a cute tiny chair with my name...just kidding.
Love the ambiance of old world and famous charm. 
The outdoor tables are also special. Is cozy and chic. Don't forget to check their specials."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Excellent excellent excellent! The service was on hit and the food was straight perfection! I ordered the fettuccine aiporcini tartufata it was excellent! My husband had the veal scalopini! Delicious!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I don't get it. It's OAP (old and putrid), the servers are nice but certainly not knowledgeable, and the food is not good. It's expensive too.
So I spent $200 on a lousy ""meal"" (good wine though I will give credit) & left a heavy Italian American stress on the latter - feeling hungry? 
I had horrible ravioli that I literally could not eat. The carpaccio was not impressive. Pretty much best part was the bread and the wine...headache approaching I'm sure."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Went here for a Sunday breakfast while just visiting.  I had just been walking, looking at menus when I stumbled in.  The wait staff was very courteous and they all asked if I had been helped.  Wasn't sure if that was just the way the service was or if no one knew whose section I belonged to.  Either way, I thought it was delightful.

The frittata was _amazing_!  For about $13 (plus $2.50 for avocado) it was a tad pricey, but fairly worth it.  

My only issue, other than the price, was that the receptionist was bored and kept staring at everyone, which was making me a bit uncomfortable.  Plus, what seemed to be the manager was doing about the same thing.  Standing in the front, hands on the hips, overseeing everything and not helping _at all_.  Oh well.  I guess that's why he gets the big bucks?"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Amazing fusilli with artichokes and truffle oil, service outstanding but perhaps a bit heavy handed on rushing when there's no need to rush. Great recommends for dining and wine. Fantastic Montecito setting"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"While the service was excellent, the wine selection comprehensive, the food was mediocre at best. One would expect more from a Montecito location. The salt in the sauces overwhelmed the herbs in both the fish and veal dishes we had. While a certain degree of bitterness is pleasant, the Tre Lune salad was overcome by the bitter Radicchio. For the price, we will find other options next time."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune is a very fine property - all aspects - gourmet dishes are amazing, overall the staff does a great job, the ambience is wonderful, and they open at 7:30 AM for breakfast.  All 3 of us were extremely happy with our dining experience.  From the egg dishes we had, which were perfectly cooked to the potatoes to the fruit bowl (not a cup) with bite-size pieces of fresh, yes fresh, fruit (so many times restaurants serve old fruit, yuck).  You need to put this place on your Bucket List and it is just off the 101 in Montecito.  I'm saving the 5 star review for when we have dinner there which we are looking forward to."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Every time my husband and I come here, we are treated so well! This last time was right after spending all day at the Solstice Festival, him with his face painted across his eyes and nose and me wearing beach clothing, which is not what most people in Montecito would be caught dead in for dinner. 

The hostess was extremely sweet, and as it was so busy, she asked if we would like to wait or enjoy the bar. We chose the bar at the back of the restaurant and were treated like a million bucks by Bartender Chris and Chef Cesar. Chef asked us what we had ordered and said, ""Are you sure you want to eat that?"" I just looked at him and said, ""You're the professional, what should I be eating?"" He simply said, ""Lemme take care of you guys. You want 2 or 3 courses,"" and then told me I was wrong for picking 2. After that, I just let him tell me what to eat. 

Chef started us with the Antipasto Della Casa, and everything was just perfect. He even put olive oil on the sliced meat, just like my dad does. Everything was spectacular! For seconds, we had a small, and filling, plate of Fettucine with Black Truffle. Holy hell it was amazing! The pasta was absolutely perfectly al dente. We sat there in silence as we ate, just reveling in the pure deliciousness. For our final course, he made us the Margo with a white fish (it was one thing we had originally ordered). Everything about it was divine. 

And because dessert really should count as its own thing, he finished us off with a chocolate mousse that was so light and fluffy. Throughout the entire meal, Chef and Bartender Chris constantly checked on us to make sure we were doing well and happy. At the end of the evening, I thanked Manager Chris for having such excellent staff and thanking him for taking care of us, even if we looked a little different than the normal Montecito crowd. 

I highly recommend going here and enjoying everything!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"This is a good place to go for breakfast - there are several tasty dishes to give a go here, like the Rose (poached eggs on toast with artichoke spread) and the Foster's Banana French Toast (rum-something with lots of sugary delights). I think they might be connected to D'Angelo's Bakery but I'm only going on a guess since they serve similar dishes and offer the bakery's pastries. I went with the French Toast and strawberries and was totally satisfied. The cappuccino is good here too, which is a major plus. Don't leave without trying their preserves even if you didn't order a bread product - they make them in house and they are really yummy!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"This rating is strictly because of our server.
It's a shame because the food was good. Our waitress for the evening was having a tough time attaching a smile to her face and her attitude towards our table and to the kitchen was unprofessional. If you don't like where you work or what you are doing then find somewhere else. Please. 
Our friends had been here multiple times and were shocked at her demeanor.
The food was good - but pricey. It was a special occasion so we gave it a shot. I'm not anticipating we'll be running back anytime soon."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I had the worst lunch here ever. The service was slow and barely there, even though the place was practically empty. When it finally did arrive, there was a huge metal spring, or some kind of wire in my pizza that I only noticed when I bit down already. The manager was pretty rude and dismissive over it, which bothered me the most. I've worked in customer service before, and you just don't act that way after possibly injuring them."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Food was decent, nothing great, but you will not be too disappointed.
The reason for the lower rating is because of our very snobby waitress. Sure we were college students, but considering we were the only customers at the place, she could've dialled down the attitude.
The place is nice, has a great ambience and the price is low. Try it out, hopefully u'll get a waitress with no attitude problems."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Best Italian Restaurant in Montecito/Santa Barbara!!! Food, service atmosphere!! Great always, brunch, lunch and dinner!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Went to Tre Lune for breakfast on a Tuesday at the recommendation of a local art dealer. I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. We chose a table inside. There was a lot of attention to detail in decor, branded plates, crisp linens, etc. though they missed some dusting at the rail around the room. The waiter was super slow and acted like he hated his job. But the food was great. And was a good value. I had an omelet with sausage, mushroom and onion with potatoes, olive bread, bacon and a fresh squeezed orange juice. My friend had the egg sandwich. We both enjoyed the food. I'd go back with the hopes that I got a better waiter."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I am always fond of dinning at Tre Lune the food is excellent and service,usually good...


My guest and I arrived at 11:45 am Sat. And informed the servers we would like breakfast and we were waiting for four others,
Party of six.

The servers informed me that we would not be able to dine for breakfast... That we would have to choose from the lunch menu.
seeing only three tables occupied and being that it was before noon on a sat. We were quite disappointed.

The six of us had a fabulous breakfast at Jeannine's down the street."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The food was really quite underwhelming, and the service was a bit pretentious but good.  I had a seafood risotto special, and the fish was overcooked and the calamari was tough.  My fellow diners had pasta dishes, but weren't raving about them.  The homemade grissini were the hit of the night.  Plus, I've never seen an olive used as a garnish in an Aperol spritz before (yikes)!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Good place... I read that ""Tre Lune"" is ""three moons."" There is a famous and old poems for toast in Korea. Translate it: There are three moons here. One is in the sky, Another is in the sea, The other is in your glass. Cheers! This place lacks of the second moon in the sea."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"My party of six was there last night to celebrate my daughters graduation. Food was good, however the service was awful. We were there for an hour and a half. We were totally neglected by our server. We had to ask multiple times for water refills. 

Also, they have too many tables packed in that room. You are literally about two feet from the next table. It was very loud, I felt like I was in a bar. Won't be back."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I used to love this place! What happened? The past 6 months, my food has been medicore and the service has been poor. The fish is undercooked, the lamb is overcooked. The plates are way too hot (as an attempt to keep food that's been sitting around warm) My guest burned her hand and needed ice(!) and they didn't even offer to comp anything. The mozarella and iced tea is very good but for the price, I expect more professionalism and service."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Italian is virtually all I eat, and I've been on the hunt for the best Italian restaurant in the Santa Barbara area for a few weeks. I'm happy to say I think I've found it! Everything I ate here was excellent: the assorted bread basket, the meat lasagna, and the cannelloni al forno.

I originally ordered just the lasagna, but I decided to add on the cannelloni and take half of each home. (It didn't hurt that my employer was footing the bill.)

Meat lasagna: has a good meat: cheese: sauce ratio; uses the good cheeses (mozzarella was at the forefront and I didn't taste any ricotta, which I don't care for); and not an overwhelming tomato flavor like you get with some lasagna. I'm usually not a big fan of lamb, and I still would say I prefer beef lasagna, but this is the best lamb lasagna I've had. I will order this again.

Cannelloni al forno: I'm so glad I added this on--this turned out to be one of my favorite Italian dishes of all time! At first glance, it looks like a heap of soppy noodles with not much going on, but don't let this fool you. Delicious combination of only the good cheeses (like mozzarella) with chicken and a few complementary veggies wrapped in fresh pasta and covered in a delicious cheese sauce. The sauce was my favorite part, but I wouldn't call it a tomato sauce. It's a pink sauce more similar to alfredo than to tomato sauce, but it's not creamy and heavy like alfredo. I will definitely order this again too.

Overall, fantastic food that is well worth the price! The servers were friendly, and the place has a vibe that is very classy but still homey."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Great location next to a bunch of shops! Quick service and the outdoor tables were perfect for the weather. 

I was only able to get a drink. The mocha was great and came out quickly."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune has become much more consistent over the years and we now enjoy it weekly.  Service can be pot luck, however there is a new waitress who is the best they've had in years.  Ask for Frieda when you make a reservation.  The farfale al salmon is always great and the chicken is also usually excellent.  Fish can be good or bad, depending on the night."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Muy buen ambiente, rico, servicio excelente! Sobre todo la mesa que nos toco en la vereda... Eramos 4 con 6 niños, como nos miraban los que llegaban después! Pero realmente muy bueno, un chardonnay de Carneros y un pinot noir de Sonoma."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Although I don't go there often I really love Tre Lune!  It is so adorable with the white table cloths and all of the tiny little chairs that circle the the room, each an honor to a special regular who is lucky  enough to frequent this great little restaurant.

I guess you would call it an Italian place based on the menu but I have only been once for dinner.   Breakfast time it is waffles, pancakes and Eggs Benedict.   Everything I have had there is delicious and the portions are big, don't think I have ever finished an entire meal.  

I love the Eggs Benedict and have had the omelette which was delish.  Once I splurged and had a Bloody Mary with my breakfast but I usually just have the delicious cappuccino.  

What is really great though is that you are at the most beautiful restaurant with most delicious food, sitting in a room with all of the movers and shakers of Santa Barbara eating an omelette for the same $13 that you would probably pay at Esau's.    I do think the $7 bagel and cream  cheese is a little steep though but I guess they have to keep out the riff-raff."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I have breakfast meetings here all the time. Great service, good food. Love the breakfast sandwich. Good for lunch as well (although I feel out of place with all the big wigs around me.)"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune was absolutely amazing. My family and I stopped at the Montecito Inn for a night on our way down to San Diego from the Bay Area. Upon recommendation, we decided to check this place out because it was conveniently located in walking distance from our hotel. We arrived at the restaurant and they had a table set up inside in the corner, but it was the middle of a nice summer heat wave so we asked if we could sit outside. They were more than happy to oblige. We were greeted promptly with menus, water, and delicious bread. It took a few minutes for our actual server to show up, but it was well worth the wait because our server, Luis, was wonderful.
My boyfriend, dad, and I are all huge fans of CA Chardonnays, so we were a little weary of the wine list seeing as they were almost all Italian wines by the bottle. Luis steered us toward this gem: 2009 ""LA PIETRA"" Cabreo, Toscana. Amazing. We finished the bottle and then went on to order another glass each.
Sometimes I find Italian menus overwhelming, but Luis made it so easy with great recommendations and explanations of any menu items we were contemplating. I ordered the Girgliata Mista di Pesce and it was well worth the price. Everything was cooked to perfection and I got a delicious bite of all the seafood I could have wanted. Dad ordered their special, which was a simple white fish done in a lemon caper butter. His was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and his was a close second to my dish. Boyfriend ordered a pizza and loved it. Mom and brother both ordered pastas and cleared their entire plates.
Stayed for dessert and did the dessert pizza (a must!) and Affogato.
All in all, it was a wonderful meal, but it was the entire experience that made it a real stand-out for us. Attentive wait staff, great management, and wonderful food and wine. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Montecito! Better yet, we might just make Montecito a new destination spot as long as we get to go to Tre Lune!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"4.5 stars because although I absolutely adored this place and the food was amazing, it was SO loud!!! The food quality, portions and service were all great. We didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night but we only had to wait at the bar for about 10 minutes before we were seated. Everything we ordered was first rate... and being greedy, I tried some of everyone's food. For appetizers, the pasta e fagioli soup was delicious as was the burrata alla caprese and the bruschetta. I absolutely loved the salmon farfalle and the gnocci so light and delicious and was cooked perfectly. The tiramisu and cannoli were also delicious for dessert! I will absolutely return here next time I'm in the Santa Barbara area. Truly a hidden little gem!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"A+ pasta, decent service. If you aren't a regular, they may make you feel second-class. I went in the other day and asked for a table along the wall and they said it was reserved so I got seated in the middle of the room. I doubt people people are reserving ""wall seats"" and gave me the other table because I was an unfamiliar face. That said, the food is really good. A lot of pasta selections that are all awesome. The clientele is a little bit Montecito snooty, a lot of ladies who lunch and older couples - but if you're ok with that (and if you aren't, why are you in Montecito?) you'll probably like this place!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Favorite Italian restaurant in town 
The food is always amazing. We have never been disappointed once. 
The chef and the staff are so nice 
It's super close to my house so I come here often"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employee. I realize that the majority of people that have reviewed this restaurant love it. Therefore I only wish to report our experience. Like the one person in the crowd all of whom where  cheering the emperor, we only,realized he had no clothes. I ordered a 12 dollar glass of La Spinetta sparkling Rose.  I am familiar with the wines from this producer and they are all excellent. Our server brought the order not in a flute but in white wine glass. I saw one bubble rise to the top of the glass. Clearly this was tired sparkling wine and should have never been served. My server had no clue that this was improper. I ordered the frittura mista, Fritto Misto to the cognoscenti. An inferior imitation of this classic Italian dish! The fried crust on the seafood more reminiscent of Coney Island than the Amalfi Coast. I console myself that it was lunch not dinner and although we did not sample other things on the menu why bother!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I thought Tre Lune was a nice restaurant with very good pizzas. I liked the black and white photos of 50's stars on the walls. The pizzas seemed to be Sicilian style with a thin crust. What we tried were the San Daniele with Italian prosciutto and arugula, and the Capricciosa, with artichokes, mushrooms, ham, and black olives. Both were delectable. I preferred the San Daniele as the Capricciosa was on the salty side. 

Our waitress brought out chili oil for our pizzas. The oil provided a nice kick. The service here was nice and we found our lunch to be a pleasant and delicious experience. I'd like to try more items on their menu; there's a good variety offered.
The option to order takeout online is available at www.menuclub.com/trelune."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Wow!! What the heck happened? I came with a friend to Tre Lune about a year and half ago and had a marvelous dinner at the bar. It was a completely different experience this time around. Cocktails took forever and were definitely not up to par. Food took even longer and the chicken dish I ordered was overcooked and dry. The server was never around when we needed anything until it was time for the (exorbitant) bill. Overall, Tre Lune seemed to be a completely different restaurant. The price was high last time, but the dining experience was grand!! This time around, the price was high and the experience was LOW! Probably won't be coming back..."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We came to Tre Lun last weekend for dinner as our hotel highly recommended it. I really enjoyed the setting as the restaurant is filled with photos of classic Hollywood stars, tiny chairs that symbolize that their loyal costumers always have a chair at the restaurant. Our waiter was wonderful- i didn't catch his name but he was very friendly, helpful with the menu and very attentive to us. They brought us a bread basket with home made spinach pesto which was very good and unique. My boyfriend and I shared a spinach salad that had egg, bacon, cheese in it. It was delicious! For my main dish I got a procuitto pizza with arugula which was great. They gave us this spicy olive oil to put on top of the pizza which definitely gave it an extra kick. I usually dont like red peppers and spices but their spicy oil was the perfect hint of spice. My boyfriend got the meat calzone which was huge and very tasty. He enjoyed his meal. For dessert we got the gelato with cappuccino on top of it. We really enjoyed our meal and the service that was provided. We would definitely come back and I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family traveling to Montecito."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"One of the most extensive and impressive Italian wine lists I have ever seen.  Food and service were good.  My only grip was the price, but hey it is Montecito..."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Excellent Italian dinner at Tre Lune in Montecito.  I had the Ossobuco with Saffron Risotto and a creamy Tiramisu for dessert.  A lovely Syrah was the perfect accompaniment.  My dining companion had Chilean sea bass and an Affogato, which he enjoyed.  You definitely want a reservation here, as it's a hot ticket even on a Monday night.  Nice quiet atmosphere, except for my loud ass, of course.  I definitely recommend Tre Lune for all who love quality Italian cuisine."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Everytime we have given this place one last chance, we have had the worst service ever. It does not matter if we sit inside, outside, are there for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We wait 10 minutes for a menu, 15 to place a drink order, 25 to place our food order and 45 to be served. God forbid we should ask for more water.....they never bring it! Then we wait 15 mins for the check and finally walk to the back to get the credit card slip because we waited another 20 mins and no slip. The food is always bad. Last time I went my friend ordered a salad with artichoke. It looked like they took old shavings from cleaning artichokes and threw them it. They were brown and hard. I gathered them up to show the kitchen. They did not charge us. Unfortunately this cute little restaurant will never have another chance from me."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I brought my husband here for a birthday dinner as he was craving authentic italian and there isn't much in Ventura that's worth a special trip.   The service was great, the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu choices and the drink menu, and helped guide my very indecisive husband to a dinner he throughly enjoyed when he was torn between two dishes (usually the case, he always orders last!)  Carpaccio, cesar salads, osso bucco and lasagne, all the hallmarks of a good traditional italian restaurant and each was wonderful.     Lovely atmosphere, the wait staff was attentive without being intrusive, lovely meal all in all.  We're fans and will be back to try all the other items on the menu that we couldn't in one sitting!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Have had breakfast lunch and dinner there. All were excellent. The big surprise was breakfast, it beats the local completion. Obviously a favorite of the locals despite the slightly higher cost, but well worth it."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,We made last minute reservations for Valentine's Day and lucky we did!  The restaurant was packed.  Our service from Rafael was all time fantastic.  Don't miss out on the appetizers - we shared three at the table - with the salmon w/limone & capers was out of this world!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Simply some of the best Italian I have had in awhile! My fiancé, son and I went in for lunch the service was fast, helpful and they left you alone enough making the experience calm and enjoyable. Everything from the bread to the olive oil and vinegar to both our dishes were so flavorful and well presented I was so pleasantly surprised. Since going there our first time we have returned and have been met with repeat great service and food. I went on my birthday with some friends and they did not have a special i loved in the past, which was a pounded veal steak with aged ham and cheese and a side of veggies, i asked if they could make it and they said it wasn't an issue! 
give it a try you wont be disappointed!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"On balance, Tre Lune is a reliable Italian dining option in the heart of the Montecito village located on Village Coast Road. The deco is tasteful but devoid of any true intimacy as the only option is open table seating in the dining room. The menu is quite extensive and the sampled entrees to date all pay reasonable tribute to their Italian origins. The wine list is complete but lacks a selection of moderately priced table wines for those with pedestrian tastes and pocketbooks. Service can be a little spotty when busy. Dinner for two with entrees, a bottle of wine and tip about $120 out the door."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune is a very quiet and well appointed eatery in Montecito on Coast Village Road. I had a group of five for breakfast. The service was good and the food was slightly above average. I had eggs Benedict at a price point of $18 and a couple in our party had bananas foster French toast which was stated to be ok but that you could taste too much rum. We had a snafu when paying out as our server double charged when we were trying to payout. That took a while to correct. All in all, pretty decent, and a nice setting."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Staying at Montecito Inn and they recommended for Italian food. Monday evening ; no wait. Ordered mushroom soup...okay. Entree was margherita pizza and chicken limone. The chicken was EXCELLENT so tasty. Bread assortment they brought to table was delicious. I would go back quite a menu assortment.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,Great serv nice space.When full a bit crowded. Excellent spagh and lentils pasta special. My strip steak good but not tops and bit bland and with some gristle.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"If there was a restaurant that perfectly captured the dolce far niente - sweetness of doing nothing - Tre Lune would be it. The small, intimate bistro strikes notes of romantic sophistication, infused with the warmth and family-style atmosphere that makes Italian cuisine so comforting. The food is delicate, fresh and flavorful, just as you'd hope and the service was lovely. Our waiter never rushed us, offered recommendations, and ensured that each course was an experience rather than a chore. It makes for a perfect date night - complete with candlelit terrace seating, an extensive Italian wine menu, and fare meant to share. Tre Lune far outshines it's celebrated neighbor, Trattoria Mollie (which gets weighed down by snobish staff, despite the fabulous kitchen team). If you're looking for high-end Italian in Santa Barbara, Tre Lune gets my vote for charm and taste."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I used to really look forward to coming here but I'm not sure we will return after last night. I've noticed a trend in restaurants that after asking what type of water you want they bring it and then vanish for 15 minutes - giving the illusion of service but not really delivering. Sadly, this type of non-service has permeated Tre Lune. By the time we received our second drink all of our plates had been cleared and we were being given dessert menus.

I wish I could say that the food was so exceptional that I didn't mind the iffy service. But if you order a pizza Diabala with 3 ingredients (spicy sausage, chili pepper and onions) it means you want flavor and heat. What arrived was non-spicy sausage, four onion slices and zero chile peppers. When I pointed this out I was brought chile flakes in a shaker. When I referred to the menu I was brought out some chopped chilis from a jar that were so briny and salty they were pretty much inedible. 

All said, food + service + price = really disappointing."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Best coffee in Montecito. Best Steak and eggs. Best bread selection. Best service. Best decor. Best photographs. Best restroom.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"My friend and I decided to try Tre Lune for dinner on a stop up the California coast. It was a busy (and noisy) Saturday evening and -- as we didn't have a reservation -- we were not able to get a table. We opted to sit at the bar and it turned out to be a wonderful experience. We shared a mushroom pizza and a perfectly grilled seafood salad. The bartender was an absolute delight ... very attentive and funny even though he was clearly very busy! He poured us some very potent martinis and a couple of tasty glasses of wine. We ended up staying until the restaurant was almost empty, just chatting and enjoying the atmosphere. Definitely coming back and reserving a table, although it was kind of fun having dinner at the bar!! Only drawback was the bill... a bit pricey. But it is Montecito, I guess."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I now work down the street from Tre Lune and my managers brought me here for lunch.  We each ordered one of the pizzas and they were really good.  

I can't remember the name of the one that i ordered, but from the description it sounded slightly strange with broccoli on it so i was a little worried, but when it came out, it was delicious!  

we went for lunch, so not sure about the brunch menu that the other yelpers mentioned, but i definitely recommend it, although, a little pricey....  i think it was something close to $20 for a pizza....

good service and you may happen to catch a celebrity or two!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Went there again for a work lunch and tried their pasta.  It was really good!  Good texture, good sauce, which speaking of which, is sort of funny.  I saw on the menu a spaghetti with lentils.  hmm, lentils?  

so i thought, ok, i like lentils, i like tomatoes and i like spinach, why not?

and i was pleasantly surprised.  Overall, a very solid restaurant."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,Amazing pesto that came with bread.  Pasta and ravioli was just ok.  Good service but expensive.  We had called to make reservations but they said they were booked then when we walked in it was empty.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"First time eating here for dinner and the dining room is beautiful, but it is very loud. It's difficult to have conversation. The pasta dish i had was amazing. It was a daily special orecchiette. My 9 year old loved it too. The service was great. The dessert pizza wasn't good. The crust tasted stale, and although the chocolate and marscapone topping was tasty, it couldn't compensate for the dry, tasteless crust. My daughter thought the gelato was too sweet. She like things more sweet than I do, so I didn't want to try it. The creme brulee was okay, but there was half a container left at the end and that's a sure sign that the taste wasn't fantastic."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Mediocre food and terrible service. Especially if you are a kid or are not dressed in the highest fashion, you will be treated as a peasant. Not worth the money."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Amazing service and food. The server from Brazil (forgot her name) was spot on with recommendations. We had the lasagna and veal. She recommended an amazing bottle of wine that topped off the evening. I wish we could give higher than 5 stars.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We loved this place. It was very quaint, romantic with great service. The bread was fresh . Highly recommend the vegetables called Margo. My husband and I both had pasta dishes. Mine was so unique with truffles,  leeks and mushrooms. We will come here again."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Like the other reviews say, great breakfast. I usually do Peabody's for breakfast, but if you want a little nicer place, cross the street to Tre Luna for something a little more refined."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Been coming here for years and up to know the place was a gem, proving decent food and service.
Something changed........
Came here for breakfast last week, place was pretty empty, maybe a dozen patrons, got seated and had a coffee poured, had the order taken and then waited.....and waited......had two coffee refillls and waited.
It was about then that I told my wife that we should just ask for the check and leave. after waiting another 5 minutes our breakfasts showed up. 45 minute wait for two plates is a problem. It appears that any staff had walked out and left the waitress to cook too.
For the price $60 for breakfast one shouldn't have to wait, and ignored.
we have notice the last few times the service has been suffering.....well I got news for the owner....I'm looking for a new place to give my money to!

Tried it again 3 months later, in early December and the service was totally different. I guess they fixed the issue at hand...."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I had breakfast here this morning. Absolutely fabulous! It was to die for. I will be going back! I had just walk and decided to stop. I'll be doing it again tomorrow! The service was great when they came, but the only negative was that they were not prompt. All in all... more than 5 stars! Delicious food!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,I went here today for breakfast and it was amazing. The staff is courteous and friendly and the manager Leslee was sooo sweet and welcoming. It's amazing they are open so early for breakfast. Not to mention the food is spectacular I'll be back very soon. Next trip dinner!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I looked forward to dinner but I was sadly disappointed.  My dish was so salty I had to use the potatoes, which had no flavor, to make it possible to eat.  I would have sent it back but the waitress waited until everyone was finished before she asked how are food was.  My husband's sand dabs were so breaded, he couldn't find the fish.  Unless you are one of their regular customers, you are ignored completely.  They need to go Olio & Limone, CaDario,  Pane Vino or Via Vie to know who to cook Italian food."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Just went here for first time in a long time.  Glad I did.  It was awesome.  I had the Pasta E Fagioli soup as an appetizer and then the Garganelli Alla Calabrese as my entree.   Both were excellent.  Even the bread before the meal was warm and delicious.  Our server was knowledgeable about the items on the menu and also the available wines.

They have both indoor and some outdoor seating.  I have seen other reviewers complain that it's ""loud inside.""  I'd say it's ""lively"" inside and it's great as long as you know what to expect.  If you want a more quiet experience, ask to sit outside.

This is a great place to take your family or a date.  I'll definitely be back soon."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Well for starters to get a menu, (btw with an attitude,sorry honey you didn't get the movie deal) took 15 minutes, to take the order was another 20 minutes to get the cold soup, was another 25 minutes and my guest had to inhale their lunch to get back to work, no one came to the table to ask if we need water, bread, some dessert or anything, our server is in the wrong profession and absolutely stoned faced. 

This is the first negative review I have ever written, if they were swarmed with lunch crowd hire more servers heavens knows you can afford it with they charge for food and horrible service, this whole experience cost me $115.00 includes tip,

I ask for grated cheese and the server assistant looked at me like I owed him money I said cheese in three different languages and he didn't get it!! I started with Italian,French then Spanish....No cheese!!

Won't be going back that's for sure, I don't care if I hit a bad day or not!! The owners are responsible to make sure employees are trained properly and maybe a nice Thank You, or please come back again could of made up for this total waste of time and money!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The ambiance was relax and friendly. Service good and we were served on time. 
food was fresh and very good.   We will definitely continue to go to Tre Lune."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The restaurant inside is a bit dark and to me felt stuffy, but there is great seating on the street for people-watching and enjoying the surroundings. The food is o-k, but everything else is great. I may return when I'm in the area."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Always the best in the area.  The atmosphere takes me back to Europe and the dishes are always as good as I have had in Europe.  My service has always been attentive, polite and congenial.  The dishes are served hot directly from the kitchen which I think is important.  Seating is not crowded and we are usually seating promptly or given options of inside or outside seating.   Highly recommend."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Very nice little restaurant, nice setting, nice ambiance.  Took the sig. other for her B-day dinner, the food was very good they also had a good selection of wines to choose from.  I had the Kobe burger (yes I know what was I doing ordering a burger at an Italian restaurant, but I just had to try it) and the b-day girl had the gnocchi.  I wished I had ordered something else because the burger was good and the fries amazing, but a 16 dollar burger (what was I thinking) the wifey's gnocchi on the other hand was great.  Very light dumplings not like the most I've had that tend to feel like a lump of bricks in tummy.  They also had wonderful basket of bread.  In addition the service was on par.... very good restaurant!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I went here for Valentines day and thought it was great. THe spinach spread they serve with the bread is delish! 

I also had the best minestrone of my LIFE. Seriously, so good. It has so many amazing vegetables and tastes fresh. 

The caesar salad I had was good, a little fishy but better than so many others I've had. 

The service was fantastic! The waitress was very knowledgeable and our food came unbelievably fast."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Very diappointing evening here recently....the food was average and that blond waitress doesn't know anything about providing decent service. She interupted us numerous times and could not get our standard order right. It was a ridiculous night and we now go to Lucky's, just down the street for excellent food and service. Also, the wine list here at Tre Lune is unfamilar unless you really know italian wines well. For really good Italian food, try OLIO Y LIMONE in Santa Barbara. The raviolis and salads are great at OLIO."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Best coffee and service 
Have had great dinners here am now trying breakfast 
I make preserves so I had to taste the ones they make here even before my breakfast
Wow
Lots of fruit not too much sugar 
Best preserves and coffee on the planet"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I went here for dinner with a group tonight and all of us were very disappointed. The first clue that the food would not be good was the amount of stuff on the menu. Being that the restaurant is small and not busy there is no way that all those dishes could be fresh everyday. 

We got a Burrata Caprese to share which was pretty good and the cocktails were descent, it's the rest of the food that left us feeling sick to our stomachs. I got the Risotto Mare e Monti - the shrimp were rubbery, the clams were full of sand, and the entire dish was over salted. One person got the Fettuccine Mare e Monti - it was okay but didn't have any lobster in it, instead it had what looked and tasted like shrimp.  Another person got a special risotto which was with kale and sausage which was so bad that we had to send it back.

The only reason that I did not give it one star was our server, he was great, he really outshined the entire place. As I sit here writing the review the food is legitimately churning in my stomach. Worst $150 I have ever spent, and it was only $150 because they took the god awful 'special risotto' off the ticket. The food is super overpriced for what you get."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"A very charming little Italian eatery... tucked away in Montecito.  The space itself is not large, and may seem crowded on a busy evening, but the decor is nice and inviting.  The service we received was friendly and attentive.  I enjoyed my food selection and my dining partners were also pleased.  I had a few glasses of Rose`... an Italian winery I've never heard of, very smooth.  The best part of the meal?...Meatballs.  Yes!  They were some the best tasting meatballs I've had in a long time... so good.  I would go back just for them..."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Montecito isn't lacking in Italian restaurants but Tre Lune feels and tastes the most authentic. The service is attentive and the atmosphere charming, cozy and exclusive (but not snobby). We like the pasta dishes but tend to favor the chicken or pizza which are good to split. The pizza selection is extensive, reasonably-priced and really top notch, not what you would expect from such a toney place."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Group of 9 of us came in. They were on top of taking care of us! I have some food allergies and they were so accommodating and did not make me feel bad about substitutions! Little pricy but worth it ! Great Italian dinner!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Tre Lune has reopened, and with its ""sister"" restaurant down the street, :ucky's, raised its prices again.  Soups now start at $13, salads at $17 and my favorite, Chicken Saltimbocca, which was $26 just a few years ago, is $35.  Chicken Parm, which I can get at in L.A. at really nice places: Craig's, Dan Tana's and The Palm for $32-$35, is $38.  The food is fine, service good, ambiance is just OK.  Will the locals and tourists in Montecito care about the prices?  Doubtful.  But Ca' Dario has just opened a few steps away.  I haven't tried it yet, but this is its fourth location and may give Tre Lune a run for its money."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,I've been coming here with friends for a very long time now. Best italian food by far in this neck of the woods.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"My friend and I had breakfast here recently and were both treated to a very memorable meal.  I had the omelet parmigiana.  I love eggplant parmigiana and this omelet had an EP filling that was tailored to go with the egg perfectly.  Unbelievably, the potato side that was served with this omelet was the star of the plate in my humble opinion.  Two cubes of potato seared on all sides and  seasoned perfectly.  I wish I could recreate this at home.  I know I'm going to try.

I see a reviewer below was wishing for a big pile of potatoes similar to Denny's.  Not me.  Quality over quantity every time.  

This place is the highest quality."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,The Penne Melchiori was seriously good.  It has been three days since I had it and I'm still thinking about it.  Next time I'll just order two with the hopes I don't lick both plates clean so I can have some to take home with me.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"All items ordered were excellent (see list below).  It was 1/2-3/4 full and people next to us were upset as no one came to take their order for a long while.  Our server was friendly and nice but they all seemed a little too busy with both inside and outside seating.  
The manager was seen by us eating with his fingers from a container in the area between the kitchen and dining area.  Guess he likes the food also.  
Items we loved were:
-Special asparagus soup for the day. 
-Melazane (rolled eggplant with mozarella and basil in tomato sauce). This was not salty at all. Just perfect.  
-Grilled seafood (lobster, crab, shrimp, scallop, and fish) with a side of vegies. 
-Salmon in lemon sauce with vegies.  The salmon was extremely fresh and the sauce was perfect!  

PS: little dogs were allowed inside the restaurant and sat with a woman everyone seemed to know.  There were dogs outside as well but weren't sure about them being inside albeit they were cute!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Great location, especially nice to sit outside! In terms of food, my husband liked his burger, and I had the Ellen salad which was delicious but extremely salty that made it very difficult to enjoy and so regret that the chef did go extreme levels of sodium. I would come back and reorder this but would definetly need to have them reassure that they can keep the salt under control. The bathroom stinks, and that's another reason why the score is 3 stars. Can't afford a scented candle?"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Got a Caesar salad as well as both a margarita and pepperoni pizza to go. Pizzas were good but me and my girlfriend ate both pretty easily. Salad was good. $50+ total. Could probably get a lot more bang for your buck at not much lower quality elsewhere. Nice restaurant though.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Best Cozy, auténtico Italian restaurant in downtown Montecito.  We were here for our birthdays, and exceptional ravioli's.  Above par service and a wonderful melange of excellent service and yummmy foods.  Thanks guys."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Simply the Best! 
Incredible Food, Amazing Service!
Having recently dined there I had occasion to pickup food to bring to a friends house. I was amazed on how wonderful it was. Everything prepared perfectly and ready when I arrived. 
Can't wait to go back."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I am updating a previous, really negative review.  Since 2015, we have been encouraged to try Tre Lune again.  We have had four dinners there and one brunch.  Every single time the service was lovely and the food was excellent.  I am so glad we gave this really cute local restaurant another chance, it did not disappoint."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Delicious breakfast in a fun atmosphere! I had the pancakes and eggs with bacon that was all cooked perfectly.  The coffee was so good I needed a second cup!  Great service!  We lucked out to walk in with no reservation on New Year's day.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"This restaurant was a random chance, stumbling-upon happy incident. The bread was delicious and the pesto dip they have is so tasty. Service was very nice and prompt, too! Interior decoration was very nice, filled with black and white photos of old celebrities and such. I recommend going for brunch with your friends or a nice, casual date with your significant other. No idea why previous reviews are so bad, but definitely worth the price and the visit. My boyfriend and I were both so full that it's been 3 hours and I'm still not digested!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Always enjoy stopping there for lunch or diner. Not the best but great and fresh .
Friendly staff.
Good italian food 
What else are you looking for ?
just stop there and enjoy"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We had a wonderful evening at Tre Lune.  The staff was exceptionally friendly, even accommodating my father's adjustments to the menu (rather than ordering the bresaola as it appeared on the menu--a somewhat unorthodox preparation with pesto--my father explained that he wanted it with olive oil and lemon juice--to create a traditional preparation--and the staff was happy to comply).  
My five year old daughters happily split the capriccossa pizza and were quite happy with it.  Everyone's meal was enjoyed.  I would definitely recommend Tre Lune for adults or families looking for a nice evening meal together."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in Santa Barbara.   Always consistent.  Always great.  From the food, to the service, to the simple but elegant interior."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,Just ordered the Tortellini filled w/asparagus and ricotta. Sounds great. Took a bite and had to spit it out. Horrible. I love their pizzas & they have a great breakfast. Please throw this one off the menu - $33.60 literally down the drain.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"The Best Menu, both Food & Wine I have seen in a long time. The Quality, Originality and authenticity are Awesome! Makes you want to go to Santa Barbara for Dinner!  Ciao!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"One of my fav places to visit in Santa Barbara. Pizza, Cauliflower and the GARGANELLI ALLA CALABRESE, Yum!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Very good spot. Breakfast is great, their coffee is amazing, and dinner is also very good. Recommend the Seafood Pasta with Pomodoro Sauce, or the Veal Parm."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The restaurant's presentation is first rate - Rolls Royce and Bentley outside, white tablecloths and professional looking waiters inside.  It's very noisy but some people like that and it isn't the restaurant's fault anyway.  The fettuccine with lobster and saffron had almost no lobster but tasted very fishy.  My tortellini with asparagus and walnut sauce was bland and I couldn't taste the asparagus but salt and Parmesan cheese helped.  The osso bucco looked good and had a very large portion of meat.  The spaghetti and meatballs was -well - spaghetti and meatballs.  The four of us split two spinach salads which we liked. Two glasses of white wine brought the tab up to $210 plus tip.  That seems stiff for what we got but maybe it's in the ballpark for Santa Barbara."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"5 stars for service alone! I have lived in SB 20 years now and we are so lucky with the number of yummy restaurants we have here. However, we have sub-par service most of the time. Most servers here don't understand why it is important to know the ingredients, kind of prep and about wine. They don't take it seriously and it's more of a side job. I really miss living in the Bay Area where servers know their craft. Anyway, the point is. The food at Tre Lune is quality and good and we love the authenticity but my husband, who isn't even as big of a foodie, said, ""Wow! It was worth this cost just for the service!"" I do think you can get nice Italian food for lower cost but the service is unmatchable and is completely worth it to us."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Far from a greasy spoon, this is one of the most inventive and delicious breakfast spots I've come across during my trip to CA. Order a cappuccino and go with one of the named dishes, like The Rose: two slices of olive bread topped with artichoke spread, two poached eggs, fingerling potatoes and some assorted fruit. It doesn't get much better than this!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,A quaint little gem nestled in Montecito. Loved it.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune is one of my favorite restaurants in Montecito! Great, authentic italian food with great service--Gabriel, who has been working there for years, is very kind. There are pictures of famous italians adorning the walls, so it's always fun to look around. My favorite dish is the Gnocchi Tartufati. I finish it everytime! Other dishes that are great are the Linguine Vongole, Spaghetti Polpette, and Spaghetti with lentil and tomato. Everytime we come it beats the last. Definitely a must go if you are in Santa Barbara/Montecito."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Service is excellent. Everyone is extremely polite and helpful. 

All food was excellent quality and very tasty. We ate Lamb Shanks & Veal specials & Caesar Salad for the evening. Different breads were brought out hot while we waited for main course. 

Restaurant was clean and elegant. 

Would definitely eat here again."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Italian food done right.  Deliciously excellent linguine alla vongole.  Perfect N.Y. Steak.  Righteous fettuccine al fredo.  Wine list superbly Italian.  Atmosphere authentic.  And one could converse without yelling at each other.  Treat yourself.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Amazing! Food is delicious! Service is awesome and friendly. 

Had this on my radar and took a friend for a birthday breakfast. The French Toast was amazing. Tasty. The coffee was the real deal! The portions were two meals in one! And the service was friendly as the staff is wonderful. This will be a new favorite go to place! 

They open early for breakfast and stay open through dinner. What!!! A truly great find in Montecito!!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We had an amazing brunch on a Sunday at around 1. We loved the food so much that we went back the next day on Labor Day. First off, you'd think that brunch would still be available since it was barely past 11:40. In general, the staff was very snobby and rude. It would be hard to enjoy a tasty meal with the people serving us being so unfriendly. After seating us and making us wait for 15 minutes, they said that the table was already reserved and asked us to move, despite the fact that I'm clearly disabled. The table we moved to was exactly the same as the other one (both outdoors too). We left and found a delicious place serving brunch down the street."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Friendly staff, good food. We sat outside for breakfast which I love to do. I had the healthy omelette it was a good combo of egg whites, asparagus and cheese."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,I reserved a table at this place and noted that my husband and I were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary. I was a little disappointed that we went the entire dinner and not one peep was mentioned about our celebratory dinner. The staff was friendly and our food was good. This place was highly recommended to us and I just think my expectations weren't met.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"High quality Italian dining - go for the specials!

This restaurant in Montecito impresses with quality fresh ingredients, an extensive [Italian only] wine list and attentive service. It was very quiet for a Saturday night - the town almost goes into sleepy mode after 9pm, so the vibe on the street was non-existent, but once you're inside the food, wine and service take you to a wonderful place in Italy where every mouthful of each dish we ordered is delectable and delightful. We ordered the special Stone Claw crab (so delicious in its original flavour you really only need the lemon - skip the tartare). The raw tuna with fresh tomatoes and avocado also freshened up and prepared our palates for the heavier entrees of lobster and porcini fettucine with tomato cream, and the melt-in-your-mouth simply grilled veal. A pinot noir (Red Angel on the Moonlight by Jermann Venezie Giulia) was the perfect accompaniment. We finished with a lovely and light panna cotta special with berries and espresso. You can't go wrong. A wonderful place to dine if you want to escape the hustle of State Street."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We had lunch here the vegetariano panini for my companion and the linguine and clam sauce for me.  Generous portion, well seasoned, but the soup of the day was disappointing.  Prmpt and friendly service, didn't feel rushed at all.  I will come back if I am ever in the area again."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I had a terrific lunch here recently...it seems as if they really take note of customer reviews and make efforts to improve. The watrecress salad and lamb were just right and the special risotto is usually good but you need to remind them not to bathe everything in salt. I'm health conscious so I ask them to steam the veggeis as they also overdo it on the olive oil. It remains a favorite (for a small town, anyway) and I will return. Also, the wait staff is more attentive now which is nice."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We were visiting from out of town and stopped here for dinner. We did not have a reservation, but they were able to still seat us indoors!  They had both indoor and outdoor seating available. The service was excellent and the food was amazing! Everything we ordered was delicious! We started with the Barrata Caprese and this was the first time for both of us trying Burrata cheese, so creamy and delicious! My husband ordered the Gnocchi and I had the Chicken Marsala we ended the meal with Creme Brule all amazing! So glad we stopped in on our last night in town, would highly recommend."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I went here for dinner and breakfast. Dinner was my favorite meal of the two. I had the osso bucco because I have never had it at an Italian restaurant and was in the mood for meat. The meat was tender and did not require a knife. I ate the whole thing and the portion was pretty big. It came with risotto, which tasted okay but sort of reminded me of rice-a-roni. Overall it was a good meal, and the waiter was attentive and friendly. For breakfast I had the Rose which was toast with an artichoke spread and eggs. Nothing spectacular....had better, and would not order it again. Overall, the restaurant provides friendly service, quiet atmosphere, and, being the people watcher that I am, there seems to be quite a few regulars that frequent the restaurant."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We stopped here for breakfast which we normally do each time we are here in Santa Barbara and have always had  a decent breakfast both from the tasty standpoint of it and the service has always been good.
This time, something was a miss, because we were seated right away and had our order taken, our coffee arrived and they the wait began.

We waited, and waited, meanwhile the other table next to us that ordered after us was served. 

The server came by and refilled our coffees and said our order would be right up.  Well ok it was after another 10 minutes. Mind you the place only had about 5 tables full and it was after the morning rush.
 The food did arrive and it was hot, and it tasted ok.  This was the time I wish I had my phone with me with the camera because I would have loved to have taken a picture of my egg dish. I ordered a couple of sunnyside up eggs and sausage.  What I saw on the plate instantly made the whole plate unappetizing. 

Usually I remember getting sausage links in several links.  What I got this time was a piece of sausage about 1/2 and inch  in diameter, about 6 or 7 inches long, that was curled up around it's self.
 Unless I had know it was a breakfast sausage of some kind, I could have mistaken it for something else, especially if it was placed on the sidewalk outside.....

Next time I will bring my camera, you had to have seen this to imagine what it looked like.   I almost sent the whole thing back, but after waiting for such a long time,  I opted to eat.

Aside from the lost order or whatever, either the cook has changed or something else because what use to be a nice hearty breakfast , eggs,  some great potatoes was now a couple of eggs with about 4 or 5 small pieces of potatoes.  Come on, potatoes are cheap, you could at least load the plate so it looked like you were getting something for the 15 bucks to put down in front of the customer.  Denny's for 8 bucks can do it all day, you would think they could make a better effort. My only thought was that they must of run out of potatoes,  and the usual garnish of a sliced orange or fruit, and just decided to plop down the eggs and half handful of potatoes and so be it.
Bring back the old Tre Lune, we'll try it one more time, before we totally write it off."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"It is very difficult to eat out when your allergies limit you to nothing but the most basic of foods.  However, our waiter, whose name I unfortunately cannot remember, was very careful to have the chef prepare me a version of their Organic Chicken Limone without all the ingredients that would otherwise make me ill.  
The meal was also prepared in fairly short order.
The setting of the outdoor patio was lovely and all the people were friendly.  
Overall a wonderful lunch experience!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"no enthusiasm from either the lady or man at the front of the restaurant on our arrival.....I confirmed our reservation, we were on time, and all that was communicated was a curt"" table 13"" from the lady ( presume one or both were managers)...then taken to said table with not a word from the man....very poor start !!!
Our waiter failed to introduce himself but otherwise was efficient and attentive throughout our service
the food was excellent, hence the 3 stars and the cost overall reasonable given the location
Subsequent diners were given the full, kiss kiss, hug hug from said managers and i presume they are local and regular visitors.....however we stay in the Montecito area at least 4 times a year and perhaps management needs to consider how they welcome new customers....a friendly smile can work wonders !!!!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The hostess was super sweet, but the waitress was totally snooty for some unknown reason. The bread and green ""dip"" was average, the food was fine but nothing exceptional. Heads-up people, we brought two bottles of wine for our party of four. We were charged a $30 corkage fee per bottle (60 dollars!), which seems ridiculously high even for Montecito standards."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We will drive to Montecito just to enjoy the heavenly Gnocchi and the Tre Lune brand Pinot Grigio, not to forget their delicious appetizers and pizzas. 

The Tri Fungi pasta is also a must!

Servers are AMAZING. Lupita is the best."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune has some of the best Italian food I've ever eaten. I've never had a bad meal there. The pastas are delicious, seafood is always cooked to perfection. The last time we went we had a fabulous waiter, Gabriel, who made the visit so special. They have these great homemade butter cookies that you can get with your bill if you don't have room left for dessert. It's a great touch.  It's always busy when we're there and sometimes it takes a few minutes to get a drink order, but well worth it."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We had a fabulous dinner at Tre Lune. Booked our table through Open Table and only got outdoor seating. First I thought it could be too cold but it turned out so beautiful & nice under the heater outside plus we were able to carry on a conversation because it was not loud at all. 
The server was very nice & friendly and so was the guy who brought the bread first thing to the table after sitting down. The variety of bread with the pesto dip was already a great start to a wonderful meal. 
We shared the grilled octopus as our appetizer. Hubby had the parpadelle ragu & I had the veal scaloppini with the lemon caper sauce & a half order of the pasta Alfredo. It was delicious! 
The prices seem fair too in comparison to all the overpriced surrounding restaurants. 
I would go back to this restaurant when back in the area."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune is without question the best place to get brunch in the 805. I am what my wife would call particular about the type and level of service I receive when I go out. I often have strong opinions about various establishments in and around the 805. On a whim we decided to try Tre Lune earlier this year and it quickly became a favorite haunt. 

The service is impeccable, the food is consistently perfect and staff professional and welcoming. 

It is a great place for date night or to share with family. 

As a former New Yorker it's easy for me to find the good the bad and the ugly in most places but after a half dozen visits now it seems Tre Lune is a winner."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We used to like this place. Our latest visit was not a good experience. There seemed to be ample help compared to customers but only one working waiter. The food lacked taste as well a descent presentation. We are wondering if ownership changed hands. Too bad because the facility is cozy and the few tables outside are really nice to capture downtown Montecito. Sure hope they get their act together.
Cheers,
Barry C"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I have dined at this lovely, convivial restaurant for many years, but sadly, no more.  I decided to support Tre Lune during another restaurant lock-down by ordering take out.  The artichokes in my INSALATA POMODORI e RUCOLA looked liked freeze dried ones and the chef should learn what mustard vinaigrette dressing ingredients are.  I would upload photos but do not like Yelp 's terms for doing so. 

The waitstaff is fabulous, friendly and accommodating.  Too bad the kitchen cannot do their part. In these hard times, it's probably a good idea to make sure the food is superb, especially for takeout.  I don't think this restaurant would get away with serving this salad if they were open for dining in."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Tre Lune serves delicious Italian food. The place is small but the food is great. It is on the pricy side.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"From December before they were shut down:
Service  was excellent up until it came to pay the bill and our plates were cleared. We had a wonderful lady server in the beginning who brought us everything and she also asked if we wanted more bread. Then at the end of our meal, a guy waiter (with heavy accent) came over to start taking our plates away. I was still taking the last bites off mine and had to tell him I'm still working on it since he asked me if he could take my plate. After that he kept going in and out of the restaurant to clear other tables and do things and never came back by to check on us or at least bring us the bill. We had to actually call out for him to stop to ask to bring us the check. He said he would bring it out. So he did and then we stuck $100 bill in there and he took it back shortly after. How long does it take to get us change from cash??? Like 10 minutes went by and he kept walking back and forth in and outside to do whatever he was doing. Again we had to ask him for our change. We were thinking he was trying to pull a fast one on us like he thought we were giving him a $60 tip and that we would just leave??? He wasn't even our waiter. He made up some excuse like his manager was busy or something so I thought maybe they had to check the $100?? I don't know. But he finally brought out the change. It was just really weird and no communication we just felt ignored!!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"This is my favorite spot, and my husband's favorite spot.  The clam appetizer is worth the visit alone.  We had the cacio e pepe which is fantastic; the fettucine alfredo, and tried the various seafood appetizer specials which were each fantastic.  The al fresco dining right now is fantastic; the service is fantastic, and the restaurant is so great we went two nights in a row.  Wonderful music and great vibe."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The WORST dining experience ever!
We recently moved into the community and remembered eating there a couple of years ago. After being ignored for more than 20 minutes, we asked the hostess if we had a server. It still took a while before the server came. We placed a drink order and had to wait  at least 20 minutes for those. We actually had to remind the server about the drinks and the bread - which we asked for 3 times. There was another long lag before our order was taken.  Then the entrees appeared before the salad. We were never asked if we wanted another round of drinks or wine. We felt we had to specify that we expected new dinners prepared, not reheating the original food served. 
Meanwhile, the hostesses came by to apologize, the server apologized several times and the woman who acted like the manager apologized a couple of times. Instead of apologizing, the hostesses and manager should have pitched in to help the, obviously, over-burdened servers. However, they were too busy fawning over a few select tables. While the server certainly has culpability, the ultimate responsibly for ensuring patrons' positive experience lies with the management who failed miserably. The food was very good, not extraordinary, as remembered. It shouldn't take an hour and a half to have entrees served. Needless to say, we will never return."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"This is my second visit to Tre Lune. I have only eaten breakfast here.  It's a perfect place for a more upscale breakfast with Mimosa's and white tablecloths.  I'm
HUGE  on ambience so this place is perfect with an old Hollywood style feel of black and white photos on the wall.  I hear the same people own Lucky's Steak house, just down the street.  The Salmon Benedict was great, but even better was the Brioce French toast my boyfriend ordered.  Heavenly.! Our server was also great and gave recommendations and was very attentive and friendly.  
This is a local's place as well. Some people dress very casually with flip flops and hats.  It's nice inside but not stuffy for a weekend breakfast spot."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,We has dinner there last night. We had reservations and were seated right away. The place was full and busy. They have a full bar so I ordered a drink and Robin had a glass of wine. I had the veal picatta. It was good but just a bit off as far as tangy ness. I think it could have used more lemon. It came with three small sides of vegetables. The veal serving was three large pieces which was very generous. It's decent Italian food with a nice atmosphere. Our waitress was Brittany and she was very prompt and polite. I recommend reservations for dinner.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"TOP italian experience!!!
Each and every bite recall best memories of real italian autentic food in Italy.
Sea food, veal, pasta w salmon, ossobucco  plus all other food we got...omg how we enjoyed..
Also, vine list 
Be back.. again, as we always do"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"So glad we had made reservations on Memorial Day weekend. Food was good. Nice, cute place. We sat outside. The Mushroom pasta was yummy. Service was good as well. The waiter recommended the friend calamari and even though was friend it was done to perfection, not deeply friend and was tasty. I think the food could use a bit of spice, or kick but that's my opinion."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Breakfast staff, you are not doing your job, and its obvious to me you don't want to be there, so stay home or give the great service we have always had for years. That is all I will say you know who you are. I give 3 stars which should be 5 because the cook does not deserve to get less because of your actions. Last week 2 days in a row when you were not busy it was bad service so I tried again this week. whats up!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,The food was amazing! The staff was on point and very attentive. I highly recommend Tre Lune!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune was very busy tonight for a Wednesday! Not having made reservations, and nothing available for an hour, we decided to eat at the bar. 
Our experience tonight with Gabriel, our waiter, and our bartender Robert was exceptional! Thank you for a fantastic meal and completely enjoyable evening."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"My boyfriend and I ate here for our date night last Wednesday. Being a former server of many years I have high standards and our server was perfect. She gave refined, non obtrusive service, knew every detail about every dish and was friendly. We started with the summer tomato, peach and burrata salad, I ordered the artichoke ravioli with a creamy walnut sauce and my boyfriend had the wild boar Ragu pasta. We loved it all. We look forward to coming back again soon."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I'm writing this review based on a take out order, so in defense of the restaurant, and perhaps a great experience you have had, this is all about take out. The gist of this review applies to many restaurants. This is my personal rant on expensive take out! 

I always am leery about take out from places, that although have tremendous food, sometimes just don't get it right with food that travels. I almost wish a restaurant would say ""no"" to take out, rather than allow the dishes to leave the restaurant in a plastic container, in the way it was not meant to be. But as diners, we fuel this problem by demanding the food from our favorite restaurants, be allowed to be eaten at home. Pizza, chicken wings, Italian beef sandwiches and the like, were designed to travel, be reheated, microwaved, eaten cold, or be eaten days later without much harm. And chances are, you didn't spend an arm & a leg on this stuff, so who really cares. You stuffed yourself on a mediocre, yet piping hot pizza! 

We were in town to visit friends in Santa Barbara. Last minute, we decide to get food to-go. Mind you, there's plenty of great food in SB, but it was getting a little later in the evening, and the town of Montecito was just a few blocks away. We stopped by the Honor Bar, which we should have ordered from, but the group had take out from them a night before. Great place. A glass of wine was had, but we decided to opt out for Italian. 

Tre Luna is just steps away, so we head over there. Pretty full, but we make our way to the small bar in the back. Nice little place filled with diners of all ages. Probably lots of old money, pampered by the staff in the know. I get it.

We have a couple glasses of wine and order take out. Pollo limone, pollo marsala, burrata caprese, Tre Luna salad, soup, caesar salad & grilled calamari. It took a while to get the order, but they were busy, so no big deal. We get our bag, and we're home in minutes. 

Let's eat! But wait! Where's the $11 Caesar salad? Not there! We're hungry & tired. Forget about it, and let's just eat. The 2 small foil containers of Marsala & Limone go really fast between the four of us. The grilled calamari is barely eaten. It's too chewy. The Tre Luna salad & soup are just uneventful. The saddest was the burrata caprese. We've all had this in some shape or form. Some fresh burrata, fresh basil, perhaps some nice heirloom tomatoes. A little sea salt & you're done! Not so much here.  The burrata was fine, but the tomatoes were a total embarrassment to the history of this simple dish. Perhaps a small Roma tomato was used, sliced so thin, that the ""carpaccio style"" sliced tomatoes were buried under the weight of the cheese. They should have worn a mask, robbing $17 from me for this dish. 

What else can I say. Were the chicken dishes both mediocre because they were take out? Was the calamari chewy because it steamed itself into a frenzy under the tight lid? But that caprese? They have no excuse for that or the missing Caesar salad. 

I sometimes believe that the kitchen figures that when preparing items to go, they can short change the customer. There's no manager or server to immediately bitch about the portion, or the thinly sliced tomatoes. It's all wrapped up in tight little containers. Hell these cooks have a bunch of food going out to the dining room & this take out is just a pain in the ass to them. Throw it in a container & pack it away. We're busy in here dammit! 

So in part, I'm to blame for expecting great food, (when it is), to be eaten off premises, out of a foil container, 15 minutes after it came out of the kitchen. But on this flip side, you said it was ok to do carry out. You stock the containers, the bags, the plastic forks, etc, to facilitate your precious food to take home. There were no discounts off the bill stating that carry out food tends to be much crappier than food eaten in, so here's 25% off the bill for this mediocre presentation of our food. 

As a restaurant, you secretly know, that a take out order requires just the cost of the containers, bag, plastic ware, etc. There's no bus boys, dishwashers, servers, expensive napkins or a prime table taken up on a Saturday night. All of the expense that goes into a table of a 2 or 4 goes away, and simply packaged up into a shopping bag full of mediocre food. We spent $125 plus a 20% tip. 

The bottom line here? If you're out to preserve the authenticity of your Italian dishes, either figure out a way to send them home with the integrity of the dish, as dined in-house, or just deny us take out! Or maybe just say that all food to go, is 1/2 off? Then no one complains. We took a risk & you rewarded us. 

It's just not acceptable to spend that kind of money, for such a major disappointment. 

I'm done!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Delicious breakfast with great service & nice outdoor seating. Everything was delicious. Their eggs rose   might be best breakfast dish in SB. Also available at D'Angelo downtown. Their large OJ is fresh squeezed and delicious. For some reason the D'Angelo large OJ is not a large/overpriced but here at Tre Lune it's copious. Perfect meal!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,This place deserves way above it's current overall rating. The service and food were extraordinary. The atmosphere is cozy. I will come back many times. The server was super accommodating that I wanted gluten-free options. Ordered the gluten free fusilli (quinoa) with meatballs and he pasta was not only perfectly al dente but meatballs and sauce were Italian grandmother level delicious. Accompanied by excellent olive oil and parmagiano reggiano as well as a really fresh and flavorful spinach pesto they bring to every table this was just a dreamy meal. I would come a great distance to eat this again. Portions were also big so I took another meal's worth home! Love love love
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Having lost Piattis and refusing to deal with the ""attitude"" at Pane Vino, Molly's, and Via Vai, we had been enjoying Tre Lune quite a bit over the last year.  Yes, fairly consistent quality food at a moderately inflated price.  But tonite was so disturbing that I am still not sure if it really happened.  

Let me say that I have dined at my fair share of 5 star restaurants in my life.  But I have never really encountered anything quite like this before.  After arriving 16 minutes late for a 6 pm dinner reservation on a cold January Saturday night(actually 15 minutes late because the host was not immediately available at his station when we initially arrived), we were smugly informed by the irritable host that we were ""20 minutes late"" and we could only ""have the table"" until 8 pm.  Whattttt???????!!!!!!!!  Isn't going out for dinner supposed to be a pleasant experience that is to be enjoyed and savored?  After jokingly reminding him that my good old iPhone said we were actually 16 minutes late, I told him that yes we could clear out by 8 pm as long as the wait staff were attentive to the time.  

I wondered what would happen if it was after 8 pm and we were still not finished.  Would we actually be asked to leave or would we simply turn into pumpkins?  My 18 year old wondered aloud if we should just leave (in retrospect, we should have left and given ""the table"" back). Believe it or not, the ""host"" quipped back that we were actually ""16 and a half minutes late."". Really??? 

 Things didn't improve much when our blonde waitress rudely corrected me and my son regarding our Italian pronunciation of various menu items in a condescending manner.  Sooo irritating especially in Santa Barbara (we are not in Italy and you are not my high school Italian instructor).  Fortunately, the other wait staff were courteous and professional.  With our two teenage sons, we finished our meal at 730 but I really wanted to keep the table until 759 but I couldn't get out of there quick enough.  Fine.  You have successfully and permanently eliminated your restaurant from the rotation.  

What kind of attitude is this?  If I live locally in Montecito and patronize your restaurant, why the attitude????  Yes, we were late but the hostile grade school teacher tardy tude is soooo ridiculous.   Rather than a subtle comment about our timing like ""we were worried that you weren't going to join us tonite but we are so glad you made it"" OR no comment at all and just a warm welcome, we received the perfect way to ruin a $200 meal.  Such a turn off.  Well, the only way to combat this is to vote with your feet and head downtown to Alfredo at Olio Limone or to Ca'Dario.  Or just head down the road to good old Stella Mare's.  Bye bye!!!!!!  Flat out unforgivable behavior.  Embarrassingly BAD service."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"The food was fantastic and the service was exceptional! They also have a very thorough yet affordable wine list. Our waiter offered us a tasting of four wines, which we couldn't say no to. We're glad he did because we found a really amazing Sangiovese wine!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Great local Italian restaurant with delicious food. Service was excellent and the outdoor dining is great In today's world!
I will be visiting again soon!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I checked some reviews about this restaurant before i went. I was there for breakfast with my boy friend. At first we were standing for 5 mins before someone actually talked to us. All the poeple worked there saw us yet no one helped us. It wasn't a super busy day. It took us another 10 min to get some water and another 10 min to order.finally we got our food, our food was cold. I don't know how they got such high reviews when my experience was so bad."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Up until a few years ago I LOVED dining at Tre Lune (even celebrated my 40th there!) for many years. Always delicious and always a good time. Until one one afternoon while there with my brother and a good friend we experienced racism in its subtle and micro-aggression capacities. Our friend is African-American and our table was definitely treated differently than the other table (only two parties dining (us included) outside at the time). We were singled out asking to leave soon, we weren't waited on as much as the other table - just a couple of behaviors of what happened that day. 

Tre Lune will no longer be getting my support nor will I speak highly of them when asked where to visit in Montecito. What a disappointment. The female employee (hostess) should be ashamed of herself. Tre Lune - you might want to consider educating your staff in how to be aware, accepting and kind. And if they realize they discriminate, perhaps they need some sort of training and education. Good luck."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Bad service and really bad attitude. They act like they are doing you a favor by accepting your business.
Last time I said I would never go back and this time I really mean it.
They accept reservations but that doesn't really mean you will get a table.
Last year they didn't honor my reservation because of a scheduling problem.
Last night all they had was a small table squeezed in between two other large groups and a place in a doorway.
When I asked for any of five empty tables, not in the doorway, the hostess said they are for regular customers that specified a location.
When I asked why they didn't tell me that I could ask for a decent table, when I made my reservation, she replied, I can put you in our database as a customer for next time.
We left and went to Pan an Vino, where they are always happy to see a customer and try to accommodate anyone, not just regulars.
Why would anyone go to restaurant with an attitude like this"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Such amazing italian food  and So yummy and so nice to see the locals & visitors eating out and supporting our community we had the calazone and the pasta & sausage which was fantastic
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Wow! If you want a good bite to eat or have a special occasion I'd come here! Was recommended by a friend and wasn't disappointed:) the lasagna was fab and the home made chili oil was outstanding!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Amazing mid week meal!  Ambiance and service were excellent Gabriel best waiter ever! The tortellini with Walnut Cream sauce is amazing and great wine menu! Delicious passion fruit gelato and the coconut tart had to try also with a subtle  and elegant taste oh la la. Make reservations because the locals love it too
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,This place had some of the best pasta I've had. Great salad and bread as well and the service was great. Will definitely go back!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Ordered takeout last night for 4. Food arrived hot and was soooo good!!  Would give this place 10 stars if I could.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Oh my god .... It's taking so long for my food to arrive that I am writing this review while I'm seated at the restaurant waiting for my food. It's been one hour since we sat at 5 and my appetizer just arrived . Busy place, service is meh unless your an old white man or celebrity of some sort. For the prices you're paying , I was expecting more than this. Then brought out the dried cheese for my entree and it's been 15 minutes and no entree. Beyond Disappointing"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Good service, ambience is fun but not as lively as Lucky's their sibling.   Is nice for a quieter dinner outside.  Food is pretty good.  The Friday shrimp salad special is delicious and not to be confused with their regular shrimp salad."

They had both indoor and outdoor seating available. The service was excellent and the food was amazing! Everything we ordered was delicious! We started with the Barrata Caprese and this was the first time for both of us trying Burrata cheese, so creamy and delicious! My husband ordered the Gnocchi and I had the Chicken Marsala we ended the meal with Creme Brule all amazing! So glad we stopped in on our last night in town, would highly recommend."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Have you ever known something was going to be delicious before it even touches your tongue, that is how I'd describe the two dishes we tried there (Tortellini and Gnocchi), really really tasty, great location and great service.  Me and the wife stayed in Santa Barbara and with all the outstanding food we still came here twice."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Food was amazing.  All 5 of us really loved the pastas we ordered.  The service was also spot on, starting with the manager (or owner) greeting us promptly and asking if we wanted a cocktail while we waited for our table.  Our server was definitely from Italy, it is that kind of italian restaurant.  It will be my first stop the next time I am in Santa Barbara."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"An exceptional dining offering in Montecino! We had the Ellen Salad, a perfectly dressed bed of greens topped with seared ocean delights, cooked to absolute perfection, and the Fettucine Mare e Monti, a delightful bed of pasta in a saffron cream sauce with mushrooms and lobster, again cooked exceptionally delicately. Considering every other kitchen in Montevideo closes between 3 and 4:30, it was a bit of fortune that brought us here, but it will be top choice when we come back. If you're looking for a bit more COVID- careful area than the typical scene in SB, drive a little out of your way and dine here."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Updating my review from our most recent visit on September  15th. My daughter was ASSAULTED at the restaurant by another table! The restaurant offered no apologies and didn't even acknowledge to us that it happened! Two waiters rushed over to the table that threw the item that hit my daughter on the head, but nothing was said. The floor manager Ernesto, never even came out! We were just finishing our main course and my gay daughter was so humiliated that she just got up and left. I just couldn't believe that the waiter still said nothing to us when he again came to our table. I figured that the offending table was just being rich poorly behaved BIGOTS.  I did not want to make a scene. I asked my husband to get the bill as I needed to use the restroom. As I was entering the restaurant, in the doorway a woman from another table started to call out ""Pay your check!"" I was so stunned I just stopped and stared. The waiters, service people and bus boys were forced to go around me. She said extremely loudly that she has been ""watching our table all night and you don't want to pay your bill!"" I basically ran to the restroom and just want to leave this horrible place! As I am leaving the building she starts back up very loudly saying ""Pay your check!"" I collect my things and leave my husband with my autistic daughter, extremely well behaved, to finish up. The ONLY person to apologize to me was a very kind busboy! As I go by the woman to leave she starts in again very loudly about my check! I said that she was extremely rude and she threatened to call the police on ME!! Where was a manager, or a waiter? None to be seen! I just leave as this is now a nightmare circus and the inmates are running the asylum! When my husband finished up he called me to come back to the car.  He has been reseated and given ice cream. Was anyone there to apologize to my daughter or myself, NO! As we were leaving the same woman starts filming my family and our car! I've called and asked what was going on but it's been 2 days. I don't want to get the police involved, but they have NO control of their customers or their restaurant! If you are a member of a minority group or not heavily moneyed, DON'T GO. We have eaten in thousands of better restaurants all over the world and have never been treated so horribly."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I went there for a birthday, the service is great, the food is fresh and good quality and the prices are reasonable. None of the dishes were mind blowing but they were very good. I really enjoyed their affogato."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"**Parking was a bit hard to find; and at the time, there were three parking spots open in front of the restaurant but only for valet to the jewelry store next door which I thought was very silly**

No restaurant greatly represents the quintessential Montecito vibe better than Tre Lune, an authentic Italian restaurant led by chef Soemi Caramel.

As my boyfriend and I entered Tre Lune, we were immediately looked over by a room filled with pretentious patrons' prying eyes, but was warmly welcomed by an astute hostess that accommodated us to an already reserved table that seats four which was greatly appreciated.

THE STAFF-

As we sat down, to my understanding was our waiter, trying to sell us only the most expensive dishes to be their ""most recommended dishes"". $95 for a truffled pasta? Give me a break. 

When it came to us asking our waiter what wine bottle he'd recommend for the meal, he frantically flipped through the pages and pointed straight to the $400 and $600 wine bottles. We ordered a very simple pinot noir which didn't exceed more than $70 and my boyfriend said it tasted like $5 Trader Joe's wine Lol go figure.

THE FOOD-

We ordered their Vellutata di broccoli ($9),  which is essentially broccoli soup in vegetable broth as an appetizer for myself; it was topped with freshly crushed pepper but it still lacked basic flavor. It seemed to be a very underwhelming dish to start with.

My boyfriend had ordered the Fettucine Mare e Monte ($25.50), which was fettucine drenched in delicious safron-tomato sauce, and served with fresh lobster meat and Porcini mushrooms. 

I went and ordered their Pollo Saltimbocca ($27.50), which was very delectable chicken breast sauteed with mouthwatering prosciutto, melted Fontina cheese, sage, and Marsala wine. 

The pinot noir we ordered paired very well with my boyfriend's pasta which was very enjoyable and surprisingly the softest pasta I've ever tried.

We ended our meal with a few glasses of their tastiest sherry and a caffe desert.

Tre Lune is sophisticated yet approachable, and I can't wait to try other dishes at this restaurant on my next visit."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"My mom took my fiancée and me here for brunch while we were visiting her, and she usually loves it, but we were not impressed. Perhaps we're spoiled from living in San Francisco, but the service was terrible -- we were seated for a full five minutes before even getting offered menus, they never checked to see how we were doing, etc. They had plenty of staff, and it wasn't really that crowded, so there's no excuse there.

My mom had the baked egg dish with parmesan baked into the top, which was pretty good. We both had benedict dishes, which had very little hollandaise and were pretty bland. It's a good thing we asked for the olive bread, because that was the highlight. The menu offered a french toast with fresh strawberries, which we didn't get because we decided we would rather get a fruit bowl, but the fruit bowl didn't come with any strawberries! Just melon and grapes.

Next time we go to Santa Barbara, we will find a different place to brunch."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Service was wonderful, from the kind and professional hostess that sat us, to the attentive, knowledgeable server. (Jake -- what a gem)! The rest of the team players, especially the chef were also great. The meal was wonderful. Really fresh ingredients, nice portions, well seasoned - not heavy or oily -- and served at appropriate temperatures. I had the white fish and my husband had the pasta with sausage. We will definitely go there again."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Delicious Delicious Delicious. Haven't had a bad meal and try something new every time. We love the zucchini flowers appetizer and 
BRUSCHETTA AGLI ASPARAGI."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"The vegetable zuppa/ soup was quite delicious! High quality food with great customer service & food variety. Pasta dish was full of flavor without being too heavy or oily. Veal was perfectly prepared. Raphael provided excellent wine pairing recommendations. Thank you, will revisit soon!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We went to this lovely place with good friends..
Our friends frequently dine here..
I  must say we had a wonderful time..The service was excellent and the shrimp pasta I had was OUTSTANDING!
My husband and friends loved their choices also..
It was all delicious!
The prices were high, but the food and service was worth it..
Great restaurant for special occasions..
Thank you Tre Lune and staff for great food and a lovely evening!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Perfect dinner spot! Stayed at the Montecito Inn and came here for dinner, great food and atmosphere. I highly recommend this place. The staff is very pleasant and helpful. I'm vegan and they were able alter a pasta dish for me. It was very delicious."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Lovely outdoor setting on the street.....quieter than most setting because it's Monticedo.

 We ordered GF pizza and GF pasta with a tomato cream sauce that was perfectly balanced. The meal  included an  antipasto plate as well as bread which I find to be generous.

The ambiance, the food quality, the excellent service as well as extensive wine menu make this place a five-star and a place I will be returning to next month!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Amazing, authentic Italian food. One of the best restaurants in montecito!! The cacio Pepe is great, the salmon and potatoes are amazing and the pizza is another one to try."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"The food was fantastically cooked.  The service, well it could've been better.  Let me start with the food; it was excellent.  The meat was well cooked and tender and the pasta was cooked to perfection.  I would get the Lasagna again every time.  However, the service was slow.  It took us more than 20 minutes to get our appetizers and more than 20 after that for our entrees.  One of the employees, although not our waitress, removed an empty glass of water and forgot to bring us a new one.  Overall, the restaurant was great, but the service could be a little bit better."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The hostess was very welcoming but our server was rude and seemed like we were an inconvenience (even though the place was empty). The food was good, and the portions were large. Just disappointed about the service."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Gabriel was our server. He went above and beyond. The wine he recommended was spectacular, thankfully I had a driver. Definitely will be back thanks to him and Cabernet Sauvignon. Thank you Gabriel!!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We took our family of 5 to our first outdoor dining experience during Covid and had the most delicious meal and excellent service. I had the rigatoni ai tre fungi and it was so delicious with so much flavor. My husband had the Fettuccine Alfredo and it was delicious and the cream sauce was light, flavorful and not too heavy. They were so kid friendly and served all of our kids pasta and parmesan, every one left happy. It was a success for our first dining during Covid. We were traveling back down to our home in San Diego and I noticed I left my apple ear pods (they are pretty penny), so I called the manager a few days after our dinner to see if they had found them. The restaurant held on to them and mailed them to my home. What wonderful customer service, we will be stopping at Tre Lune every time we are in the Santa Barbara Area."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The main reason I would recommend this place to anybody is based off the atmosphere(very fine dining) and overall reputation of this restaurant. Come for dinner sometime during the week there's a 50% chance you'll see a celebrity. My experience this time was a bit under whelming I was looking for a good pizza, but was  disappointed the ingredients on it tasted extremely fresh, but the overall dough and taste of it was nothing to be impressed of it tasted almost a bit pasty very slightly though(The Capricciosa is shown in the image). Caesar salad was good and complimented it well. The minestrone was good it tasted like pure vegetable something my mom would almost make. Last time I was here I ordered a pasta and was blown away how good it was I got the Mare e Monte I can highly recommend that to anybody that definitely tasted more authentic to an Italian flavor than the Pizza. The only reason I give this place a 3 Star is because of past experiences here I was just let down this time with the pizza. I'll still be coming back, but only for bigger course entrees (not pizza) . The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Oh and be ready to spend a pretty penny the food in that image was about $60 + a tip."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"The pasta, pizza and service were amazing! Try the mushroom pizza! However, the night before we had reservations we rolled in to town late and asked for a table around 715. The hostess was aloof and dismissive. Compared to the amazing waite and bus staff the hostess is disappointing. Entitlement is disappointing."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We made a reservation over a week ago for a business dinner.  It's a hot day.  We got there right on time for our reservation.  They told us that they were overbooked and could only seat us outside since we did not specifically request inside seating.  Meanwhile, there were at least five open tables in the restaurant.  After melting on their patio for a few moments, we left and went to Cava, just down the street.  Cava was wonderful.  Go there."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I was in town for a wedding on my own and had been recommended Tre Lune by an LA friend. The little Italian restaurant is charming and spreads classic Italian. You feel as though Frank Sinatra must have eaten here at some point in their history. I sat at the bar which was very tiny and not much of the bar scene that I was hoping it to have. Although, the food was spectacular. They had all my favorites on the menu and the bartender and staff were so very friendly. The food came out quick and all in all- I was out in 30-45 minutes. Would eat here again if I am in town but will definitely call ahead to make reservations to enjoy the restaurant ambiance more. Great for date nights or family gatherings but probably not the best for solo travelers looking to mingle."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"18 months ago i posted a 3 star review praising the food but unhappy with service
we are back in SB, on vacation, and decided to try again on saturday and so very pleased we did....our server was Nicky and she was wonderful...friendly, efficient, helpful and 100% at the top of her game
once again the food was superb and this time, with great service i have no hesitation in giving a 5 star review.....as mentioned before , what a difference a smile makes on arrival and from the server ( well lots of smiles from Nicky !!!!)"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We have been coming here for years for brunch and dinner from LA and normally would give this place 5 stars for the food but we are giving 1 star for the rude treatment we received from the hostess yesterday and ended up leaving and going to Lucky's where we were treated with the utmost care and had an even better brunch.  We changed our reservation because of terrible traffic on Memorial Weekend and they said they would save our reservation and table outside.  It was also my birthday yesterday so I was excited for brunch.  We arrived and the hostess treated my daughter rudely, told her that we would have to order quickly because brunch was s almost over, threw the menus on the table and then grabbed the menus back and said we couldn't order brunch anymore.  We arrived before 11:30.  She slapped the lunch/dinner menus on table and huffed away.  Our waiter came over and told us the same thing.  We got up and left and probably will never come here again."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Local Montecito with all that it conjures lunch scene ... Beautiful people, understated wealth & the occasional overstated, put together California style, good for business lunches to girls lunches and multi generational family lunches.  

Spice tip: If u like spice, ask for the pepper infused olive oil. Yum. One of the best

Ordering tip: good luck is needed sometimes: Mushroom tagliatelle special. Very good but when I ordered to have lots of mushrooms, it seems the opposite was presented.  Tre lune I am a fan, but please Don't skimp on this especially if request is for more.
Servers: polished and do try. Maybe disconnect with kitchen and waiter
Breakfast: yum good veggie sauté.  Delicious but witnessed same disconnect between kitchen and servers with a few lost in translation moments.  This was the case for my friends...but was still tasty and great ambience for morning start."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Who puts sugar in their tomato sauce? This place does. And way too much. 
The salads were mediocre and the dressing was especially bland. 
The half chicken was over cooked and dry. 
We were the first people in the restaurant and it still took over an hour to get our food. 
Overall, they must not be testing their food before serving. 
Service was ok. Too expensive for what you get."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Lovely outdoor dining area.
Delicious food, but: (1) the bread was dried out (must have been sliced many, many hours earlier), (2) the mashed potatoes were lukewarm, and (3) the main dish, though delicious, could have been hotter.
The service was poor: the waiter was indifferent and mostly absent. We had to wait at least 20 minutes before ordering. It took forever for a glass of wine to arrive. And the waiter was nowhere to be seen when we wanted to order more wine. When we finished dinner he was still MIA; we had to go inside the restaurant to ask for the check.
We'd been looking forward to a special night at a lovely restaurant, but were disappointed."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Absolutely delicious. I ordered the lentil soup not expecting much but the flavors melded so well together. It was the most interesting lentil soup I've ever had. I had the linguine with seafood, which I was told was like the cioppino with pasta. The squid was the most fresh I've ever had. My date had the pasta in the picture below. He said it was okay. We were seated outside and I enjoyed the people watching. Overall, a very pleasant experience with delicious food."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time after a recommendation from a friend. The Carpaccio di Manzo was lovely. I ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole, and in my pasta, there was an abnormal amount of garlic cloves, totaling around the same amount of clams. Noticing this was unpleasant and unexpected; however, the overall flavors were delicious! The service was satisfactory; the waiter left our menus on the table after dropping off our appetizer. The table was too small to work around this, and it was difficult to flag down an employee as they were not the most aware of their surroundings. I will say they were very on top of refilling our waters! 4/5 for food, 3/5 for service."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I can only judge the pasta. As a 30 plus year resident of Italy, Tre Lune commits, in my opinion, the three deadly sins for preparing pasta for guests... first, no salt in the cooking water thus pasta is tasteless. Second, pasta is over cooked... terrible. Third, portions are overwhelmingly big...unappetizing. A restaurant of this caliber should know better. Service excellent, ambience excellent, overall a very nice dining experience in Montesito... too bad the kitchen hasn't learned a thing about making a good pasta dish."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"1. Service a real problem.
630 reservations and our food came at 8 o'clock. We did get our salad course maybe 15 minutes before eight. The waiter was very rarely seen. He did not come and check on us. Even after the food was delivered we were not given service. I nearly had a stand up to try to get someone's attention for salt.

I understand restaurants are dealing with more customers and some are struggling. Tre lune is supposed to be top notch. You certainly pay for it. I know they know better. They could've come over and offered to refill the glasses of those drinking wine, bring more bread, offer an appetizer, do something. When you make a 630 reservation you do not expect to be eating at 8 PM.!

2. The food was fine. Wasn't as good as last time

3. Seated inside yet we made reservations over a week in advance when it was only outside seating available.

We were sat inside, - . I wish they had advised us of that. Now we know to pay more attention to the rules changing as even if you make a reservation when it's only outdoor seating if things change it's no guarantee you will have the outdoor seating.  

Sadly that meant her friend needed to wear his mask most of the time. It was not a very comfortable dinner. Add that to the excruciating long wait and it was a really disappointing experience"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune doesn't need another review to tell people that they are a tremendous staple in Montecito - they have been doing consistent, exceptional dining for a persnickety clientele for ages.  However, I felt compelled to drop this review because last night our app order was lost in the ether & when my husband arrived to pick it up the place was packed, as usual.  They could have been dismissive, however they we effusively apologetic, made my husband comfortable at the bar, checked on him often, prepared our order promptly & then threw in their delectable chocolate mousse gratis for the delay.  This is a business you want to support."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,never really go to italian restaurants too often and if i do it's typically a pizza joint so i figured this would be a step up from the usual. fortunately i wasn't disappointed but i also wasn't impressed.  i ordered a mixed greens salad to start and the mushroom chicken marsala as my entree. it was average at best i probably wouldn't come back especially since it was quite pricy for what i ended up getting. very nice ambience though! i sat outside.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I went for lunch this past week. And, it was fantastic. Ice tea was perfectly brewed. My napkin was Italian linen - something I didn't notice before. The Caesar salad was perfect and I ordered the clams linguini and it was incredible. The flavors were really good with perfectly roasted garlic.   Service was impeccable.  I had not been for a while and my experience brought me back to why I love this place. 

And, they did the right thing with their employees and families over the last year which I respect."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Came here for dinner tonight. Happened to be restaurant week. My sand dabs were INEDIBLE. Tiny paper thin portion drowning in oil and super fishy. When I received the fish I asked for a lemon. Never got it, nor did the waiter ask how it was. I brought it to managers attention who was crazy. He said ""what it's fish, nothing I can do. I wasn't your server"". WOW!! salad was fine and the veal was fine but mine was clearly not touched. $250 2 restaurant weeks and 1 split order of pasta for kids. Judge for yourself but that it simply outlandish in my opinion."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"This was the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant.  The service here is one step below Olive Garden.

I took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner, along with one of her girlfriends.  We were seated at 7:45 for dinner and did not get our check until 10:00.  It took 2 hr 15 min. to be served a Caesar salad and a Veal entrée. 

After initially being seated we waited 30 minutes for the server to take our drink order and he only came to our table after we asked a busboy to find him.  

We did get numerous apologies during the course of our meal but truthfully the apologies got old, especially since every time our server apologized he would subsequently disappear for 30 minutes.  We actually came to the restaurant to eat dinner, not to participate in practice sessions on how to apologize for shitty service.  

Anyway, needless to say we'll never return to this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone.
  
Oh by the way I forgot to mention, they were so screwed up they brought out our entrees before our salad lol."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune is consistently good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The staff couldn't be nicer, service is outstanding, and I've never had a bad (or even mediocre) meal here. They also have the best espresso martinis in town...Some favorites:

Breakfast:
- Rose
- Sunrise Surprise 
- Any of their benedicts 

- Stone Crab Claws (a special sometimes)
- Ellen Salad
- Any of their cheese / charcuterie boards to start
- Fettuccine mare e monti 
- Fusilli Aristocratici 
- Linguine al Gamberi 

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Highly recommend making a reservation for lunch / dinner as they can get very busy."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Absolutely the best pasta I've ever had! We had a magnificent butternut squash stuffed pasta in a walnut cream sauce, that was just to die for. The food is magnificent! I highly recommend you try this restaurant!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We went here for my sister's 30th birthday dinner and wanted to have a special night out! I had heard amazing things about the food, and yes the pasta was great, but I will never return due to the horrible service we received from our waiter all night long. We had Roberto as our server and he spoke no more than 3 words to us the entire night. I had to finally ask the busser for water for the entire table after trying to flag our server down for 20 minutes. I had prepaid for a nice bottle of champagne to be delivered to the table and had to ask the hostess and manager 3 times to have it brought over to our table. Not only did Roberto and the rest of the staff treat us like we were nothing, he went ahead and added 20% gratuity to our bill. We had assumed due to our party of 6 this was a typical added gratuity, but come to find out, after calling the manager to complain about our experience, they informed us that this restaurant never adds gratuity to parties. We spoke to both managers, each one telling us they will call us back after discussing our experience with one another. It's now been 2 weeks, we've called back twice, and have yet to be contacted by either manager. I will never go back here no matter how good our food was, it's not acceptable to treat anyone like this. No, we may not be their usual crowd of celebrities and wealthy Montecito residents/visitors, however, each one of us still managed to spend $70 on our drink and meal and with that price should come an amazing experience. This is a perfect example of terrible wait staff and management."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Mine is a long story but in a nutshell.... 

Good food, SHIT service. NEVER will return!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"My first time eating at Tre Lune and I will say it is one of the best Italian places in the Montecito area. With so much tradition and such a lovely staff, it's sure to be on my list of ""must visits"" when I'm in the area. I ordered the Fettuccine Mare E Monti, a dish I highly recommend if you're in the mood for a rich, flavorful pasta. I also recommend ordering a glass (or bottle) of one of their many Italian wines. It was such a lovely night and I can't wait to return!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Great breakfast. Salmon Benedict had perfect hollandsise sauce and potatoes were crisp, large and delicious seasoning. Service excellent. I love their dinner also. Mac and cheese, risotto, penne arrabjatta. Can't go wrong. A little pricey but quality."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"New to Montecito village, we so enjoyed this restaurant! It has very good food and service. A wide variety of ​typical Italian dishes very well prepared."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"This restaurant is the most pretentious and awful place I have ever been to. Though, Tre Lune, has a charming and welcoming aesthetic appearance, it's insides are like the gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel. 
My Mother and I walked into this cafe on a whim, holding little knowledge of the cuisine offered. When we asked the male host to see the restaurant's menu, we felt as though we were asking a brick wall. The host responded to our menu request by not lifting his head from a reservation book and answering a phone call. This clear willful act of ignorance was followed by pointing us toward the street. 
At first we thought the host was kicking us out, but in actuality he was pointing us toward a menu displayed outside. As every business has one pretentious customer service employee, we abided to the finger pointing demand, because we were hungry and still willing to give this café a try. The menu looked yummy as it showed us a list of breakfast items only made with healthy food. As we were hungry, we walked back in, only to make one of the biggest and very expensive mistakes of our lives.       
The overpriced food was served to us an hour later. Though we were starving, it was hard to ponder eating the slob in front of us, as it was cold, even though it had been clearly sitting under a heat lamp for a long time. The egg yokes were hard, the sausage did not taste like sausage, but rather spam, and the juices were warm. 
I can simply summarize, Tre Lune, as just a horrible place to experience. Though It normally breaks my heart to rate businesses on yelp with one star I have no regrets giving, Tre Lune, this low rating. It is a place that pretends to be high class, but rather humiliates people and provides the worst customer service. 
The disgusting eggs, sausage, pancakes, and uncooked chopped potatoes with seasoning are a disgrace to titling Santa Barbara as the Mediterranean coast, therefore, I do not recommend anyone, especially tourists to even consider Tre Lune.  
Please, do not stop by, but if your willing to give it a try, then be willing to cry."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"From the reservation making to the dessert, the experience was fantastic. The only complaint was waiting on the hostess who was talking to a group of friends while we stood and waited to be seated, but beyond that we were nothing but pleased. We sat inside at an intimate table for four. The tartare was fabulous. Everyone got a soup or salad to start as well as their own entrees. The linguine with clam was incredible. The veal chop Milanese was also a table favorite! We loved our service and the overall ambiance of the experience. Will absolutely recommend to friends and be visiting again in the future."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"1. Fabulous service by Gabriel (Gabby). He was attentive and though you could not see his smile you felt it 
2. Good food as usual. - they split the salad for us   I love the mushroom pasta 
3. Tiramisu special occasion was a real treat. 
4. Good wine selection and fine cocktails"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The food was great the service was HORRIBLE. I had to ask and ask  for water and finally went to the bus boy.  Our waiter (bald, tall) never checked on us.  Won't be going back. Management was alerted didn't take the time to care."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Tre Lune is a real gem.  The food is outstanding and Leslee, the GM is incredible.  Due to COVID, we haven't been able to come down and see our 95 year old Dad, and wanted to do something special for him, for Father's Day.  We ordered a bunch of food from Tre Lune and Leslee knew him well enough to also suggest a bottle of his favorite wine.  She also insisted on taking it over to him, herself.  My brother and I were blown away by this level of customer service.  I can't say enough about this restaurant, run by this amazing woman.  Five stars forever.  Tre Lune - grazie mille per aver reso il giorno così speciale e memorabile. Hai un cliente per la vita.  Grazie mille!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,I don't alway write reviews but when I do there is a reason . First of all the food just okay . The service ..... well we waited 1 hr and 15 min to get our entree which I mind you was plain pasta with cracked pepper . The salads no taste ! More hype than actual treat !
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Did a quick google and ended up here as I was driving from Cambria back to LA. WOW!!! Best pizza I've had in Cali. Surprised in a great way. They even have local stone crab claws. I always thought only in Miami. They were huge and fabulous. The watercress and endive salad with blue cheese, walnuts, and pear was thankfully not sweet but crisp and delicious. Then the pizza: Gorgonzola and mozzarella with speck was hot out of the oven with the crust blistered and thin. Added their wine special from Sicily to go with this. Very impressive. I have a few favorites here but this blows them away. Even the bread and 3 choices of olives, pesto, olive oil was perfect. One happy guy!!!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We have eaten at Tre luna many times. We have ""taken out"" wonderful food from the restaurant many times. We have supported small businesses in Montecito throughout many of the difficult times. We  have been very involved in the restaurant industry also. BUT...we have had several experiences that we feel are not OK! Family of 8, reservations for 3 weeks, special occasion, and verbally informed that with a 5:30 Reservations we needed to be out by 7:15. At 7:15 we still had not received our salad and  half the family had to leave due to kids not receiving dinner for 2 hours...or even offered butter pasta. As we were told this was due to many take out orders, which we had also done to support our local Restaurants. But maybe on a Saturday night you  should cut take out  off after ""too many"". Please..Tre Luna at least treat your customers with respect and understanding. Offer a free drink or at least speak with the table and say you are sorry and what can you bring the table. Also I was  with my husband and I spoke with the manager, but they took the bill to our guest without asking. Honestly the evening had been ruined and it wasn't the firstl times. Too bad at such a great restaurant with very  good food and good service....Please get your fairness and act  together."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"To be perfectly honest, I love this place. Or did until my last visit. I have celebrated birthdays, births, life, people's memories after they have passed and just any occasion to eat at this place. But the last time I was there for lunch something happened that surprised and disappointed me all the same. 

My friend and brother and I were there having a late lunch. Eating, drinking, being marry. We had been there for some time as had the couple sitting next to us. A woman who works there (manager possibly) eventually came up to us as said that we would need to clear the table soon and they had reservations for dinner. She didn't mention anything to the couple sitting at a four top next to us. 

Now I'm not saying she is racist, but I wonder. I feel like we were discriminated against. To the best of my recollection, i have never run into this before. My friend has. Many times. I wasn't sure how to handle it because it is such a tricky situation. It isn't blatant, but it is. It is just a hunch. And it really is gross. 

I almost went back to the restaurant to confront this woman. I regret not doing that. Not only to stand up for my friend, but to stand up for my own beliefs and everyone else who has experienced this anywhere. I'm so incredibly disappointed in Tre Lune."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"This is the first restaurant I have found since the pandemic that hasn't suffered in quality. We had so many fantastic choices, that we shared as many dishes as we could stuff ourselves with. 

We started with the insulate di crescione with blue cheese, pear, endive and walnut which was light and very tasty. The stone crab claws special appetizer was amazing- sweet and meaty with just the right subtle sauce. 

We shared 4 entrees- all outstanding- the Ossobuco was tender, meaty and the risotto was perfect. The battutine alla parmigiana (veal scallopini) was also a large portion prepared perfectly. The lombata ai porcini (veal chop) was large and melted in your mouth. The pollo alla parmigiana (chicken parmesan) was huge with a great sauce and very cheesy. 

We also HAD to share a pasta dish- t(wanted to try 4-5 but...) he fettuccini mare e monti (lobster fettuccine) may have been the best pasta dish I've ever had, with what seemed like meat from a whole lobster. 

We finished with two of the best deserts I've had in a long long time- the tiramisu was sublime- light and subtle yet with distinct flavors of coffee and chocolate. The bread pudding with gelato was truly outstanding with just the right creaminess.

We finished with a glass of delicious apricot desert wine- a Ben Rye Passito di Pantelleria- the perfect ending to a perfect dinner.

Leslie was the best host- helping with selections, recommendations and with the touch to make guests feel welcome and pampered- something lacking in most fine dining establishments. She was the icing on an already wonderful cake.

Such a huge menu with so many more things to try. I know now why some people come for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. Can't wait to come back."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,The food is great just one little detail that it will ruin the experience...If you don't have a reservation they put you in the bar with very unconfortable high chairs.. So make sure you call first...And don't do the bar..you will regret it..
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"We had lunch in their new patio, service was so good. They created a special dish for us, I had the special which was halibut and it was cooked to perfection. It's a little pricey for a lunch date but this is montecito, it was all worth it. Thank you!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"I celebrated my 30th birthday here with friends. We had a below average experience. The food was excellent. My review is for the terrible service with our waiter Roberto. My parents surprised our table with a nice bottle of champagne. My sister had to ask for this 3 times when it was supposed to be set up and already at our table when we sat down. Roberto, our waiter wouldn't acknowledge us. We would have to flag him down every time we needed/wanted to order. At the end of the meal he added 20% gratuity. We called the restaurant and come to find out the restaurant NEVER adds gratuity for parties. We have yet to hear back from the restaurant on their response."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,Insanely overpriced for the food and portions. Nice atmosphere. Food is good but not great.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"Fake Italian food by non italian cooks. Pizza was bland,  and pasta dish,  despite the fancy name was unitalian and way too sweet.  None were authentic tasting and all were incredibly overpriced."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,The best breakfast in the Santa Barbara area.  Professional service with a smile.  I enjoy recommending this quality establishment to friends.  The best french toast in town for kids and very good Huevos Rancheros for adults.  Try the egg sandwich?
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,I don't think I've ever written a restaurant review. But I have to share HOW AMAZING this restaurant is. Have been two times over the past one year -- both times were the best meal we've ever had. Got the lasagna and truffle gnocchi. YUM. Will be back for years to come!!
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,Literally the best Italian food in SB. Everything my group got was amazing!! The service was kind of slow but that wouldn't stop me from coming here. I'm sure things do t run as easy with COVID so it's understandable. Definitely get the cheesy pasta with sausage. It was a must!! There were so many pastas I wanted to try so I will definitely be back.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,This was my first time coming to this restraunt and I was very very very impressed. It is quite pricey but worth every penny especially for a special occasion. All the wait staff were so nice and always made sure your water and wine glasses were full. I highly recommend for all occasions.
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Paul the manger and. Lucia the greatest server Ever ever !   The food was fantastic and Paul the manger is the best!!!! Life is very hard for restaurant mangers.  But Paul never said that!  I know that from friends that own they're own restaurant chains.  
Thank you for letting us be able to let us share!!!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,Terrible hostess...Food was amazing atmosphere was amazing but our hostess was absolutely terrible ... we were told by Ariana the hostess told us there was no availability for a table tonight  we went on OpenTable immediately got a table ..we walked back up to the hostess table where she was and we were sent to a table..Really love restaurant but  wish that the service was better so sad newly moved to Montecito was hoping to find my new favorite restaurant
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"This place was amazing, the menu is expansive, minestrone soup good, cacio e pepe wonderful, lasagna wonderful, pizzas great, we ended up eating here twice in two days.  Service is very attentive and good."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"I drove up from Los Angeles to Montecito just eat here with me and my boyfriend. It's our go to date night spot. 
Ambience is adorable and they have Frank Sinatra playing. Food is incredible. 
Their cacio e pepe is the best I've ever had. 
Their gnocchi with truffle cream sauce is very good. 
Good crowd too. 

Only thing that's disappointing was their dessert, I've yet to have a good dessert. Maybe if they added cannolis to the menu permanently or an incredible Italian cheesecake that would help things out."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Everything here is amazing, but I must say (yes, even as an adult), get the pizza. It's to die for. The last time I went here I ordered pasta, which was wonderful, but I couldn't stop myself from staring at the pizza sitting on the table next to me. Very authentic. Yummy! Can't wait to go back."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"The food is fabulous, however, the service has much to be desired.  We made a reservation for 11:30 am on a Saturday thinking we'd still be in time for breakfast and arrived at 11:26 am.  We were told that breakfast had stopped being served 20 minutes ago.  When we voiced our disappointment, instead of the server saying, ""I'm sorry that we can't accommodate your breakfast needs, the kitchen has switched over to lunch,"" the server bluntly said, ""If you don't like it, you can leave.""  So we left.  This is a place we have frequented often over 20 years and many of our friends eat here on a regular basis, but I can no longer recommend it to others knowing that they might receive similar, rude treatment."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"This was my first time after walking by so many times. Unfortunately the price does not match quality. The chicken was skimpy pieces and I found a piece of plastic in my food!! Ugh waiting  30 minutes for an order placed over the phone and then getting a piece of plastic! I am so sad because the pasta was not bad despite it's sad look and the plastic.

When I first walked in I was not even greeted nor knew where to go. Stood by the register by the door only for a rude waiter to tell me to go upfront. Upfront where!? But the woman who attended me next was fantastic!"
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,negative,"We had a reservation but waited 30 minutes after our time to sit down. The service was poor. (I don't believe it had anything to do with Covid) We waited an hour for our food with no explanation.  When it came, it was nothing special. The Osso buco should have been cooked longer and was not worth $50. 
Disappointing."
S3QHy1sshUeZwXOYviVsXQ,Tre Lune,Italian,positive,"Have been wanting to try this place for a while ! Definitely worth the wait. The service was very good everyone was so sweet. 

Food was to die for. Sometimes I find that I feel so gross and heavy after Italian, but this meal I feel so light and so so satisfied. The tomato cream sauce was incredible which were in 2 of the dishes we got 

Highly recommend the lobster fettuccini! It was so rich and had unbelievable flavor 

Make sure to get a reservation on open table! So worth it"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Everything was just soooooo good! Nothing to complain about at all. I called ahead to put my name down for a table, was told there was a 30-40 min wait at the time. We arrived about 25 min after calling and we were seated right away. Abbie was our waitress and she was so fun, had great energy and super attentive! I would love to have her as our waitress again. The food was delicious! We ordered the Zuppa special, insalata romana, paparadelle with porcini mushrooms, prosciutto pizza and spinach ravioli in brown butter sauce. Everything was amazing, just the right amount of food and taste was not overwhelming. We also got dessert, a trio of gelatos and a puff pastry with berries. Great way to end our dinner. All of the staff that helped us were very nice, the restaurant looked great, a minimal style vibe. Can't wait to go back!"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,"As always we love the food! Wait staff awesome. Computer went down waited 45 minutes for bill waiter was very apologetic. Never saw manager. Never saw a discount, dessert, or drink for the wait a bit frustrating"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Fantastic to have Ca'Dario come to Goleta!! We had terrific service, good food, and enjoyed the (relatively) upscale vibe."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,"So my husband just came back from the Goleta ca Dario very upset. First of all their computers were down he was sat at the bar nobody served him until he asked if he was in the wring place? It was 10 minutes then they came and took his order Explained their computers were down. When his arugula salad arrived it was
Wilted.  He also ordered the pizza special of the day which was a sausage pizza that looked really good on the menu but when it arrived it had crumbling pieces of sausage canned olives canned tomatoes he was not impressed. When he got home he was very angry and wants me to post this I did not go out tonight because I ate a late lunch.  I'm very disappointed because I was at Ca Dario last week downtown and had a great lunch now my husband tells me he will never go back. Dario please take care of this mess because you have a really good location in Goleta and we really are excited about you being here but I feel that something needs to be done take a little more pride in the restaurant.   $50 for a bad experience.  Not good.  2 glasses of wine. $24.  oH my"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"We had great service, great food and a great experience! Chris the bar tender recommended the bolognese and it was INCREDIBLE! The Vino is as you would expect from a GOOD Italian restaurant... amazing! Go here, expect great service and food and have your expectations be met."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,"Nice place, pleasant, new, terrific atmosphere, so so food. The acoustics were thoughtfully done, service is attentive, efficient, and pleasant. Bar looks nice. We had two Italian reds, both good, if not cheap. The menu has options at a wide range of prices. The food is attentively prepared, but frankly we would not return to eat it. Pizza margherita cheese had separated on my pizza (and the other served pizzas I saw), leaving an oily texture. Ravioli and pizza flavors were overdone and both dishes were heavy. Salad overdressed. Sorbetto in the freezer appeared slushy with liquid. We feel there are much better Italian options downtown SB. Ca Dario is a nice place. It definitely needs much better cooking."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"It was our first time to stop at Santa Barbara, Goleta, and looked for nice Italian food for our dinner. We were lucky to find seats without reservation. By 5:30, the restaurant was fully packed (Friday evening). 
Atmosphere was very friendly, and a lot of family also enjoyed for dinner. 
Food was also great. We ordered pasta and it was good feel with al dente. I have no complaint on the taste of dishes so far. 
Overall, we would like come again when we have a chance to visit Goleta again !."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"This place was an awesome surprise!!! We went here last night and enjoyed every aspect of our dinner. It's busy on weekend nights so I'd suggest reservations.

The restaurant is a little hidden between the laundromat and the French press. However, inside is very spacious. The host led us to our table close to the back and we immediately got delicious bread and olive oil and ice water. We each chose the prosecco to drink. I chose the ravioli with spinach, ricotta and butter-sage sauce. It was delicious. My cousin ordered the same dish and she enjoyed it as well. 

The service was efficient and friendly, despite the place appearing very busy. The food arrived promptly and was enjoyable. We will definitely be coming back. This is a great addition to the Hollister/Elwood area."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Walked in last night and sat at the bar.  The manager, Danny, was great.  Asked him for some recs and seriously had one of the best meals we've ever had in Goleta!  Ordered the eggplant parm appetizer (for a main dish), the ravioli with butter and sage, bucatini all'amatriciana, and the caprese salad.  All were SO GOOD!  Other note is Local brews by M Special and Captain Fattys on tap - excellent wine selection!  We will be back!"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,"Ca'Dario recently opened in Goleta near by K-Mart area. This place is pretty big! My boyfriend and I got seated right away after our arrival. We split the risotto since he wasn't really hungry. The food was okay! When we were about to leave, we noticed the waiter served bread in the beginning for the couple next to us. And we realized all the other tables had bread. We were bummed out that we didn't get any."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,"My meal was not very good tonight. Had the Lasagna Bolognese from the Specials Menu and the sauce was so overwhelming that you couldn't taste anything else. It's was too creamy and cheesy and not very flavorful. It actually tasted a bit burnt in places against the extremely hot bowl. My husband had pizza - just ok. Ordered the pear tart for dessert and it wasn't very good either. Disappointed. Our waiter was very nice, however. Bathroom was dirty- paper towels and garbage on floor."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Came here for my 21st birthday. The food & service were amazing!! I got the ciotola di mare with noodles added, suggested by Abbie (the best waitress ever, seriously). They even brought out tiramisu on the house for my birthday! Everything was perfect, can't recommend this place enough!"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"I have mixed feelings writing this awesome review for this place, mostly because I want it all to myself. Ordered the margherita pizza and an Italian beer and couldn't ask for more: fresh ingredients, friendly service, and even the game on the TV over the bar. Like their downtown location, these guys are doing good stuff and I'm all about it."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"I have been waiting to try this new place in my neighborhood, and I was greatly impressed both with their amazing food and service! We went there with 8 people including 2 kids for Saturday lunch. Every one of us had a wonderful food and enjoyed them so much! I am so happy to have this little place in Goleta!! Now I don't have to drive all the way to dwntwn SB to get authentic Italian food!"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"The best fine dining option in Goleta, by far. I was already familiar with their downtown SB location and had high hopes for their new Goleta location. They did a great job renovating the new space into a nice open and inviting atmosphere.  Their kitchen is exposed to the clientele, so you know what's going on and can see how clean and profressuonal their operation is. Their wine selection is great and their food is simply wonderful! It really is hard to pick the ""wrong"" dish. This place is definitely worth a splurge, as it's certainly not a cheap place to dine, but the food and atmosphere combo is really nice. This is a really good ""hot date"" and celebration kind of spot, if you're looking for one around Goleta without having to go all the way to downtown SB and have to worry about an expensive round trip cab or Lyft ride back if you have some wine (which you should, of course).

Definitely give this place a shot!"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Walked in at closing hoping for some tiramisu and luckily, not only was a I greeted with a friendly smile but got my tiramisu, even though they were out and made one fresh especially for me! Now that's customer service. And... it's delicious by the way!"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,Loved trying out the new Ca Dario spot because I love the original on Victoria so much.  It's very well done inside - this little shopping center is lucky to have them!  It's a little on the pricey side for what you get but it's still a lovely spot and a pizza and a salad can be split quite nicely between two people and you will be completely satisfied.  I totally recommend it; the price point is just a tiny bit high for what they offer.
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Walked in at closing hoping for some tiramisu and luckily, not only was a I greeted with a friendly smile but got my tiramisu, even though they were out and made one fresh especially for me! Now that's customer service. And... it's delicious by the way!

UPDATE
Officially our favorite place for Italian food in SB! Stopped in something savory and satisfying. We chose the Ravioli al burro e salvia and it was delicious! Highly recommend!"
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,The food was just as good as the downtown location.  The inside space was well laid out with open kitchen design.  They could use a little wall art as it's a little sparse but not cold.  My only knock would be that they need to expand the wine list.  Selection for dining in Goleta is limited so Ca'Dario moves to the top of the list easily.  I hope the community supports them as they are a little more expensive then what residents normally encounter locally.
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"So nice to have a good restaurant in Goleta.  Our server (Jacqueline, I think) was great!  She is a vegan and so am I and was able to help me pick a meal that I loved and even a desert!  I got the Putanesca but she recommended having it with spaghetti and no cheese.  My husband got halibut and really liked it.  We were served promptly and had no complaints about the service.  My only negative was the manager (we were there Monday night for dinner).  You would expect a manager at an Italian restaurant to be a little outgoing.  The manager didn't bother to seat us, greet us or say thanks for coming.  The hostess was busy preparing to go meals and with no one at front the manager should have stepped in and offered to seat us."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,Best restaurant in Goleta. Hands down. So glad they finally opened! The original Ca'Dario is a Santa Barbara institution.
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,"Great food, delicious wine, I love the portions. But the staff can be friendlier or more welcoming."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"We showed up about 9:15 and the manager told us the kitchen had just closed. We told him we found them on Yelp which indicated they were open till 10. We also told him it was our 37th anniversary. He asked us to hold on while he spoke with the chef - came back and said they would seat us! The rack of lamb was melt-in-your-mouth tender, cooked to perfection, and soooo delicious. I love, love, love garlic and the generous portion of lamb came sitting in very flavorful pan drippings and covered with several cloves worth of crunchy slivered garlic. My wife says I ate it while moaning with my eyes closed. Nice wine list yielded a wonderful Tuscan red that paired nicely with my lamb and and my bride's fillet of sole. She says there were too many capers, but the fish was incredible. We stayed and drank our wine and closed the place down. Wonderful food, wonderful service, wonderful evening. Looking for a great meal in Goleta? This is the place."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,"Stopped here for lunch. It was very empty for lunch time. But I understand it's still new. It all looks very nice inside. We were a party of two. The table top for two is super small. We were greeted and seated right away. We were asked if we wanted sparkling water or regular water. Then our server came back and asked us the same question.  He also pointed out the page of specials. Everything sounded really good. Prices seemed a bit high but good Italian it can be that way. They left bread and a little thing of oil with a little bit of rosemary dropped in. So very little it was as if it was accidentally dropped in. They oil didn't taste infused. It tasted like plain olive oil. I was just wanting a salad so I ordered the Roman salad and asked for chicken added. My salad was $8 and the plus chicken was $5. There wasn't $5 worth of diced chicken on the salad but ok. Chicken was also very dry. The salad was nothing special and I wouldn't order it again. My lunch date ordered one of he panini sandwiches with a side salad. I had a bite of her panini which tasted really good but was way more bread then meat. It's not bad but there are so many places near back to pick from, I probably wouldn't be back. Guess if I wanted bigger heartier meals or pizza or pasta this might have been better. We just wanted a nice light lunch. The server did how ever come and ask us how our meal was 3x's. Which just seemed a bit much but it was really slow. There were only two other tables or people. One was a single top and another was a larger group of maybe 6 or 8."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,"This restaurant has potential but I think it needs some time to find its feet. At the time we were here, they had only been open a month. It is a convenient location and easy to find. It's located in a shopping group, so there's ample parking. We got a good first impression from the barkeep and hostess; however, there was some squabble among the serving staff after we were seated and we waited and waited for someone to come greet us and get us started. My husband finally went and fetched someone, after which we got a little attitude from her, although a few minutes later, we could see she had adjusted. They do have an extensive and very Italian menu. I think they could do with a tad more ambiance; it is very modern decor but not that ""warm"". Maybe some classy modern art on the walls, with some bold color, would help."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"So glad that Ca'Dario set us a table in Goleta!  The service is impeccable.  The restaurant is still getting itself organized but the servers and management are absolutely on top of things.  The food is very good.  I had the pasta special of the day: beautiful al dente pasta and a fresh sauce.  Very tasty Italian comfort food and just what I wanted. 
There may need to be an adjustment period for pricing that is in keeping with the local economy.  I read they are going to set up a ""small plates"" / happy hour menu:  good idea!  I will definitely be back."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,A wonderful Italian restaurant with a great atmosphere. Casual yet still moderately elegant. They offer a wide range of options while still including authentic Italian cuisine. A bit pricey but you definitely get your moneys worth. Okay for families. Mildly romantic.
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Had a great lunch at Ca' Dario today!  Started with grilled vegetables as a shared appetizer and they were excellent.  I had zitti alla putanesca, which was delicious.  My wife had the Ravioli and it was also superb.  Attentive service and nice ambiance.  Highly recommended."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"This was a great find in Goleta. My wife had the spinach ricotta ravioli. It was excellent. I had the baby sole in a white wine/caper sauce. Very nicely done, with the fish cooked just right- not overdone. Google maps didn't have them in their maps, and we had to drive around the block once to find it-located in the nicer part of the ""strip mall"", next to the Chevron station. (Don't let that deter you. The decor is nice) The staff are efficient and friendly. My wife had the lava cake-special dessert of the evening, and it was done well. I ordered the biscotti with sweet red wine, but they were out. I changed to strawberries in red wine. This was garnished with mint. Not to my taste, and would not recommend it. Overall one of our better dinners in the area."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Gonna agree with many of the reviewers. It is good and I am glad they are in Goleta. But, they have to get better at service, food consistency, and wine menu. It is not good to have only one option of a variety of wine by the glass. Overall I am still giving it a 4 cause I am glad we have an Italian food option in Goleta and Pascuccis 2.0 is gone! Will be back again."
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,"Wow! Just had an incredible lunch that reminded my wive and I of being in Italy. Beautiful simple surroundings, great service, and perfect simple food. And in Goleta at that. The best for many miles around.

Started with a classic carpaccio of beef- elegant and tasty. Then split a seafood risotto- perfectly cooked rice, creamy with barely cooked crab, scallops shrimp and a touch of fresh tomato. Incredible. Next a Margarita pizza - great- and finished with a Tira Mi Su that was light, not too sweet, great coffee flavor.

Our waiter is very attentive. It didn't take for our food to come out and it was the right temperature. The amount food is just right for a hungry adult.
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,negative,The spaghetti alle vongole was subpar due to all the sand in my dish. It was a pretty underwhelming and disappointing dish. I was chewing on sand with most bites and then at the bottom of my bowl was a small pile of sand. I wouldn't come back or at the very least order any seafood from this place. They clearly don't know how to properly clean and prepare this dish but they charge high end prices. My husband's barbecue chicken pizza was a sad excuse for one. We threw the leftovers out. Frozen pizza is better than theirs.
9xW7LsJpyhVZFRb6z9xorg,Ca' Dario Goleta,Italian,positive,Came in with a party of 6 tonight. Food was amazing and our waitress Natalie made the whole experience memorable. We ordered the chicken coccio with a local Pinot noir and my boyfriend ordered the special halibut and she recommended the Chianti reserve to pair with this dish. Everything was so amazing and the rest of our party agreed. We will definitely be back for the amazing food and memorable service. Goleta needs a place like this. 10/10

Now that's customer service. And... it's delicious by the way!

UPDATE
Officially our favorite place for Italian food in SB! Stopped in something savory and satisfying. We chose the Ravioli al burro e salvia and it was delicious! Highly recommend!"
